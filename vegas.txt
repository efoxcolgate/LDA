It was my feeling that although it had been a useful tool \u2014 a daily statement about gun violence in America \u2014 The Gun Report had run its course. During the year and change that we published it, readers got a close-up look at the many forms gun violence takes \u2014 the horrifying incidents involving children shooting other children; the drive-by shootings; the shootings that result from a moment\u2019s rage; and so on. There weren\u2019t just one or two shootings each day; there were 30 or more. On weekends, the carnage was horrific. The Gun Report also became a place where gun proponents and gun opponents could voice their views in the comment section.\n\nBut a few months ago, I began to feel that we had made the point already. Day after day, week after week, there was a numbing sameness to the shootings. And to be blunt, most of those who posted comments were not getting closer to finding common ground than when we began. So I decided that it was time to bid it adieu.

Semi-automatic rifles are capable of killing large numbers of people within seconds. The fact that you can pop off more people with a fully-automatic rifle does not change that fact. And it does not change the fact that the semi-automatics are all too easy to modify.\n\nNote that because machine guns are highly regulated, they are rarely used to commit violence. There is a lesson there, regardless of whether the murderer's weapon in this case was a legally-obtained machine gun, an illegally-obtained machine gun, or an illegally-modified semi-automatic. It's odd that few in the all guns everywhere camp acknowledge that gun safety regulations do work. They work where they are applied, whether in other countries, or in the United States with respect to automatic rifles. Maybe it's not so odd.

To the masses from my side (liberals) of the aisle. Fully automatic weapons have been against the law since the 1934 National Firearms Act that ban all fully automatic weapons. Since then, you have to go through a serious ATF background search, pay a federal tax stamp, and get the OK from your local law enforcement chief or sheriff, etc. The media keeps talking about it was legal until 1986, that's a falsehood or half truth. In 1986 no further manufactured fully automatic weapons were to be made for public purchase. Also, you can't convert a semi-auto AR-15 to a fully automatic M-16. To go full auto it require's a different trigger, hammer, sear, disconnector, and bolt carrier. Not easy for almost anyone to fabricate. For about $25,000 you could buy a pre-'86 fully automatic weapon, but only after you get the OK from the Fed's, local/state police, and pay the federal tax stamp. There's a few devices that can fire almost as fast as full auto, but they jam and this loonies gun didn't sound like it jammed, though he had a line-up to choose from. From listening to the audio, I'm 100% certain he was firing illegal fully automatic weapons. In many decades, there's only been 3 crimes committed with pre-1934 banned fully automatic weapons. The easiest to convert are open bolt Mac-10 type weapons. So, why if he had a automatic weapon need any other guns? Maybe because altered guns are likely to break down during use.

By comparison, a fully automatic M16-A2 has a rate of fire of up to 950 rounds per second.

I can't imagine what would make a sane person do something like this--which leads me to believe he was not sane and that something made him snap. I can only assume because his brother stated he was a gambler that he lost all his money or that because his female companion was not with him, that the two had a falling out, or that she left him because he lost all his money.  As to addressing Alive and Well's comments about the 2nd Amendments. If you wanted to subjugate people, how would you go about doing that? First, you make them completely dependent on their government. Then, you take away their ability to defend themselves. While I cannot in anyway shape or form justify what this man has done, there are gun owners who live their whole lives and never hurt anyone. The philosophy that if you take away guns and make it illegal to own one that you prevent murder is ludicrous. It is illegal to own a gun in the city of Chicago but someone forgot to tell the criminals who made that city one of the murder capitals of the world that. I don't own a gun but I understand wanting to have one for self defense. Criminals don't care about the law and as long as we share a border with two other countries, you'll never stop them from coming here illegally. If you disarm the law abiding citizens, the only people who will have guns are the criminals and terrorists.", "createDate": "1506984048", "updateDate": "1534890458", "approveDate": "1506974165", "recommendations": 4, "replyCount": 3, "replies": [{"commentID": 24294653, "status": "approved", "commentSequence": 24294653, "userID": 0, "userDisplayName": "ebmargit", "userLocation": "Ann Arbor, MI", "userTitle": "NULL", "userURL": "NULL", "picURL": null, "commentTitle": "<br\\//>", "commentBody": "We always have to make laws for the weakest link in the chain.
