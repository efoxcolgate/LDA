For those who equate your right to live as your right to be able to defend yourself with weaponry is where your argument becomes twisted and deluded. The world watches you as you continue to kill each other and we have become densensitized to these shootings knowing you will do nothing about them and they will happen again. Rather than pray for Vegas, pray for those who can't see reason. If your society makes it so easy to acquire and own guns, does it matter what the motive is anymore? There is no logical reason to have them in the first place and you can look to other countries in the western world as evidence of how mass shootings don't occur at all or nearly as often because we don't cradle rifles like our lives depend on them, because they don't.
