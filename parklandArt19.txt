It seems to me that the passage of gun control would have a chance in this nation only if one of two things were to happen: the execution of a high-ranking congressional conservative (or a close family member of same) or a general strike by America's high-school students, not necessarily in the classrooms (who on the right would care?) but rather against such money-making industries as movies, recording, clothing, cell-phones, publishing and so.  Once there's money involved, perhaps our representatives will feel impelled to spring into action. Until then, our kids might as well walk to school wearing targets on their backs.
