In the Canadian system, there are three classes of firearms and firearm licences: non-restricted, restricted and prohibited. Prohibited firearms are not forbidden outright, as the name might imply, but their legal possession and acquisition are dependent upon their registration history and an individual's firearm licence. As of December 1, 1998, the prohibited clause must be grandfathered to acquire or possess prohibited firearms. New prohibited licences are available only at the discretion of the Chief Firearms Officer of the province or the RCMP.\n\nIndividuals who wish to possess or acquire firearms in Canada must have a valid possession-acquisition, or possession-only, licence (PAL/POL); either of these licences allows the licensee to purchase ammunition. The PAL is distributed exclusively by the RCMP\n      ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo these seem unreasonable???

All boys in our society are bombarded with erroneous messages that tell them that to be \"real\" men they can't have emotions, which in turn means they are not supposed to have compassion for others, and also that violence is expected of so-called real men.  Watch portrayals of \"real masculinity\" in Hollywood films to see this.\n\nTypical messages about masculinity are based on the contention that to be \"real men\" boys and men cannot, essentially, be fully human.  Our society  harms boys and men by not allowing them to be fully human, and by normalizing violent masculinity in which most male violence is directed at other males.  Women too are victims, but not at the rates that boys/men are victimized by other males.\n\nThis is an explanation based on empirical research on the topic, it is NOT an excuse for such heinous behavior.  People need to see how society contributes to normalized male violence to find the best way to end it. When we finally stop making ideal/stereotypical masculinity so limited, so impossible to achieve, and so dehumanizing/violent, and start accepting the fact that masculinity can be highly diverse and should not be about physical violence and control, gun laws won't be necessary because the connection between masculinity, guns, and violence will no longer be accepted.\n\nOf course that will take some time, so until that time we must fix our gun laws, immediately.

There are other rational that gun lobbies and enablers toute such as the second amendment but only through a distorted lens and reading of the actual intent of the documents wording. It's time to move away from the simple 18th century tones of a young nation struggling with the lessons learned from its emancipation to the realities of a nation where we call our neighbors enemies ( based on their race, religion, or political affiliation) and deny the actions of our real enemies.\nThe problems posed by guns are exasperated by other problems based in fear, intolerance and forgetting that cooperation and compromise are essential traits of our democracy. In order for us to fix such problems within our society, such as gun violence and opioids, we must address the systemic problems related to our attitudes towards these issues, accept and acknowledge the core disease, and work together for solutions.\nMaybe rectifying even this one major risk to our safety will show the pathway for other major national and world issues.", "Lets propose an economic model, something that Republican's understand and love. Who are the benefactors that will support Republican legislators in this quest? Republicans legislate to line their pockets. Can we ask that gun laws be similar to driving laws, a huge money making industry? Everyone is eligible to drive but must pass certain tests to ensure the safety of others. We restrict cars from children, so why do we allow kids to access to guns at home and allow teens to own guns? Gun owners should meet certain requirements for health, sanity, age, intent of use, etc., just as drivers do. Imagine if just anyone could drive on the Expressway? Do driving licenses restrict liberty or ensure the liberty of others? Can a blind person buy a gun? Ask those with guns to pay liability insurance and guarantee their use will not infringe upon our own right to life. Demand common sense, Right to Life After Birth laws.

We need to transform society.\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/...", "The campaign for gun reform has gone about it the wrong way.  It has gone with the assumption that lawmakers can be reasoned with, appealed to with statistics and evidence of solutions working around the world, but that is the wrong approach when it comes to lawmakers and the people who fund their political campaigns.  They only thing they understand is the costs to their campaigns and themselves.\n\nSo we need to change the context of the conversation by changing the approach.  Right now the gun lobby has privatised the profits from guns and socialised the costs.  We need to turn it around make it cost the country dearly for holding on to the interest of the gun lobby.  We need to make the US pay in every industry for putting guns before children.  Tourism is the first, then trade, and then we need to isolate the US from the rest of the world until the pain is felt by the lawmakers.\n\nIf there was a law that made every lawmaker personally liable for every loss of life due to gun violence until they repealed the second amendment and replaced it with a more reasoned and safe approach to guns, it would be voted and ratified within the hour.  Money is the language of lawmakers, so it is time to let money do the talking and matching $10 for every dollar the NRA provides to the opponent in this coming election.  If the US doesn't solve this gun problem, the rest of the world will by isolating the US and trading less with it.", "I just watched a YouTube video that is going viral, a very brave young woman passionately addresses the apathy and condoning of gun violence by Trump and most Republican politicians who continue to support the policies of the NRA and the gun lobby.   She and her fellow students were present when this recent mass killing at Parkland, Florida took place.\n\nAs she says, students are tired of the 'thoughts and prayers', she says 'We Call B.S' to the many lies told after each school shooting.  I could not watch this without crying, it is so moving and so much from the heart.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxD3o-9H1lY", "Thank you for your searing and honest eloquence.  May this nation finally have the courage and hope to bring change.", "There is no constitutional amendment that gives our children or ourselves the right to be free from the threat of gun violence, but the second amendment has been interpreted by politicians to give gun owners the unfettered right to proliferate their caches of weapons to the peril of the rest of us.  Blaming the mental health of the shooters is a red herring because the gun laws don't prohibit someone who is mentally ill from owning a weapon.  They prohibit someone who has been \"adjudicated mentally ill\" from buying a gun, but ironically, even AFTER committing mass murder these shooters are never adjudicated as mentally ill.  See James Holmes in the Aurora shooting, for instance - the court refused to declare him mentally ill.  If he hadn't been convicted of a felony, he would still have a second amendment right to buy more guns.", "While I have never voted for a Republican, and I vote every time there is an election, this time after the 17 lost lives, I felt like I had failed them. I have not been as proactive as I could be. After watching one of the videos taken by a student and hearing their screams, I decided that I had to do more than just vote. I have started to write/call/email every legislator who has received any funding from the NRA, and I've started to ask my friends/colleagues to do the same. I have some hope, especially in seeing the teenagers in Florida who are afraid of bullets, but not afraid to speak. They are asking, demanding, that our lawmakers fulfill their responsibilities and enact legislation that will address their very reasonable expectations. I want to live in a world where my young daughter can one day have her own child, my grandchild, and never have to worry about that child's safety in school because of the lack of common sense gun laws that we have now. We have to make our voices heard, never giving up until change comes about. We owe it to our children.", "I had enough after Columbine. I joined Million Mom March and became an activist. We lobbied the Texas legislators and held events and mailed letters. Our success was measured in how many committees the bill would get through before it died. We got nowhere. I couldn't understand why our society didn't rise up together and demand change. And we're still here 19 years later, even after Sandy Hook. I have a glimmer of hope with the teens speaking out. I hope they are the ones to help us finally vote out gun-supporting legislators."]
