Yet, I could go into gun shops and legally buy 42 high-powered rifles and then buy \"bump stocks\" over the internet which have the sole purpose of making those rifles even more lethal - all without showing up on any law enforcement radar.  What kind of values or logic do we, or members of Congress, have to permit this? And please do not tell me that the Second Amendment requires us all to be held hostage to guns as the \"price of freedom,\" as Bill O'Reilly said in the aftermath of the horror, or that we should simply learn to \"get small\" as targets,  as grotesquely suggested by Sen.

It's hard for me to believe that our dominant political party is so fully motivated by white supremacy that a white mass murderer's supposed right to bear arms is more important to them than a black man's right to express his view that we haven't lived up to the principles symbolized by the flag.

The willingness by a lot of people to hide behind the Second Amendment. The Constitution was written in the age of the musket, when a well-trained soldier could load and fire two or three times a minute. I doubt our forefathers and the framers of the Constitution envisioned a weapon that could fire upwards of 500 rounds a minute and would be turned on innocent citizens. <br/><br/>In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the \"Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.\" Obviously, that criteria was  not met in the senseless carnage inflicted on so many people that night in Las Vegas. <br/><br/>Perhaps it is time for those in a position of power, namely the Executive and Legislative branches of our government, to consider what was the real spirit and intent of the Second Amendment when our forefathers wrote it, and take legislative steps to limit the ability of those who don't use weapons for \"traditionally lawful purposes\" to be able to inflict as little damage as possible.", "com#": 352}, {"articleID": 6, "comBody": "What rules?
