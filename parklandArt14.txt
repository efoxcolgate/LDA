Turning schools into war zones is not a solution.  Thats like saying hospital trauma centers are the solution to mass suicide.  Arming teachers treats the symptom, not the disease.  And to top it off, it's a lousy treatment.  Gunman kills 20 kids before shot by teacher is not an acceptable result.  Claiming that he could have killed 50 is no victory.  We still end up with 20 dead kids.  We still end up with terror.\n\nGuns are truly a public health issue just like opiates.  They are an addiction that kills.  Methadone is not a solution to heroin.  The problem is our society is flooded with opiates.  Our society is flooded with guns.\n\nGuns are everywhere and they are too powerful.  The AR-15 type weapon is an attack weapon.  It is designed to take as much human life as possible.  No one needs this type of weapon for self defense.  \n\nWe are all vulnerable.  We all have to depend upon our neighbors for safety and survival.  This is a fact of life.  Owning an assault weapon does not eliminate that vulnerability.  In fact, it increases it.  Now everyone is vulnerable to all the others who own the weapon.  So people buy more guns in hopes of outshooting everyone else.  More kids die.
