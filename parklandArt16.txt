It can be repeatedly fired by a child and can be reloaded in seconds.\nThe AR-15 can fire 800 rounds in a minute, has a effective range of over 2000 yards and a muzzle velocity of 3200 fps.

What's going to happen? Well, back in 1966 there were no controls for boarding airliners so people also brought guns on board those, too. And back then there were regularly-occurring hijackings like to Cuba. Solution? Controls. Metal detectors at airports. The number of hijackings fell precipitously.\nWhat we are going to see are more and more controls in the USA, such as to enter schools (already), malls, theaters, museums, and the like. I'm sure President Trump is against gun control, well except maybe for properties/places he's visiting.

They are sticking plaster solutions, and in many ways they just further exacerbate the problem. Americans today live in an atmosphere of fear. They bring up their children to live in fear. In such an atmosphere people will necessarily become obsessed with guns. Many people feel having weapons is necessary to feel safe. It is a sickness of spirit that needs to be addressed. Feelings of fear and anger have become a normal way of life.  Both fear and anger readily breed violence. More attention needs to be paid to what actually constitutes good mental health in society.  Is a society that is obsessed with reality shows and celebrity culture a healthy one? From top politicians downward, there is so much unbalanced behaviour and lack of integrity that we witness every day, Is it a wonder that unbalanced behaviour begins to manifest at all levels of society? Every child deserves good mental health, deserves to be given the tools to understand and manage their own thoughts and emotions, rather than being medicated when these things become troubling.
