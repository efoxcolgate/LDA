"1 See some things that are untrue and just opinions, hard to use this as an actual lesson.  Could use parts maybe.  Research or just using google to get actual facts would be nice., 1 This article has some great information about working through trauma with your students, and the role of the school community, particularly immediately after a traumatic even takes place: https://blog.heinemann.com/when-world-community-or-school-news-is-upsetting, 1 Maybe is parents parent their kids right, then this wouldn't happen. If you introduce your 10 year old to hunting with guns, boom, then you wonder why kids are shooting up schools. How StUpID do we have to be? DUH., 1 What evidence do the police have that shows the attack was premeditated, or planned?, 1 I want to start by saying i can not  imagine what families are going through. I think we should start at the root of the problem. Our kids. We have all done it  Made fun of other kids, not his fault his parents cant afford new clothes. not thinking about how he feels when he is pushed down the stairs and everyone just laughs as he runs away. Until he has taken all the bad things in life his mind can stand. he wants revenge. You have to be stupid to think if he wants a gun a law will stop him! Oh there is a law i guess i wont be able to shoot up my school now! Really\" So johnny wants a gun he goes to the gun store the gun guy says you have to pass a background check and wait two weeks. Johnny says hell with that goes down to the corner where Joe is always hanging out hey Joe i need a gun i have money. Joe has no background check. meet me here in two hrs, not two weeks. Johnny has his gun in two hrs. I cant believe we think of fixing gun laws when we should be fixing our kids! A sick shooter is going to shoot, it doesn't matter  what laws are past. Its against the law to abuse a kid to the point where he feels like killing. Lets think about saving the kids before they get to that point. Our Kids need to think of how miserable that kid is every time you call him names push him down hurt his sole. then blame on a gun when he pushes back. It starts with parenting and friends. Next time the poor kid wheres funny clothes be good to him he already has it bad enough! , 1 People will say that its not the guns, but the people. That is just stupid. If the people that have the guns are mentally unsound then we need to take the guns away from them.\nSome people will say that outlawing guns will only keep it away from the average person and only criminals will have them. However, people who have remote access to them black market don't do crimes like this, they assassinate people and don't get caught. Also nearly every gun that is on the black market was purchased legally and is then sold illegally.\nI have a personal message against those who say \"Bannin' guns don't work because bannin' drugs ain't workin'\". You actually are breaking 0 on the IQ test. People can make drugs in their basements with prescription drugs. If we outlaw guns and their part people can not go and build an AK47 or AR15 or any assault rifle. People don't build guns in their basements because they can't, it is terribly easy to make drugs. , 1 I would give a failing grade 'D' to all of the 'Professionals' who responded, here.\nNo one should be at school \u2014several days of mourning are called for. More mourning and psychological activities should be planned for the high school, for a few days, upon return, and only go to school half day.\nA special lunch and community outpouring of their love and support should continue for a while.\nIt should not be business as usual!!!!!!!\nThink outside the proverbial box, for crying out loud!!!!!!!!!!!, 1 How do we protect travelers on united states airlines...???  If we put highly trained shooters one every flight in the united states....how can we not protect our children in the same manner??   We do the same for most industries in this country., 1 KIDS Need to follow the routine for reassurance and to focus on the feelings of safety, support and protection they have toward school.  Also, they need to contrast there feelings when then perceive themselves as threatened and wonder who will keep them safe.  The approach must address both positive and negative feelings.  Most challenging for kids is to have fear, to verbalize it but still feel threatened  by the killings they have heard about in schools, homes and communities.  Teaching children what they can do to protect themselves will help them to believe that they can cope with the fear they feel because of the shootings.  Kids should be encouraged to seek out identified staff members in school if they believe that they have seen or heard something dangerous.  Role play may be effective, but should be limited to the adults providing examples of potential threats.  The focus needs to be on what triggered the fear in the child.  What did you hear?  How did you feel?  What did you think could happen?  How can we make it safe?  The role activities must be structured and focused on:  1)  Reporting what triggered the sense of threat, fear or anger; 2) Stating the feeling the child has; and 3)  What are three things you can do to make things safe?  For example, 1) tell the teacher;  2)  tell the school security person; 3)  tell the school nurse or counselor.  Also it is important to teach the kids about the school plans for what happen:  Lockdown; hide; pretend to sleep., 1 Here's an idea to reduce gun violence, domestic violence, and punching incidents, a problem in schools which can lead to gun violence.  The United Nations' World Health Organization says every year billions of dollars are spent worldwide on injuries related to punching incidents.  Punching incidents often escalate in to using more deadly weapons - guns, knives, etc.  Reduce punching incidents and it should reduce gun violence.  One Punch Homicide was made to reduce punching incidents, it's getting great reviews, and it can be seen free online.  ShelterMe - its actual spelling - Nebraska, a domestic violence shelter, wrote \"I encourage you to show it to your kids.\" about it on its facebook page., 2 As others are saying, mental health is not the issue.  The data referred to by David Leonhardt say it all:  https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-i...\nThere are plenty of mentally ill people around the world, but no other country has anywhere near the number of guns or the number of mass shootings that are in the US.  We simply must force our representatives to stop being controlled by the NRA and, if they won't make the right choices, vote them out of office, and not a moment too soon.  , 2 Nikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Showed \u2018Every Red Flag\u2019 and His New Parents Still Let Him Keep Guns!, 2 Cruz was a ticking time bomb. \n\nIf Gov won't make laws that address these shootings then states need to make laws that address people with a profile of someone like Cruz who raises so many red flags. \n\nSomeone at schools needs to be assigned to gather all the information from parents or guardians, students, doctors and police and make a decision on how to handle someone like Cruz before he goes postal. Just transferring him to another school is not addressing his serious problem of violent tendencies. \n\nWe have hundreds of thousands of Autistic children/people in the country. As a rule, they are not known to be violent but recently, some males have shown, that they were turning to violence.  \n\nOut of all the things Cruz did to raise red flags, killing animals is a sign of a sociopath. He was able to go to a fast food place and eat after killing people and then take a walk as if nothing happened. \n\nhttps://www.app.com/story/news/crime/2018/01/05/long-branch-shooting-did..., 2 This poor boy..., 2 sounds like this insane person has been doing every thing but standing in front of the police station screaming for help, 2 The YouTube comment said \u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter,\u201d\u00a0\nSchool shootings have become so normalized that it has become a profession. , 2 A glaring example of how everyone dismissed this kid including the FBI.. Nobody really cared until seventeen layed dead in a Florida High School., 2 Every American gun owner has children\u2019s blood on their hands today. , 2 Those who give up freedoms for security will soon have neither.  Get the weapons of war off the streets instead of trying to lock up the mentally ill., 2 All this so that members of the militia can have a right to own their muskets., 2 Compare the religious right's attack on women's choice and reproductive health with the progressive's \"opposition\" to guns.\n\nWhich group is committed and wants to win?, 2 So wait, the governor of Florida wants the head of the FBI to resign when a state-run school system and law enforcement certainly answerable to state leadership did nothing but send this kid to another school? We wouldn't be talking about this kid if assault rifles weren't handed out like gumballs., 2 First of all, most people with mental problems are in denial and cannot be forced into treatment (and then for a limited time o0nly) unless they are \"a danger to themselves and others\"   Even when they are  involuntarily transported to a hospital for a mental health  evaluation the maximum time they can be held,  in most states,  for observation is 3 days, then back to the street in a revolving door fashion.  Agreed that the mental health system in the US is another disaster.  But what difference would it make otherwise?  Let's not forget that one of the first executive orders that  Orange Treasonous Trump signed, to much fanfare,  was to reverse a previous Obama order  making it impossible for anyone adjudicated as mentally ill to buy weapons.   It is a sad day in this country when any mentally ill person can walk into a store and purchase weapons meant to inflict the most carnage, more easily than they can get medication without a prescription, apply for a job  or  buy a car.   You have blood in your hands Mr. President and so do your enablers at the WH and in Congress.  We will remember in November.  And last while  many other countries have populations with mental illness, and anti social behavior, they are not able to act out on their evil  intentions because, unlike in the US, access to guns is strictly restricted, as it should be.  , 2 So IQ45 is going to  focus on dealing with mental illness - perhaps he should start with his own mental illness.\nMental illness is not killing people, guns in the hands of mentally ill individuals are killing people. Do something about the easy availability of guns for sale, 2 If there\u2019s not a father, or a good father, around, a boy needs an older male figure to mentor him., 2 The profile of Nikolas Cruz by the Washington Post (and others) was more comprehensive than the Times, because they highlighted Cruz's years of animal abuse (so indicative of future violent behavior) and the instances of his adoptive mother disputing/denying his cruel acts when they were brought to her attention.  When was the earliest that he and his family received mental health counseling?\nIt is also unbelievable that an 18 year old in Florida can't buy a beer or hand gun, but can buy an AR-15!  This is what happens when you have a Republican one-party state and national government tied to the NRA., 2 The terrifying reality: there is no legal way in the U.S. at this time to prevent an adult with high-functioning autism from buying guns. (Cruz may have been diagnosed with autism; he, the Sandy Hook shooter, and others appear to fit the profile.) Such young men are badly disabled in terms of forming strong relationships; many become estranged from their families. Facing massive frustrations, they are subject to bouts of towering rage, even the ones who are talented and intelligent. Because they don't think and relate the way we do, we perceive them as \"different.\" They make us uncomfortable. In school, this inevitably leads to ostracism and cruelty, They don\u2019t forget these acts of cruelty.\n\nThe smart ones can learn to \u201cact normal\u201d and can conceal their \u201cdifferentness\u201d from most people for periods of time. Have them committed, and they will convince the keepers that they are rational, well-behaved, not a danger. They will get out, harboring a huge grudge for those who put them in the cage.\n\nAs a society, we are too lazy and too stupid to figure out how to deal with these people, to provide them with the help they need to heal from their traumas, to find a productive and tolerant place in the world, and to prevent them from exploding like anti-personnel bombs. A lucky few manage to find their way by themselves.\n\nAs a parent if you can find one of the very rare psychologists who are not completely clueless about autism, you will still get zero help from the legal system., 2 Well our society loves individual freedom so we're struggling to deal with people we don't care about until they do something horrible. He was basically an orphan and he had family issues and no one took care of him after his family was there for him. His community was that small. His crimes are inexcusable but it's very understandable. He just didn't hang out with the right crowd. If he got interested in the arts or something he could be a little kinder and artistic and maybe that could have expresed his struggles. But he chose guns and violence instead. It's human nature to be selfish and if he didn't have enough social skills I understand that he turned out sad or angry. I'm not sure if it was better for him to commit suicide or homicide. They're both so sad but we only care about loud and clear misfortunes like this school shooting. His parents clearly couldn't wished this to happen but he couldn't act any other way since the parents didn't teach any better. No one cared about him really and you know, I don't either. If I was a neighbor I would move away asap. We could keep feeding him in jail until he dies naturally and waste any resources on mental health professionals but let's be honest. No one would really want to work with him for free. His parents were responsible for him but now he is under the state's responsibility. I hope people in Florida can afford to pay for the psychiatrists for him. Eventually the society pays for any troubling individuals., 2 There is nothing about any of this which does not ring of tragedy. , 2 A few thousand people die from terrorism, and we increase security at airports and facilities across the nation.  We create a web of rules and regulations that we hope will prevent terrorist attacks. We invade nations in the name of rooting out terrorism.\n\nTens of thousands of people die each year from gun violence, yet all we can do is offer prayers and condolences and throw up our hands and say, \u201cNothing can be done.\u201d  What\u2019s wrong with this picture? \n\nI don\u2019t want to hear one more word or prayer or condolence from any Republican when it comes to gun violence. Save your breath.  This is the predictable result of allowing Americans to possess guns.  So keep your mouths shut until you\u2019re ready to open them and say, \u201cLet\u2019s talk seriously about gun control.\u201d, 2 Regarding the posting that the shooter made on YouTube (and under his REAL name) if our illustrious FBI doesn't have the capability to locate the IP address and otherwise pinpoint the author of the post, then the US has got serious problems., 2 What about NRA? We have overlooked this RED FLAG! Since the mid-1930s the NRA began an advertisement campaign to possess guns and guns and more guns as we all let them continue abetting them in their business of senseless death., 2 If it's valid to blame those of us who support the second amendment for the shootings, then it's valid for us to blame those who support illegal immigration for the deaths caused by illegal immigrants.  Must be consistent here.  , 2 America has become an uneducated, divided, racist rabble hopped up on the myth of exceptionalism and armed to the teeth. Someone like Nikolas Cruz does not really stand out in such a society so why is anyone surprised that his 'red flags' were not noticed? In a nation with a clear lunatic as a leader and a government that simply does not care if its own children are slaughtered Cruz is simply an average Joe., 2 Since when do mass murderers get to be referred to as \"Mr.\"?, 2 Why does the NYT find it necessary to state that the shooter was adopted? If the paper insists on delineating bloodlines, then in all fairness, the paper also needs to let us readers know if the subject of an article was conceived via IVF, was the result of an unplanned pregnancy, etc. etc. Sheesh, it\u2019s 2018. Stop with the bias already., 2 Putting this photo on the front page of the New York Times is irresponsible. Mass murderers seek fame and you, The New York Times, are helping them. Coverage should be limited to the victims of these horrible crimes., 2 He looks like a fetal alcohol case.  I wonder about his prenatal life and before he was adopted., 2 The NRA doesn\u2019t care for the lives of children in this country. GOP politicians don\u2019t care for the lives of the citizens of this great nation. They are more interested in making money making guns acceptor every idiot claiming his/her right to bear arms. , 2 Let me see if I've got this right.  A woman can believe she was sexually harassed or assaulted, accuse the man, and he immediately loses his job and his reputation.  This is considered to be a very good and brave thing for women to do.\n\nBut a caller to the FBI with first hand knowledge of someone making frightening and dangerous statements, that will involve far more than an unpleasant date or an awkward pass, is violating the offender's civil rights of free speech, according to the ACLU.  We cannot act on these statements/threats until he shoots up a school. \n\nWhat am I missing here?, 2 every commercial  firearm should have a computer chip, when activated, prevents it's firing. schools could transmit a signal that deactivates while police guns are unaffected. simple., 2 I was sorry to see another mass school shooting in America.  What needs to be done is the police and the military are the only ones to have guns.  Let the NRA people keep their guns but do not sell any more ammunition of any kind to the public.  That will be the only way to stop this senseless violence.  Trump is giving us lip service on talking about mental health and asking people to seek it.  Well guess what the GOP hates mental health and it is the first to be cut in any of there health care plans or the premiums they make are way to unaffordable.  I hope Americans won't forget that and don't believe there lip service now., 2 Media, as a reflection of the nation\u2019s desire for and  receipt of biased reporting on these  types on violent incidents and perpetrators do more damage to minority communities...and it is obvious to the communities of media targets...and it is always amazing that media never claims to notice or attempts to moderate reporting through an equity lens that does no additional harm or provides affirmative action favoring Whiteness. \n\nMy lens sees the horrifying inequity. Why does media\u2019s lens support what it claims to abhor?, 2 \"Kids were really picking on him and would gang up on him and beat him up a little...They ostracized him. He didn\u2019t have many friends.\u201d\n\nI hope those who bullied him read this. I hope their parents learn of the bullying so they can help their children recover from being bullies. I hope the administrators of the \"school for students with special needs\" look into Mr. Cruz's experience at their school with an eye to introspection. I hope no one thinks that the laws can cure the problem of violent mass shootings in our schools. The law is a violent construct. Violence begets violence, it does not ameliorate it., 2 This guy was sending up red flags everywhere.  But few or none of the other recent multiple killers did.  No one around them suspected they would become violent, and most appeared quite normal.\n\nPay attention to warning signs.  But that can only solve a small part of the problem., 2 It is understandable, but limited, to ask, 'why did the FBI not pick up on his mental health issues on social media'? The FBI are not mental health professionals. The FBI are likely little more competent than anyone else in analyzing social media. 'Mental health' is one of the great canards of our time; everyone has mental health issues. Analyzing social media posts is not a solution to prevention of crime, and only happens in the aftermath of incidents., 2 I was sorry to see the shooting in  the Florida school.  I think the only solution is to ban bullet sales to the public  for the safety of all Americans.   The mental health issues are one of the first health care plans Trump and the GOP cut in any health care plan.  So we need to keep reminding them of the consequences of their bad governing.   , 2 At our office this week, there were flyers distributed everywhere about what to do in the event of a gun attack.  How awful that it has to come down to this, the constant worry at work, school, home, etc.  Tears ran down my cheeks as I listened to those grief stricken parents in Florida describe the horror of what they went through on Wednesday.  The time for action is NOW., 2 I wonder whether some of these cases would be avoided if the media could reach an agreement never to provide the name or photographs of these mass killers.  How many of them decided that they will redeem their failed lives by becoming famous as record-holding mass shooters?  , 2 After reading this article I felt torn. I realize that this man has mental health problems but I don\u2019t believe that they are to blame for this massacre. Giving him  access to an assault weapon is the obvious reason why so many people lost their life.\nWe have a saying in my home country that translates to\n\u201c You can see the elephant filling up the room but you stab its shadow \u201c\nWe all know in our hearts why we have so many mass shootings but we are to paralyzed (for a multitude of conflicting rwasons) to dare to look that reason in the eye and tackle it.\nIt is the definition of insanity , 2 33,000 people died by guns in 2016 in the US, 21,000 of those were suicides.\nJapan had 27 gun deaths in 2016 and only 8 the year before. Japan has just as many crazy, angry people per 100,000 as we do but they dont have guns. There are 300 million guns in the US, but only 100 million gun owners, most of them owning only one or two guns, with the top one percent owning   dozens . \n\nTo get  rid of guns ban assault rifles except for well regulated militias.Then buy back handguns. At 1000 dollar per weapon that would cost a hundred billion , about the size of the Trump increase in defense spending. \n\nWhich would make you safer, another aircraft carrier or streets void of handguns? \n\nWhile you are at it, buy and close Remington firearms, which is going bankrupt due to the Trump slump., 2 Of course, deep condolences to all those affected by the shootings: those murdered, their loved ones, and the witnesses to the carnage - who must now somehow move forward with their lives, repairing and soothing their own mental health. The scarred survivors will now, most probably, confront the national cultural reluctance to regard mental illness (here, likely PTSD & depression) as something to *not* be ashamed of.\n\nAnd yet, is it obscene to extend compassion also to the shooter, to his apparent (yet unconfirmed) mental illness? I'm not diagnosing him, yet \"He would sometimes be hitting his head and covering his ears ... (his actions indicated a) screaming for help in every way ...\" \n\nMental illness is not weakness. What's weak, what's truly obscene, is our denial as a nation to prioritize helping both those who suffer from long-term mental illness - and those who are violently confronted with trauma outside the range of normal human experience. The shooter and the survivors both share the country's dangerous disregard for treating - and valuing - mental health., 2 So many unheeded cries for help from this young man. If only he could have gotten a diagnosis and proper help for his problems, especially the death of his mother. He was all alone and acted out. That in no way excuses his behaviour, or does it? So many young people died. Very sad., 2 Denying gun sales to Mentally unstable isn't impossible. Everyone who wants to buy a gun should undergo much more rigorous testing. Testing for psychopathy is not that difficult. Written testing, in conjunction to reaction to visual stimuli would indicate danger signs. We should take a look at what they do in Japan and other countries. Gun ownership should not be a right, like  water or air - the Constitution was written in 1787, the amendments in 1791, this situation is not what the founding fathers intended. We need to amend the 2nd., 2 All these \"red flags\" are incredibly obvious -- after the fact. There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking and 20/20 hindsight following this crime. If it's so easy to spot and stop a would-be shooter, I'd like the names of the next ten. , 2 As much as there needs to be a constant and institutionalized monitoring on an individual with potential harm to the society, our feckless gun regulation and purchase process needs an overhaul., 2 It's especially illuminating that Nikolas Cruz made efforts to immerse himself in violent groups.  He was reported to have joined a white supremacist group (though that is now in question), he posted something with the words Allah Akbar, he most likely posted a clearly worded threat to be a school shooter.  Now there is talk of an autism diagnosis, which in certain cases may mean a lack of the ability to empathize.  \n\nThere is constantly talk of how online groups feed the anger in lost souls like this kid.  I think we have to consider it in a different way, angry people with murderous thoughts seek association with groups that provide a just cause (phony for sure) for killing and maiming.  How else can one understand a kid that would seek out both a white supremacist group AND post the phrase Allah Akbar?  It seems to me that the case is pretty clear that mental illness, anger and violent tendencies are the consistent traits.  How can anyone - especially an elected official, justify not doing everything possible to block mentally ill people from acquiring weapons capable of mass killing?  , 2 I \"think\" some schools may try to handle violent acts internally and avoid filing charges with police.  So when the subject goes to buy a gun, there may be no record of violence. I could be wrong,  but I offer it up for others opinions., 2 With as much trouble as he had been in, why on earth did his mother and then the Sneads allow him to own and keep a gun? Even though it was locked away, he had the key! Other questions arise: If the deputies were often at the house, if he had killed animals--which has been reported elsewhere--and taken a golf club to a neighbor's trailer, stolen fish from a neighbor's pond, then why did he have a clean record until now? Where was the juvenile court? He has a brother who is a minor, so after both parents died, where were social services? This seems to me a failure of family, neighborhood, school and the FBI. I'm all for background checks (which, apparently wouldn't have helped here anyway), more guards and machine detectors at schools, and trying to keep guns away from the mentally ill, but this situation begs for some common sense and for lines to have been drawn in the sand a lot earlier., 2 Rick Scott belongs in a jail cell right next to Trump. They deserve each other. If Scott were serious about tackling mental health issues, he would have allowed for the expansion of Medicaid in Florida that would have led to increased access to mental health care in the state (this from the guy whose company had to pay a $1.7 billion fine for criminal fraud after bilking Medicare out of many more billions). If he were serious about not allowing gun violence to escalate on the state's school grounds and everywhere else in the state, he would have sponsored and promoted gun control legislation taking away easy access to assault weapons, especially at gun shows where background checks are not required. The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando should have given him enough impetus to do that. But, there were gay people of color killed there, so maybe the shooting there wasn't enough incentive for him. His reputation as the nation's worst governor has been well-earned, and he has the temerity to want to be a U.S. Senator after his second misbegotten term as governor is over. I hope more than 37% of voters go to the polls in the Fall, because that's ahppened twice when he;s run for governor, and he won each time by, 2 There are those that want all guns turned in, and laws passed to deny gun ownership to American citizens.  This will never happen!  What can and should happen is the passage of solid laws that require background checks for ALL gun purchases, the upgrading of background databases across the states and the Federal government.  No gun sales without a through the background check and that includes gun shows, your neighbor, etc., and the mandatory registration of all guns., 2 Autistic, troubled youth with difficult upbringing. This story is as much about inadequately raising kids with learning and emotional difficulties as it is about the ease of obtaining guns in America. , 2 I'm sick to see all these comments about the fact that it is a child's fault and we need to keep guns out of peoples hands. he is 19, He is an adult. When you turn 18, you are an adult. Yes, these things [school shootings] are horrific, but it is the fact that we need the people with mental illnesses like him, and others on the \" not to buy guns\" list. Maybe if everyone learned to properly handle and use guns this wouldn't be a problem. Its also common sense to NOT SHOOT OTHERS.  It is so infuriating to see that school shootings are still that big of a problem. The shooter needed help, as all mass shooters need. The only difference between this shooting and most other well known mass shootings is that he didn't commit suicide after. Most mass shootings, the shooter had killed themselves. He needs help. , 2 Yes, the FBI dropped the ball. But really, what difference would it have made? If they had followed up, all that would have happened was that Cruz would have been questioned. Could his statement that he was going to be a professional school shooter, his boasts about his guns, his erratic behavior, have constituted probable cause to arrest him for something that hadn\u2019t yet occurred? Doubtful. Could the authorities have confiscated his guns? He would and could have easily purchased another gun.  The inquiry has to start with the availability of these weapons, not with mental illness.  , 2 i'm sure it's been said already, but of course this was preventable.  No guns=no shootings.  It is literally that simple.  , 2 Unfortunately this will happen again, somewhere unsuspecting, someplace where the community will respond \u201cyou would never expect it here\u201d. And then that community can ask themselves what could they have done, but didn\u2019t, to prevent this tragedy. Closing the barn door after the horses have escaped isn\u2019t the answer. Take action now in your community to prevent this from taking place. Take action now. , 2 I want to articulate my thoughts on this and tread carefully here...but then again, why should I, when most rarely do that especially in sensitive situations like these.\nOne thing that bothers me, mental health has become the fallback on perhaps anger management issues, poor judgement that you cannot take back or just sheer attention at any cost.\nThere are many of us out there who've been dealt poor hands but resort to such extremes. How you react to your reality and past based on how determined you are to stop a cycle, change your path and not always play the victim. We are responsible for changing our own reality.\nAlso,I feel we are living in a culture where glorification of guns and these kinds of tragedies has become the norm and we are numb to it.\nAll that said, the NRA, this Administration & other lawmakers should not always hide behind mental health. Just saying., 2 Americans will someday have to decide which Constitutional protections are more important to them, those provided by the Second Amendment or the Fourth. Defenders of the Second Amendment have held sway so far, giving us liberal access to firearms. But the only way to prevent dangerous things from falling into the hands of dangerous people is to subject EVERYONE to comprehensive and frequent mental health evaluations, which sounds to me like a definition of \"unreasonable search\"., 2 Yes, in the end, Cruz is responsible, but so are the many members of Congress (and president) who offer phony prayers snd then quickly forget about the latest mass shooting. Might as well get ready for the next one, which happen like clockwork. Where will it be? Whose kids will be affected? Afterward, trot out our leaders, who say, \"it's too early to talk about legislation.\" NRA dollars are worth so much more to them than the souls of children and others whose lives are erased by bloodshed., 2 This will be my last year teaching and my last year in Fl. This plan was already in place before this but now I am highly motivated., 2 Want it all to stop?  Allow gun manufacturers, ammo & accessory makers, the NRA, their lobbyists, et al. to be sued for damages.   One law, one change.   Long past due., 2 I would also like to raise the possibility, based on photos, that the shooter suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome, which is often accompanied by particular facial and head features. People with this incurable brain affliction tend to be impulsive, violent, and aimless. This isn\u2019t to make excuses, since most people with FAS don\u2019t become mass murderers. My point, rather, is to be realistic about the probable roots of his problems and to highlight yet another way we are tragically failing our children as a society. , 2 This proves that attempts of successful intervention to prevent gun deaths by mentally ill people simply DOES NOT WORK. The only way to prevent this type of gun violence is to ban the sale of weapons sold for the sole purpose of killing people. It's such a ridiculously easy solution that I can't figure out why it is even an issue. Hiding behind the Second Amendment is equally as ridiculous. ALL of the legislators, lobbyists, leaders of the NRA and the like, are complicit in the deaths of these children and the victims of past shootings. When will enough be enough? When one of THEIR children goes to school one day, and comes home in a casket? Listen to the pleas of the students of Parkland, FL - we need to STOP this now. , 2 Sure, this young man had major mental health problems.  Sure, mental illness is a major problem in this country.   So what is our government doing about it, especially this administration?  Obama at least tried to mandate mental health care having insurance coverage parity with physical health care.  Let's say someone had identified this boy's probable personality disorders, possible depression, and potential for violence.  Was care available to him, in the quantity he would need it?  His widowed mother most likely didn't have the resources to pay out of her own pocket.  So how was he to get the help that might have saved 17 young people?  Our government is clearly unwilling to regulate guns at all, and in fact has made it easier for troubled people to acquire guns, so they blame everything on mental health problems.  Well, then, do something about mental health care., 2 The FBI dropped the ball. The school should have had better security-the police and officials dropped the ball. The school should have had a policy if you hear or see something, say something. This could have been prevented. , 2 The NRA's solution to protecting ourselves against violence is for everyone to be armed at all times. Yet a Chicago police department district commander who was rightfully and legally armed was gunned down in the middle of the afternoon in downtown Chicago earlier in the week while confronting a suspect. The NRA's  goal and reasoning are dumb and frightening beyond belief. I still want someone to explain how they, the gun manufacturers and the politicians who support them get away with setting the rules as if the rest of us are nothing. , 2 We live in an ailing society, an increasingly crippled nation. And for a vaccine, we must look to the same GOP Congress that is the agent of infection. How can we expect law enforcement authorities to spot single sick cells, when we're awash in disease?, 2 The Paris concert shooters, brothers, were also orphans. They grew up in the foster system. , 2 Red flags? Who's going to notice red flags, when you have Trump on TV every night, shooting his mouth off? Pun intended. Words are like bullets. This is the real cost of Trump. , 2 Millions of white men in the U.S. exhibit long trails of red flags that are only recognized retrospectively as such for the tiny percentage of them who commit crimes with guns. For most, acquaintances and family say, \"I knew he was struggling or a little off but I never thought he was capable of that.\" I don't say this to defend gun rights but to fundamentally limit them. The reason the \"mental health\" straw man is trotted out is because its advocates know a comprehensive community-based mental health intervention capacity will never happen, not even in the tiniest measure. The very term \"mental health\" has lost its meaning. Why? Because the spectrum of behavioral health issues manifests in millions of Americans.  Men, however, who are on the depressive spectrum, for example,  are far more likely than women to manifest symptoms like intermittent explosive disorder.  But this anger-related  manifestation of behavioral health issues is so common it seems to affect extended family members of nearly every family in America. And more than 90% of these individuals, these family members are undiagnosed. So what to do?  Make it much harder to purchase firearms. That goes without saying. Then regulate guns, ammunition and magazines far more tightly than the present. And yes, ultimately outlaw semi-automatic weapons altogether.   The details of how to do these things are not the difficult part. Making all elected officials accountable for their stand on the right to bear arms is., 2 Among other things, the top administrators of the FBI have been protecting the agency from the president.\n\nMany Russians have been indicted. In due course, more Americans will be indicted. \n\nWe mayl be looking at succession out to the Secretary of State... as none of those in line, VP Pence, Speaker Ryan, Senate Pro Tem OrrinHatch, are suitable. \n\nPresident Rex Tillerson? , 2 A person does not have to be certified \"mentally ill\" for us to be wary. There are those around us with anger issues, odd and or anti-social behavior, etc it is not paranoid to note these.  This is not to say people who exhibit these behaviors all act out by engaging in violence against others. Still they may be red flags. While we should not overreact every time we notice suspicious behavior, with the availability of guns it behooves us to be vigilant. We have to be vigilant as we are basically on our own since the politicians won't do anything as long as they are beholden to the NRA and gun advocates. Money speaks louder than the common good., 2 \u201cmental illness is to blame!\u201d Wrong. There is no less mental illness in the U.K. or Japan than we have here, but they don\u2019t have any mass shootings or gun homicides. The United States has HALF of all guns in the world! Might that have something to do with the fact that people are 50-100 times as likely to be shot here? No, couldn\u2019t be. Must be our mental health system., 2 Mental illness can be used to explain this tragedy: not in the perpetrator but in the legions of other Americans who support the gun-madness everywhere in this country. What need do any citizens have for unsupervised use of asault weapons? The rest of us are mad for tolerating this.\nI am afraid schools are going to need to institute screening for all who enter the portals as we have in airports. Doors should be locked and only authorized people admitted. At least until we solve the gun madness and gun sickness in our society., 2 \"Every red flag was there and nobody did anything.\"  Mr. Finkelstein said.  \"When we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help, in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?\"  This young man was very disturbed and was crying out for help but his cries went unheard.  He was bullied and ostracized by other children which added to his mental health issues.  In addition, he lost the one person in his life who truly cared (his mother)  and now he was alone.  He had no where to turn so he turned to violence.  What he did was absolutely horrendous but what society did to him was cruel.  Was there a caring adult who could have suspected his pain and taken him under their wing.  Was there a kind student who could have befriended him and spoken an encouraging word.  \n\nWe must be vigilant and start to be aware of the other Nikolas Cruz' in the world so this sort of violence does not occur again because a young man had no where to turn.  If just one person had showed some caring and compassion, this carnage might have been prevented.  We must step up to the plate and take imitative to those who are crying out in pain.  My heart goes out to the victims but a piece of it also goes out to Mr. Cruz too.\n\nLet's look for the warning signs of mental illness in a person and act before it is too late.  We cannot withstand any more senseless violence bestowed upon our youth.  It is killing our country., 2 Why would the NRA wish to put an end to mass shootings? Every time one takes place, there is a predictable (and very justified) outcry that nothing is being done to stop these heinous acts.  The NRA then gins the reaction into propaganda that the great unnamed \"they\" are \"coming for your guns.\" This in turn spurs more gun sales for the NRA's manufacturing overlords, and additional donations to the NRA to \"fight\" the \"impending 2nd amendment infringement .\"\n\nFor the gun industry, mass shootings are nothing more than an integral part of the virtuous cycle of gun sales.  Our lives, and those of our children, are nothing more than a marketing expense to be written against the cost of doing business.\n\nAnd, it keeps the contributions flowing to politicians., 2 This is all about money, isn't it? Government lobbied and paid by NRA, who is in turn paid by gun manufacturers, who are ultimately motivated by greed to sell more of what they produce. Then hit them where it hurts the most - the only thing they care about - their pockets. Can the laws be changed to allow victims to sue assault rifle manufacturers? I know that currently the gun manufacturers are essentially immune to these lawsuits, but maybe there could be an exception (and a very valid one at that) for assault rifles. You manufacture these machines of mass casualty, market them, sell them to kids, then you are 100% responsible. Then we'll see if the incentive to manufacture and sell them remains. , 2 I don't understand what people are proposing. As a teacher, I've seen my share of very disturbed students. And I've known many with mental health issues.\n\nThey have rights. They have legal & moral rights. Students who are disturbed have the right to be helped, yes, but when you see students who like to kill animals, then what? What exactly are you proposing? Who exactly should be prevented from having legal weapons? Clearly it cannot be all the  mentally ill -- talk about a revolting attitude toward mental health. So is it only those who are diagnosed as sociopaths? Very few are & of those, fewer still are diagnosed accurately. Where do we go with this? . \n\nI can be on board with raising the legal age to 25. That makes sense to me. Perhaps that will prevent some of the mass murders. It won't prevent, however, those done illegally (eg nearly all the ones in the inner city where I work, though the media doesn't care one iota about these kids' deaths, when white people are not involved). It also won't prevent any number of recent mass shooting deaths, eg in Las Vegas. Finally, the same people in favor of banning guns are the exact people in favor of porous borders--over which illegal guns can *easily* be shipped, & they will. So if we do violate the 2nd amendment & confiscate guns forceably (I can only imagine the results) we would still have a flood of illegal guns.\n\nLast, we used to have far more guns, not less.  So why are the shootings rising? , 2 Cruz is responsible for this.  Not Trump, not the FBI, not his birth mother, his adoptive mother, the schoolmate's family, the NRA or anyone else.\nNIkolas Cruz.  It is no more complicated than this.\nHe knew right from wrong.  , 2 I am not interested in Nikolas Cruz and what flags he did or did not show. I demand that people like him do not have unrestricted access to guns. , 2 Showed Every Red Flag !\nToo bad republicans couldn't have put a regulation on just One of Them.\nHe was allowed to purchase an AR 15, ammo, magazines...\nNikolas Cruz thanks you. You made it possible, made it so easy., 2 It is time to have a conversation as to why do we need Assault weapons in the hands of the General Public. I don't want to hear about the Second Ammendment. When the Founders wrote the Constitution the weapon was a musket. So let's stop all the side steaping. In the 1930's the U.S. outlawed the purchase of Automatic Weapons.  Are our Law Makers to concerned of losing their seat and to have this conversation? Will it take a tragedy that effects their Family for them to ACT. We got words yesterday From the President and Members of Congress. If America wants worrds they can go to Hallmark. America wants Action. It's a disgrace that 18 school shootings since Jan 1 2018 does Not Move those in Congress. How do they put their heads on their pillow at night? Does it take a tragedy to effect their familes to ACT?, 2 Going back  to the earliest mass school shootings, I've always wondered why the killers who had such obvious pathological profiles had not been identified as threats to the community before their rampages.  Cho, the shooter at VA Tech, walked around the campus for months, obviously psychotic and threatening to the point where several professors refused to have him in their classrooms.  Lanza had a long history of mental health issues and fascination with guns and violence, known by his mother, father, brother and others. There were teachers, school administrators, police, neighbors, and classmates who knew Cruz had a cache of guns and was \"off.\"\nWhy is there no process by which parents, friends, neighbors, teachers, employers, etc can make a confidential (but not anonymous) report to the local police about disturbed people like Cruz?  Many states have \"mandated reporters\" for child abuse - doctors, teachers, nurses, etc. who are REQUIRED to report suspected child abuse.  They should also be required to report  obviously disturbed people like Cruz that they know to be in possession of weapons.  Such reports could form the basis for police/social services investigation, possible commitment for treatment, and most importantly, for a search warrant of the disturbed person's residence to remove weapons.  A process could be developed so that the accused/mentally ill person could appeal the decision by police to remove the weapons, thus protecting their 2nd Amendment rights.  , 2 First, If the FBI is unable to keep up with the huge volume of calls they get about suspicious would-be mass murderers, why don't they pass the tip on to local law enforcement so somebody else could investigate? I thought law enforcement agencies cooperate with each other since Sept 11 attack.  Second, my suggestion is everybody expelled from school, dishonorably discharged from the military, convicted of domestic violence, or fired from a job should be banned from buying any type of gun from any source -- and all guns they own should be held by the local police -- for a 10 year cooling off period with a judicial and mental health review after the 10 years to decide whether it would be safe to give the guns back. Third, 17 killed in 6 minutes? Stop manufacturing automatic killing machines for sale to civilians. Confiscate as many of the guns already out there as possible and recycle the metal. , 2 Okay I'm going to say it, I think it's mentally ill for political leaders and representatives to offer up words of prayer after each slaying, and for people to accept this. First off gun kilings are not an act of \"god\", and second off it does not resolve the situation.  This American epidemic of gun abuse and use needs action, and anyone with a conscience knows this.  Prayer offerings are lazy, and ineffective,  the stage is still set for the next inevitable incidence., 2 First of all, Columbine happened when there was an assault weapon ban. So merely \"banning assault weapons\" won't stop these tragedies from happening. The Virginia Tech shooter committed his massacre with hand guns. So the only option that gun control advocates have if the really want to put an end to the violence is to repeal the second amendment, and good luck trying to do that. And even if you do succeed in repealing the second amendment, how are you going to get rid of all the guns in this country? There are more guns in the United States then there are people. Do you honestly think that everyone will freely give up their weapons, especially the criminals? Are you going to have law enforcement officials go from house to house confiscating everyone's guns? How would that look on national television? \n\nThere is a cultural problem in this country. Prior to Columbine, school shootings were rare, and guns were still a plenty. The question is, why are an increasing number of young men becoming so socially alienated from society that they have the desire to act out violently and harm so many others?, 2 Homeland Security urges \"If you see something, say something\". Except, of course, if it's the FBI you're telling.\n\nDavid Mamet is correct - \"the FBI couldn't find Joe Louis in a bowl of rice\"., 2 Americans should be fighting tooth and nail for less guns and assault rifles should be illegal. We need more checks in place to keep \"mentally disturbed\" people from owning guns.\n\nAlthough Cruz's adoptive parents were deceased, anyone who has raised a young man capable of mass killing should be held culpable. Parents of all school shooters deserve some blame. , 2 I'm struck by the fact that Cruz went to a friends cabin, accompanied by the friend's father, where \"Shooting weapons was a big part of the trip's allure. There were two AR-15s on the trip...\" So not just about mental illness but about a culture that glorifies weapons (and violence) and also a lot of bad parenting., 2 Another missed opportunity to stop a madman. Many reported their concerns to authorities and it fell on deaf ears. I am not pro-gun, but how many people need to wave the big warning flags before someone takes notice. In almost every case of a massacre in the U.S someone was aware and chose not to act on it or was brushed aside by authorities. There is a lot of blame to go around., 2 So an 18-year-old kids walks into the store and asks to buy a fifth of vodka.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to see some ID \u201c says the cashier, who quickly says he cannot sell him liquor because he is underage. \n\n\u201cWell then let me have a pack of Marlboros,\u201d the kid says. \n\n\u201cSorry but you are too young to buy cigarettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK then let me have an AK15 with 250 rounds and three 30-round magazines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be $238.16. Cash or credit? You want me to wrap it up?\n\n\u201cNo thanks. I want to shoot 30 or so people on the way home.\u201d\n\nWhat is wrong with this picture?, 2 I would support the call for more gun regulation, if I thought that would help.  We have laws and age requirements for tobacco.  Children smoke.  WE have laws and age restrictions for alcohol, and even banned it entirely for a while.  Children drink because they still have easy, though illegal, access, adults drink to excess and drive, in spite of severe consequences.  We ban certain drug/substances and sentences for drug law violations have given us the highest incarceration rate in the world.  Drugs of all kinds are available to an one who wants them.  115 people a day on average die from drug use.  If criminalization is our only resort, then we will never see the end to violence.  , 2 I wonder what GOP congressmen order when the gun lobby reps take them out to dinner., 2 Until someone actually commits a crime or exhibits behavior worthy of psychiatric committment, what do red flags really matter? In our current free society, we really couldnt' stop him. We can't jail someone because they seem unhinged or a threat. You can jail someone because someone called an FBI tip line and was worried. I suppose those things could trigger law enforcement surveilance but outside of terrorist threats civil rights laws make that difficult too.  Mental health discussion is valuable, yes, but that is much larger problem with an expensive and very long term solution. The only low hanging fruit in this discussion is how easy it is for deranged people to get assault rifles. , 2 We need to keep in mind that many Republican politicians receive huge payouts from the NRA.  Marc Rubio has received over the years $3,303,355 from the NRA according to reliable sources, and dot has received $30 Million from the same organization.  The amount \"donated\" to Florida Governor Rick Scott is not on record, but the NRA gives him an \"A\" grade.  This would make a good project for an investigative journalist.\n\nDr. Conde's excellent comment is one that should be distributed to every church and school in the country because it sensibly and intelligently points to gun control as the most effective way to stem the horrible killing of American children.  Why would any civilian \"need\" an assault weapon?  Guns can be bought in this country as easily as a T-shirt or a cookpot or a book, and that is crazy., 2 The details of Mr. Cruz's situation can probably be repeated, with some variations, thousands of times across the United States. As a child I heard about classmates who tortured animals or were \"off\" in other ways. The difference now, and the one constant in so many mass shootings, is the ready availability of AR15 killing machines.   , 2 I don't think anyone with sense would pick up on the professional school shooter post. The way it was worded sounds distinctly ironic, not serious. A \"professional\" school shooter? Sounds rather sardonic and a bit witty, not threatening. That's why this could never be prevented. As long as guns are available, they will be used. The studies show without any doubt. Beyond any doubt. The more guns the more gun violence. Let's get rid of all guns and get on with leading productive lives. , 2 Please more information about the unfortunate victims and their families. We don\u2019t need to provide any platforms for the murderers. Nothing is going to change in Washington. How many of their constituents (including kids) need to die before they tightened the US gun regulations? They are the part of the problem. And that is obvious., 2 It appears that a number institutions and individuals did the right thing.   Expelling him from the school seems like a prudent choice.  The family taking him in did a risky and noble thing.  While I would not tolerate a gun in my house, I assume that guns are more prevalent in that region, and perhaps keeping it in a locked box was the best they could negotiate.  Even if the FBI and law enforcement had been more proactive, we have seen that sometimes it is easy only in retrospect to distinguish between those who are disturbed and those who are dangerous.  \n\nIf he had lived in another country, he might have also gone on a bloody rampage.  But in any other developed country, he would not have had access to a gun and his rampage would have most likely been limited to using a knife, which would have drastically reduced the severity of the harm and the number of people affected.\n\nIt's about the guns.  The NRA will not allow the GOP to negotiate on any of this.  The first act of the GOP Congress in 2017 was to roll back restrictions on gun access for those people with mental health issues.  We will never get effective gun regulation in this country until the NRA-owned bizarrely-extremist Republican Party is defeated and relegated to the status of a small fringe party.  They must be defeated., 2 The United States seems to have a disproportionate number of mentally unstable, aggrieved white men willing to commit mass murder. , 2        These are the young, desperately torn from reality...for whatever reason...they are children America has lt play dress-up in combat fatigues, longcoats, ammunition and weapons. Malcom Gladwell's essay in the NewYorker well describes a type of normalization of these behaviors with an analogy to the participants in riots. A worthwhile read as it describes a current running under American life where nature or nuture isn't really the question.\n      Clearly, (if you look hard at the statistics) ANYONE in America, who does not drop everything NOW and march on Washington,occupying the halls of power to stop the NRA NOW, is suffering some kind of mental delusional disorder.\n     Stroke victims regain their faculties through finding new pathways to process movement. America get woke, march on Washington, cause a stroke.\nRise up!, 2 now that he has admitted the crime, turn him over to the families of the dead and wounded.\n\nlet them deal with him. no charges will be filed against them., 2 It\u2019s about the guns, 2 There is #MeToo movement for sexual assaults.\nWhere is #NoMoreGunViolence for assaults to our right to live?, 2 The NRA, conservative pundits, and Republicans everywhere tell us that \"guns make us safer.\"  Really?  Try bringing one into the halls of Congress or the White House.  The hypocrisy carries quite a stench., 2 It looks like he is wearing a red MAGA (make America great again) cap in one of the videos of him shooting a pistol in his backyard. On one of his social media sites he is definitely wearing one as he hides his face behind a camouflage bandanna. \n\nMAGA   Making Assault Guns Available... Wear this cap to show your support of the Republican state and federal legislators who keep these guns available in your neighborhood. 5,000,000 assault weapons, toys for the boys and their numbers are growing!, 2 The diversion of mental health insults the victims' families and our intelligence. No other country with strict gun regulations experiences our levels of violence. The guns are the problem, and the solution requires taking them away. Yes, taking them away from legal owners, too. Yes, this includes handguns as well as rifles. It's the guns, stupid., 2 The sub-headline here reads--\"he certainly had a difficult childhood.\"\nHow many people can we say that of?\nDickens based a whole literary career on characters with gruesome childhoods.\nThey didn't shoot randomly in schools with assault rifles.\nGun control....ah, no, that would interfere with \"freedom.\"\nAnd interfere with profits for gun makers.  Can't have that.\nFreedom to own guns is more important to us than safety of our children and of\nall of us.  I said that in a comment  here after one of the other mass shootings.\nHere we go again.\nYesterday's Opinion writer said it--\"we just don't care.\"  As a society, we just don't care.  As long as we have cheetos and booze and football and new cars and porn., 2 The problem is that when armed white dudes are near schools police rarely noticed them. Where I live in DC, police routinely report arresting armed black dudes all the time - and nobody really feel threatened by that anymore. But one day a deranged armed white dude appeared at my school (the GW)'s library without police noticing him until he was already inside the building. I was one of the librarians there and I called the UPD - took them another 5 minutes to come. Make no mistake, armed white dudes being near schools are very bad news. But nobody is interested in stopping or arresting them before they show up inside a school. Police only stalk around black dudes. This is our society's inherent problem: racial bias. And this is the price we are still paying for it, everyday., 2 Florida voted for TRUMP and NRA.\n\nFLORIDIANS love their guns!, 2 No civilian teenager should ever be able to get their hands on an assault rifle.  , 2 I wonder if the NR Times can help me determine which of the following phrases are most used by our president, senators, and representatives:\n1. \"Our father that art in heaven\"\n2. \"I pledge allegiance to the flag\"\n3. \"my thoughts and prayers gout to the victims\"\n4. \"this is not the time to talk about gun control\"\n5. \"this is a mental health issue\"\n\nPerhaps this would be a good topic for David Brooks to address in a column., 2 \" ENOUGH SAID\".....\" He said that Mr. Cruz at one point had gone to a school for students with special needs. \u201cKids were really picking on him and would gang up on him and beat him up a little,\u201d Mr. Gold said. \u201cThey ostracized him. He didn\u2019t have many friends.\u201d, 2 So--breaking news as I type--the FBI received information so starkly clear that a kindergartner could have comprehended it--and yet again they fumbled it like an amoeba trying to play football.\n\nSorry.  Maybe we should give the billions spent on law enforcement and counterintelligence to high school squads across the nation.  I think they*d be more than capable of doing the job.\n\nYeah--semi-automatics are a real problem in the hands of anyone, much less a congenitally-damaged, reported-to-be autistic kid who*d been terrorizing the neighbors for years.\n\nAnd==you hate the NRA?  Me too.  I also despise the *advocates* for the mentally ill who conveniently overlook the reality that most people who are mentally ill do not receive even a formal diagnosis, much less effective treatment.  Everyone plays with statistics to obscure truth.  \n\nAdam Lanza was autistic.  The kid in Oregon--or was it Washington State?--was autistic.  Dylann Roof is autistic.  This kid is autistic.\n\nAnd none of them received the services they needed to at least keep them and everyone else safe.  These kids weren't evil.  They were, or are, profoundly damaged in ways that were apparent from earliest childhood.  And all of their parents failed them first., 2 A 19 year old is not a \"child\", Mr Finkelstein. The  People of Florida have every right to ask the judge and jury to execute him. The current problems of the relatives of more than 30 families far outweigh any requirement the state had to consider the delicate feelings of this vicious perpetrator.  When will we ever care 1% as much for the victims and their families as for the authors of these atrocities?, 2 This is a mental health issue.  Centred squarely in the Oval Office., 2 Protecting American children from being murdered by military grade weapons is a medical problem, one which will only be solved by physicians.\n\nOur politicians lack the ability to resist the NRA's flow of campaign contributions.\n\nWhen military assault rifles, clips, and bullets are confiscated and outlawed,\nthen mentally ill patients will be unable to get their hands on them.\n\nPeriod.\n\nThe only thing that Paul Ryan and his NRA puppets have to offer America:\n\nineptitude., 2 \"...we should arm EVERY teacher.\"\n\nYou two faced, double talking sycophants don't even want to properly fund schools with pencils and printer ink. But now have the budget for Glocks? , 2 \"shooting weapons was a big part of the trip's allure\"\nBig surprise when boys whose brains are still forming, go out and kill?, 2 I am a gun owner. I like to go hunting. However I am all for making the AR-15 illegal. Truthfully my shotgun is more dangerous a weapon in the wrong hands though. One other law I am completely in favor is that if you get kicked out of school for  threatening other students you can\u2019t buy a gun for a number of years. I don\u2019t see how that would be objectable. , 2 Military style weapons in the hands of the criminally insane. Why is this allowed to happen?, 2 If your child grows up to the age of 19 and becomes a mass murderer I can't listen to excuses about the parents.  , 2 I'd like to report someone for \"bad and erratic behavior\".  He does nothing to protect Americans from guns, hatred, environmental destruction, corruption, and foreign tampering of our elections; while raiding the pockets of working people to pay the ultra rich more money.  He is destroying our government as we have known it since it's inception and loading the courts with people who think like he does so that there will be no way to legally challenge him and his cartel of buffoons.  We need politicians who are respected and teach our children not to hate by example.  Someone please listen., 2 (start sarcasm)\nI don't understand....they say it's not the gun; that a killer will find a way to kill. Why do they always seem to choose guns though?, 2 Grieving parents of Lakeland, be forewarned.  Trump will inevitably make this about him, the way he fought with the families of Sergeants Khan and Johnson and disrespected their sacrifices.  Embrace him at your own risk, knowing that if you somehow rub him the wrong way, he will unleash a Twitter storm on your family, and the memory of your child., 2 How can a 19 year old, with a job at the Dollar Store and no parents, afford an AR-15?  And all those other guns?\n\nAre they that cheap?  Can kids get a part-time summer job and buy weapons of mass death?\n\nSince the responsible gun owners refuse any kind of reform maybe we should add a mass death tax on every gun sale- make them very, very expensive., 2 Trump and and his party made it a legislative priority early in his term to roll back an Obama directive that would have made it harder for mentally ill people to buy guns.  Trump has also proposed large cuts to our already-inadequate mental health programs.  The NRA is allowed to critique and bat away \u201cflawed\u201d proposals (all proposals) to contain the carnage, as if they are in charge (they are, so it\u2019s not misleading). Why can\u2019t the hunters and self-defense gun owners get together with the rest of us so we can ban automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and any conversion kits? Don\u2019t they love their children too?, 2 Apparently, we have to put guns to the heads of our state and federal legislators before they get the message that enough is enough. Way more than enough. Let\u2019s try it. And yes, it\u2019s come to that. , 2 If money is the hold that the NRA has over individual politicians, would it be possible to form a citizen's group that could collect money from citizens and outbid the NRA?  Of course, it would be dangerous for anyone trying to organize this., 2 Why is no one talking about the bill the republicans are trying and will pass that states that every one should be able to carry a gun into to every state even those states that have tough restriction and /or do not have open carry laws. It just keeps getting worse and worse with these sorry Republicans., 2 Each time I EXIT Airport Security I feel a little chill of apprehension : \u201cNow I\u2019m back in the free-fire zone where anything can happen, anywhere, anytime\u201d.  Are we going to make illegal the ownership of weapons made to kill people, or are we going to install security gates at the entrance to every school, every church, every shopping mall, every concert, every civic gathering ?  If so why are we spending billions and billions abroad every year to protect such a way of life ? One doesn\u2019t need to even look up the statistics to know that one is many times more likely to be harmed or killed going about one\u2019s ordinary life by a fellow American with a gun than by a foreign terrorist. It is time to Make America Safe Again. Greatness might come later., 2 Republicans keep saying this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. So, if Nikolas Cruz has mental health problems, then legally speaking he shouldn't be going to jail for his crime. If he is convicted to go to jail, then it automatically becomes a Gun issue. , 2 Yes, this is a mental health issue.\nIt is a cultural health issue as well.\n\nNamely, the mental illness and cultural depravity and cowardice of any congressperson or president, current or former, enabling this slaughter to continue, year after horrific year.\n\nThis may be a cliche, but it applies: The blood of children is absolutely on their hands.\nWhat do we, the electorate, plan to do about it?, 2 The blame is to a) Hollywood and its bloody violence, where firearms play oh-so-engaging \"creative action\" rule along with river of blood 2) The same about TV production 3) The same about video games 4) All this supplemented by hourd of free, local and national TV broadcast with\"hard working\" reporters and talking heads inevitably speculating about \"motives\".\n\nCopycat phenomena + media desperate hunger for getting eyeballs to survive in increasingly brutal media fight for survival and advertising revenues are, after the foundation for \"action\" was for years, since these perpetrators' childhood cultivated by the mentioned Hollywood/TV/video games industrial complex \"finishing off\" the process.\n\nWhile Hollywood moguls etc. are still telling us that their violent production is not an \"inspiration\" to these criminals, copycat is rear and mortally dangerous. Look at islamic terrorists: One uses a car to kill people .... then others are \"inspired\" and follow such example., 2 One might be able to suggest mental illness as the underpinning of THIS event, but what about the Las Vegas shooter?  Everyone says he was \"normal\".  What about the HUNDREDS of other mass shootings in the past year?  DON'T FALL FOR THIS DIVERSION! \n\nHow about if it were simply not possible to buy a weapon of mass destruction of human life? , 2 Gun control? I think the genie is out of the bottle and it's not going back anytime soon. The right to self-defense including armed self-defense is clearly bedrock. As someone who was shot in an attempted holdup I can personally attest to that. The AR-15? What does that have to do with self-defense? Short of civil war or the equivalent - not much. The idea of hunting anything other than people with an AR-15 is absurd. \n\nIf you are talking home defense a shot gun or even a pistol is much more effective so that argument is bogus. There are now millions of AR-15 and AK-47 style rifles in the population so good luck with withdrawing that dimension of the mass shootings problem.\n\nMental health? Mental health begins 99% of the time with social conditions and as long as we remain in a society that is cutting, not expanding, resources to address career training and jobs, poverty, education, housing, health care, etc. you are not talking about anything more than feel good bandages and window dressing. \n\nTalk about fake news? How about fake discussions, fake policies, fake politicians, and fake sentiments. The American people have a corrupt and incompetent government they definitely do not deserve. And that includes the current administration in spades.\n\nThe time to feel sorry is not after an innocent has been senselessly murdered but before. Get real people., 2 If gun owners were required to carry liability insurance for their guns, much of the danger would be eliminated.  Who would provide insurance for an AR-15 for a 19 year old with mental problems? , 2 There is a way to stop this type of violence without banning assault rifles.\nFirst of all, no one in this country can tell me they went through grade school/high school without being bullied or at least witnessed a classmate being bullied.\nThe fact is, school age children are the meanest creatures on the planet when comes to social interaction with their piers. In order to better understand, we need to look at the animal world.\nMuch like a pack of timber wolves, when wolf pups are born and enter into pack, they need to establish their ranking in that pack by fighting. Our school children are no different with the exception that humans have feelings, don't soon forget, and unfortunately some hold a grudge for a long time.\nAwareness is the answer.\nMake it mandatory that all students take an anti-bullying class every year. Not only to deter the student that may become the bully but more importantly the students that stand by and watch or even worse, stand by and laugh.\nMake those \"stand by\" students realize that allowing the humiliation of someone in front of their classmates could lead to the end of their lives. Teach them to speak up and report bullying instead of doing nothing. Teach them that just standing by and laughing will make them look as mean as the bully in the eyes of the abused student and is why an entire school becomes a target.\nMake them realize that even making plans for a school shooting will result in attempted murder charges., 2 Interesting how someone cannot buy alcohol, but can buy a semi-automatic assault rifle. Reminds me of those days when people could not legally vote, but could legally and actively be sent to kill people with fully automatic assault rifles. All of this shows a sick society. A society grounded in security the interests of a few (the capitalist class) before the masses. Profiteers before the people. About gun control, there are those who say gun laws won't stop someone bent on acquiring a gun and using it. Ergo: gun laws don't work so why work to strengthen them. These voices fail to extend that logic to tax laws and almost any other law on the books, including traffic laws. If anyone believes tax laws stop tax cheats or traffic laws stop speeders they're either naive or disingenuous. And yet this country vigorously enforces--and tightens--both--and other laws broken daily for centuries! The question pivots on the fact that laws that bring in revenue (taxes, traffic, etc) are laws that escape the logic of the \"won't work\" crowd. There is an economy at work here--and a political economy that keeps structures in place. Sadly., 2 Blaiming the creeniong processes or the mental health system is a red herring, a distraction from the real causes and issues.   We won't cure mental illness and we don't want to pay for it.   Mr. Cruz would have only qualified for Medicaid or ACA and we know where the Country seems to stand with that.   Blaming others for failing to recognise and deal with the young man's issues is ridiculous.   I recall how difficult it was to get my elderly mother to stop driving.   We do not have the expertise or mechanisms in place for the FBI to keep track of all of us (thank goodness)., 2 Perhaps we need to establish the \"Mental Health\" police to seek out deranged people like Cruz.  Bottom line, we have had mass killings with 9mm handguns so banning assault rifles isn't the answer.  Until we reinforce background checks on all gun buyers and stop gun show sales, etc. we will continue to have mass shootings.  The NRA should be charged with every gun-related death that is enabled by their buying politicians and blocking sane gun legislation., 2 This assault weapon was legally purchased from a gun shop. Aren't there records of his name and registration for that AR-15?? I do not understand why the FBI would not have been able to track him down if he had purchased the weapon before making the YouTube post. He used the exact spelling of his name on the post. How many people with that name purchased a weapon, particularly an AR-15 that is used in mass murders, in the previous 24 months? Did the FBI check that? I can certainly understand the difficulty identifying him if he bought the AR-15 after making the post.\n\nNo one should be allowed to purchase a lethal weapon without confirmation that their name and registration was added to a national database.\n\nThere are more holes and missed opportunities here than just in the shooter's life. It seems we have a gun registry that is next to useless because of so many omissions and loopholes.  Florida allows 18 yr olds to buy assault weapons with no waiting period. The president rescinded regulations preventing those with various mental illnesses from buying guns. We have a culture promoted by the NRA and gun manufacturers that values profits and the proliferation of combat-style weapons over people's lives.\n\nIf we are not going to change the laws, every citizen who supports the NRA and those politicians who do nothing should be honest with themselves. They think the murder of children is an acceptable price to pay so they can have unfettered access to guns. , 2 A detailed analysis of the facts of every mass shooting since WW2 will almost certainly reveal conspicuous and distinctive patterns to guide intelligent gun safety planning and the adoption of legislation designed to save lives. Why have the GOP prevented groups like the NIH from doing this vital work?, 2 Not all is tragedy.\n\nWinners include Donald Trump who took more than $30 million in NRA contributions in the 2016 campaign, Marco Rubio, who has taken more than $3 million from the NRA over the years, and many other politicians -- a lot more than 30 pieces of silver., 2 Every red flag?  The key flag is that military weapons are available for sale to civilians., 2 Every red flag. Easily got an arsenal legally.\n\nThe problem is glaringly obvious., 2 Apart from the easy availability of guns, school  shootings and mass murders  have one common denominator that is always ignored by the press: SSRI antidepressant drugs. The FDA gives these drugs a \"black box\" warning- increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior, aggression and homicidal ideation, among many others.  A quick internet search of this topic  shows that the perpetrators of these acts were either on or recently  getting off these drugs. According to his aunt, N. Cruz was on these meds.  , 2 Everyone of these killers experiences, prior to their outburst, a moment of realization and acceptance. That is, they realize and accept that they are going to \"do it.\" It festers for a long time, but then something tips them over. And that's when they start accumulating the weapons. If there were a way of tracking that pattern -- like a gun registry or something like VINs on vehicles, then there might be a way of predicting where one of these men is about to explode. And I realize that many people are \"injured\" but I think it would be more accurate reporting to state how many people were actually shot rather than killed/injured. I don't know how many people the Las Vegas person shot, but it had to have been far more than he killed. And if you think about the fact that he could shoot upwards of 400 people in a few minutes, the scope of what's happening would be more accurate. , 2 Well here we go again. Another unthinkable tragedy that will somehow \u201cbring us together as a nation in this time of grief.\u201d We can try to sugarcoat this any way we want, but the fact is this was just a terrible event that could have been easily avoided through the use of stricter gun legislation. You can go on and on about Cruz\u2019s mental health issue and the fact that he showed signs for a very long time, but looking at it simply this was a 19 year old that was LEGALLY allowed to buy an assault rifle. The kid can\u2019t even enjoy a beer with his old man and yet he can takes steps to purchase a weapon capable of mass murder even with his long history of mental health issues. While these events might temporarily bring us together as a people, It is already clear that we will forget about this very soon. Just look at the Las Vegas shooting, or the Pulse Nightclub shooting: No one remembers these events and no one ever will unless we take action in government. Congress needs to stand up to the NRA and prevent a psychotic 19 year old from being able to buy a gun. It just makes too much sense., 2 It doesn't matter that the gunman has supposedly confessed. There are plenty of eyewitnesses to his actions. No doubt a sweep of his home, recent purchases and computer activity will be more than enough to secure a conviction. \n\nNow the Monday-morning quarterbacking can begin. \"Mr. Cruz had no criminal history before the shootings, according to state law enforcement records. But his childhood was certainly troubled.\"\n\n\"Troubled childhood\" could include such diverse figures as Winston Churchill and Jack London. Neither resorted to shooting schoolchildren.\n\nAnd there's the issue- most people who have \"troubled childhoods,\" or even diagnosed mental illness, are neither prone to violence nor otherwise the proper subject of law enforcement scrutiny.\n\nNow just suppose that the most lethal weapon this shooter could lay his hands on was a 5-shot rifle which required constant reloading. Would he have accepted the calculus of risk which would made him vulnerable to being disarmed every few seconds, and just stayed home? Would any of the recent mass shooters?\n\nThere's a reason no one chooses a bolt-action rifle or 6-shot revolver to commit mass murder. Is it possible the answer (or at least part of it) is sitting in plain sight, right under our noses?\n\nDarn right it is. Anyone who claims otherwise is a fool, or a bought-and-paid-for liar. Or, in the case of Trump, both., 2 Virtually all of these school shooters were on poorly administered doses of antidepressants.  Which in itself, is not their fault.  Obviously we shouldn't give insane people access to guns, but when we ask what kind of person would do this, the answer really is, nobody would do this; it is a side effect of poorly monitored medications prescribed by a doctor.  See if I am right.  Sandy Hook, Columbine, the Joker killer, Virginia Tech shooter, this.  I didn't make this up; it is freely available information.  The unique factor here was not guns; it was a unique derangement precipitated by drugs, creating, or potentiating, homicidal thoughts.  These sorts of killings will continue, with, or without guns., 2 This is not about mental health or even guns, per se, it is about a specific type of gun; the AR-15.  A military weapon loaded designed so that 1 bullet equals 1 kill.  They had been banned, but the ban ended during the Bush Administration and was never renewed by our bought and sold Congress.  I wonder if there is a correlation between the ban/no ban and mass killings?\nOne guy brings a shoe bomb on a plane and we turn air travel upside down, while mass killings become almost routine and no action is taken, what a country!, 2 My mother was born on a farm in rural Iowa in 1918. Her father kept a loaded shotgun on the front porch of their unlocked house- no one locked their houses- so he could grab it easily if a fox got into the hen house. To her knowledge, no person in Buena Vista County was murdered with a firearm until at least the 1960s. Obviously, it is a completely different world that we live in now. Leaving a loaded shotgun on the porch is not only illegal but it would be crazy to do so. So we don't leave the shotgun on the porch (although many guns are easily accessible in many homes), but we allow people- even minors and even those on terrorist watch lists- to buy them, legally or illegally, because this is their right under the Second Amendment? Uh, no. They are NOT keeping firearms as part of a well-regulated militia. We can no longer live in a world where the Second Amendment is used as justification for allowing anyone with homicidal tendencies to get a gun. And no one outside of military and law enforcement personnel needs to have an automatic weapon. You don't hunt deer with an AR-15. You only use them to kill people. Let's stop gun deaths in our homes, our schools, our churches, our communities. How many more people have to die because the NRA pretends it is still 1918, not 2018? And how many gutless, amoral politicians will continue to go to the NRA trough despite the never-ending carnage?, 2 There are commenters that say middle schoolers and high schoolers who exhibit anti-social behavior should be red-flagged.\n\nOn the surface, most would say \"OK\". \n\nBut then remember, these kids also belong to parents who scream, rant, and cause scenes at these kids' Little League coaches, and scream at teachers and principals when their kids are called out for being unruly. Or if their kids get a C instead of an automatic A+, the helicopter parents swoop in and demand the teacher be fired. \n\nHow many times have we seen on TV news vicious fights occurring on school busses on the bus cameras? Then parents of those same kids in the fights DENYING  it was their own kid on camera? \n\nThat being said, there are kids who are true sociopaths and headed for a life of crime. Teachers, principals, and the other kids know who they are.\n\nAn FBI that ignores these reports doesn't help. , 2 Acting as though mental illness is the problem is just plain immoral. Every country has some children with such problems; not every country has epidemic mass shootings. It's utterly horrendous that we don't have better social supports for a mentally unstable teenager who is orphaned, but that's not the real issue, either. The problem is too many guns. We need to take a page from Australia's book and organize a giant national gun buy-back program, because ANY reduction in the number of weapons loose in our society would be helpful. And we need much smarter gun control laws., 2 The issue isn't that the shooter \"showed every red flag.\"  Society will always contain such individuals.  The issue is that he had easy access to weapons of mass destruction.  Focusing in on the individual perpetrator, his history, mental status, wrong turns, missed signals puts the emphasis in the wrong area.  It's about access to military grade weapons of mass murder and nothing else., 2 Ralph Nader took on GM (Chevrolet) via \"Unsafe At Any Speed --Chevrolet Corvair-- and won.  A product that was killing and injuring people was removed from the marketplace.\n\nThe question is: why is our Ralph Nader today and in these past years to take on the AR 15.  Why is it not removed from manufacture and from the marketplace?  If only the military and Law Enforcement need M16s and heavy duty industrial strength weapons, then why are \"lighter-weight\" guns such as the AR15 even allowed to be made in America or elsewhere?  Why are they allowed to be imported, brought into the country legally or otherwise? The AR15 cannot even be considered a \"sporting gun\" or \"sporting rifle.\"  Any hunted creature has no sporting chance against it.\n\nI will admit that I don't know who makes these AR15s, but in America they should be prohibited and banned from doing so and their factories and assembly lines shut, melted down, destroyed and demolished.  Where is Ralph or someone like him when we need him!?    , 2 Please stop it with the \"repeal\" comments.  Look up how difficult it is to repeal or add a constitutional amendment.  Magazine limits, licensing, wait periods, background checks, etc are all much more reasonable (and still near impossible to pass!).\nThere are many Democrats, including Bernie Sanders and people in Minnesota who support guns so don't blame \"the GOP\" all the time.\nHow do you \"ban high powered assault rifles?\"  - write the law for me so I can see it (and get around it).  , 2 To focus only on mental health or to suggest the schools should be \"like gated communities\" (by the way, we shouldn't NEED gated communities) as the total solutions is naive and unproductive and just excuses. I would like to see Mr. Ryan and the NRA actually back a proposal that anyone showing a \"red flag\" should be unable to buy or possess guns and explain how they would accomplish such a thing. And please explain away, if you will, the correlation of the number of guns in our country with the number of mass shootings compared to other countries--it must be that we are 10 times as mentally ill as the rest of the world . . ., 2 Dear Floridians, our fellow Americans, our hearts weep for you.  But there is only so much the rest of us can do to keep this from happening again in your state.  The laws of Florida, passed by men you elected, have made it ludicrously easy for anyone to obtain and own a weapon of war.  This man could have owned a thousand of these guns and he would not give law enforcement any right to detain him.  You have the power to change the laws within your own state.  Find out who is responsible and take their jobs.  Start with Rick Scott., 2 At no point in this article is there mention of Mr. Cruz having received any mental health services. His history of serious acting-out behaviors was known to the school. Was he ever referred to the child study team?. For this already troubled, psychologically fragile young man, the death of his parents and expulsion from school were double major loses. This made him ripe for total loss of self-control. The school's apparent neglect of his serious acting-out behaviors and easy access to guns have resulted in this horrible tragedy. Unfortunately, we have now established a tradition of school-based violence that will continue due unrestricted gun use. , 2 This article reports that the confessed shooter had a brother who had been adopted with him. Where is the brother now that both parents are dead?  If his mother had been Nicholas' mainstay, as reported, had there been any provisions made within a larger Cruz family for looking into what would happen to either of the two boys should anything happen to their mother?What real oversight of Nicholas was taken by the Snead family?  Is a lack of oversight or mentoring of Nicholas a reason for the family retaining a lawyer?  If Nicholas is diagnosed as autistic that might be part of a defense against execution., 2 \"He posted pictures of weapons and dead animals on social media\" - This is considered as a red flag (and I agree with it), but how is it different than these so-called \"big game hunters\" who do the same? Isn't that equally sick?\nI think as a society we have a lot to introspect and look into if we take pride in such things. One is labelled as mental illness after the crime while other is labelled as sportsmanship., 2 With everyone else I am very troubled by this shooting spree.  Nickolas was indeed disturbed and seemingly mentally ill.  But his action seems to be motivated by a non pathological syndrome, the desire for revenge.  Nickolas endured \"the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\" the death of his parents and the bullying of his peers.  To end them he opposed them, not by taking his own life (he had not despaired of life) but by sending a \"valentine\" to his imagined tormentors.  I think it is significant that he told his foster mother that he did not go to school on Valentine's Day.  Nickolas is not a monster.  He is a tormented adolescent who directed his developed combat oriented energies at a mentally undeveloped symbolic target.\n\nIt is a tragedy., 2 The NRA and the Republican Congress will wait this one out just as they've done the others. They know that's all they have to do before it's back to business as usual. After Sandy Hook, I thought that maybe, just maybe, someone, anyone, in Congress would do the right thing. But they didn't.\nOne Parkland student said, My generation won't stand for this.\nSo my hope lies with future generations. Until then, many, many more people will die in mass shootings., 2 There is no legitimate reason to own an AR-15. In the hands of any civilian, it is nothing but a weapon to commit mass murder. Some may feel nothing can be done about the gun problem in America. They may be right. But I think there is something anyone, everyone can do starting today. You know somebody obsessed with guns, somebody who makes threats, somebody overwhelmed with hate? Then tell the authorities. There is no legitimate reason for anyone but law enforcement and the military to own an AR-15., 2 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) is a U.S. law that protects firearm manufacturers & dealers from being held liable when crimes have been committed by their products. This law should be rewritten to allow the victims of mass shooters to sue the provider of military grade weapons. , 2 The only steps trump, scott and the others who are in the pocket of the NRA will take to make schools \"safer\" is to arm teachers and administrators.  They want more guns not fewer.  Yet, they are careful never to permit guns in legislative and court buildings.  Think you could walk into the white house with an AR-15? or scott's office? Or paul ryan's or mitch mcconnell's?  Not a chance.  Why not?They are afraid as they should be.  Guns are dangerous. But they are cowards and are afraid of the NRA.\n\nThe various gun safety groups (Moms Demand Action, Brady Campaign, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,Everytown for Gun Safety, etc.) should focus on high school students for support and help register them to vote because they can help throw out the feckless legislators and elected officials who refuse to protect us., 2 \"Black Panther\" is a great cultural film! Hollywood has been the candy store of all things bad for American mental health. With the demise of the family and women more interested in daycare than raising children the result is a society ruled by commercial gratification.\nThere is no silver bullet to stop school shootings only a signal that we better change our national priorities. Our resources should be spent on our people not war., 2 Look at this picture. Who is the legal defender for this young man? A woman and a mother. I don't know how she came to be his defense attorney. Regardless, she is a professional doing a job, under our constitution and system of laws, providing the legal defense every accused is entitled to. But the picture says so much more to me. That troubled young man is the product of a masculinity culture women are complicit in but not in control of. Women just pick up the broken lives of the young men with guns and their victims.  Can we talk about why that is? Can we change that?, 2 Most people with mental health problems do not commit violent acts.  They are more likely to be victims.  Yes, we need better mental health care in this country, but this isn't why.  \n\nI was a prison psychologist for over 20 years.  I know a bit about violent people.  Yes, I could offer a pretty good guess of who might be more likely to commit a violent act (inmate OR staff, unfortunately), but I wouldn't bet money on when.  Next week?  Next year?  No idea.  Unless the person was in an immediate psychotic crisis, and obviously an imminent danger to self or others, I couldn't predict the future.  In fact, I can't rule out a violent outburst from ANYONE with 100% accuracy.  So, unless you want to proactively lock up people who haven't done anything yet, I can't help you.  \n\nHere's a better idea.  Since we can never be certain who might go on a murderous rampage, or when ... let's not let ANYONE have access to weapons that are designed to kill multiple victims as quickly as possible.  I'd much rather deal with a murderous rampage from a person armed with a baseball bat.  Wouldn't you?, 2 There is no market or government solution to this problem in the USA.\n\nThus: we need a design solution.   Schools need metal detectors and classrooms need to be shut down and bullet proofed.   There needs to be police in the halls when the change classes.  There needs to be a guarded perimeter around the school that needs to be policed and only people with the appropriate ID can enter.   Private schools can differentiate themselves by the degree of safety they offer.\n\nSound terrible and expensive and extreme?   Given there is no market or government solution in the USA...what is left?  What is your idea?, 2 The key question is how a 19 year old boy with no parents was able to buy a semi-automatic rifle.  This has nothing to do with Second Amendment rights. It has everything to do with the powerful gun lobby that puts weapon sales and profits above the lives of children., 2 We need tighter regulations and better controls on guns, their types and uses.  We don't need politicians and gun lovers with more of their same excuses to justify weapons in the hands of ordinary citizens.  Guns have but one purpose and that is to kill a life.\n\nWe've heard over the past few days many Republicans talking about their prayers.  Are the prayers truly for the victims or are they so Republicans don't lose their NRA ratings and funding?, 2 The head of the snake is the military style weapon.\nIt should be first to be denied to all citizens in the\nCommon Good. The AR and Glock types are too\nattractive, too, almost anonymously, powerful for\nparanoids and unhappy people to resist in their\ndesire for revenge. We can work on mental health,\ncultural issues AFTER we eliminate assault rifles\nand semi-auto pistols from the public, by confiscation,\nbuy-out, whatever. And be able to prosecute and jail\nanyone with one of these guns in their possession,\nno excuses. Revolvers should be registered.They can too\neasily be carried and concealed. Shotguns and rifles, bolt action, lever action, double barrel can be used as weapons, but are not a romance for the sickos. And they do less damage in a short period of time.\n\nCitizens do not need military style weapons. Paranoids\ndo. Get rid of both by banning these weapons.  It's a\nstrong start.  No more palaver about mental health, etc.\nThat can come later., 2 It is very disheartening and discouraging to hear our so-called leaders making the same pronouncements of how they are going to do everything they can to make sure this kind of tragedy does not happen again.  Then you have a president who is opposed to any gun control measures - he wants tont shift the focus on mental illness.  How convenient to appease the NRA.  Until the politicians find members of their family victims of this kind of tragedy, they will continue to feed us lip service.\n\nHow does a 19-year old kid procure weapons is incredulous?  It's bad enough our society is populated with its share of troubled, broken and dysfunctional families struggling to survive, let alone adding fuel to the fire by making weapons of death so readillly available., 2 It's not my job to keep the people in my community under surveillance so my congressional representatives can continue to receive their generous \"contributions\" from the NRA.\n\nIt's not my job to evaluate the mental health of my neighbors on Facebook and Instagram to facilitate America's obscene obsession with guns. \n\nThis isn't a \"mental health\" problem. This is quite simply a too many guns problem. Period., 2 If Congress and state legislatures won't implement reasonable gun control measures we should demand that they heavily tax every aspect of gun ownership -- including raising the sales taxes on guns and ammo, registration fees to sell guns, and application fees to own a gun and require anyone who buys or sells guns to take out liability insurance. The proceeds fro the taxes and fees can fund research into those mental health problems that supposedly are the source of the problem. Tax gun violence to death before it kills more innocent people. \n\nOh, and the NRA should be shamed into donating to mental health organizations in amounts equal to the money they donate to political campaigns., 2 I don't see any hope until the NRA decides that there is too much killing by automatic weapons and the gun manufactures have a change of heart.\nFor years there was terrible killing in Ireland until the parties got tired of it. We can work and try to elect people who are responsible but wouldn't it be wonderful if the NRA came out and said your children did not die in vain. We support the banning of automatic weapons as a tribute to you children., 2 \"And other factors contribute to mass shootings, such as the availability of guns and the degree to which media coverage turns mass shooters into celebrities.\"\n\nA quote from another New York Times article published today. This entire article turns Nikolas Cruz into a celebrity, justifies his actions with his troubled childhood, and ends by suggesting that if he had only \"blended in\" more with his classmates, none of this would have happened. Hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people in this country have had difficult childhoods. Many people do not feel like they fit in during middle school and high school. Murdering children should not be seen as a response to these challenges for the many others who have faced similar circumstances (or far worse). This young man should have faded into obscurity, his name never mentioned and never put on a pedestal. This article shouldn't have been written. Follow your own advice and stop turning mass shooters into celebrities. , 2 Clearly, this young man was seriously ill and needed help, which he apparently didn't receive. That said, one wonders what the FBI was doing, if anything, after having been warned of Mr. Cruz's behavior. But the real bottom line is: why are guns so readily av available in the United States? No other country on earth is so incredibly lax regarding gun ownership. But then, I suppose we can sum all of this up in two words: The NRA. It has bought members of Congress, who will continue to do nothing to stop gun violence in this country so long as they are supported by this insidious lobby. So, can the next school or other mass shooting be far away? Of course not., 2 The issue of guns whether it's gun safety or gun control needs to be the central theme, front and center, in this midterm election. Any candidate accepting money from the NRA must be publicize. Every candidate must concisely express their position on the issue. The American voters must demand these answers or we will be in the same position again. We must do it for our children. Our children!, 2 What on earth are we going to do about this?\n\n1.  Cruz is said to be autistic.  He was presumably an exceptional student ed student.  Broward is an excellent school district in dealing with such students.  But he eventually was too much for Broward, so they expelled him.\n\n2.  Cruz had minor brushes with law enforcement.  So far, it doesn't seem to have been enough to cause incarceration or other serious intervention.  \n\n3.  Cruz lost his parents, but he was adopted.  From all accounts, his adoptive parents did all that they reasonably could to help guide him.\n\n4.  Cruz may or may not be mentally ill. From all appearances, he may be mentally handicapped.  There is a difference.\n\nSo, what's left?  Gun control.  There are too many guns.  Start with a restoration of the 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons.  Then ban handguns.  No one hunts with them.  Impose a quote on personal ownership of other guns.  Require owners to present their guns every two years for certification.  And no grandfathering in.  \n\nAnd, on a personal level, boycott all films and video games that include guns.\n\nEnough is enough., 2 Despite Trump's tweet where he blames Cruz's friends and neighbors and claims these people, some who are victims of the shooting, should have done more, the fact is that Cruz was repeatedly reported.\n\nHe was reported to the police numerous time, he was reported to the FBI, the school was aware of him, he was expelled from the school, etc.  Despite all of these reports it is still legal for him to go into a gun store and walk out with an AR 15 20 minutes later.  The problem is easy access to guns.  No one should be able to buy an AR 15, there should be longer wait periods, more comprehensive background checks (the Republican controlled Florida legislature was due to vote to make background checks o handguns less strict the day after this shooting).  , 2 The reason that it couldn't have been prevented?\n\nTerribly simple and a lesson for the future !\n\nEverybody was waiting for the 'system' to take care of the warning signs.\n\nNo one wanted 'to get involved'., 2 I did not hear Mr. Trump say how we would implement identification or treatment for the mental illness that he identifies as the primary cause of mass shootings. Who will pay for the testing and then treatment of those identified as dangerous? How many billions of dollars and from where, what form of nation-wide health insurance will become available to the entire US population? \n\nHe reassured our kids that any number of people will support them--but nowhere did he name any public servant or agency. I don't think he's serious about ending this rampage, do you?, 2 I worked with acting-out youth for almost 40 years, 32 of them as a special education teacher in behavioural/mental health programs for children & youth. Angry and upset youth will say and do some pretty outrageous things but in my experience exclusion (suspension or expulsion) should be the last and least desirable response to most infractions.\nInstead, we relied heavily on in-school restrictions: a student would have to work in a study carrel (which kept him in our room with his peers), recesses were spent in a very restricted area under constant supervision, backpack may be searched, etc. until some measure of trust was regained.\n\nCanadian share the same mental health difficulties as Americans. The major difference is that firearms are much more tightly controlled here. Assault-type weapons are prohibited. If Americans persist in allowing assault rifles they should at least have a mechanism for citizens to report worrisome behaviour by people who are known to be armed and a legal process for police to intervene.\nMany of our students were threatening to varying degrees. Parents, teachers, neighbours and especially peers invariably have first-hand observations about  teenagers. Police can be surprisingly creative and discreet in what they do with sensitive information. If a pattern of out-of-control behaviour can be demonstrated a judge may be empowered to intervene. Engaging with troubled youth is likely to be more productive than isolating them., 2 Let's not scapegoat those with mental illness.  The problem is not mental illness, but easy access to guns, and high-powered ones at that.  Yes, we must do much better in this country to provide resources for those who struggle with mental illness, but that is a separate (though important) issue from the necessity of gun control.  It is utter national insanity to subjugate ourselves to  the very profitable gun industry and  bend to the will of the NRA, which has gained huge power through lobbying and donations to elected officials and representatives.  Nikolas Cruz is simply another in a long line of violent men who mass murder.  Period.  He engaged in terroristic behavior that was premeditated. Period.  Lots of people suffer from mental illness. Lots of people suffer from loss.  But they  don't murder others.  In fact, those with mental illness are 6 times as likely to be victims of crimes as they are to be perpetrators.  We really know so little about mental illness and how to manage \"chemical treatment.\"  But we do know is that guns kill people. Period. And the statistics in the U.S. are devastating.  That's straight-forward.  I've never understood the American obsession with guns.  And no one needs to be armed like the military., 2 The more I think about the \"greatest country in the world\" narrative, the flag-waving, the nationalism, the more I realize that these displays are obviously desperate and often hollow attempts to deflect and obscure the endemic unhappiness, anger, and dysfunction of American society. The truly great countries (and this is equally true for individuals) never have to self-declare their greatness or demand oppressive nationalist conformity (think Colin Kaepernick -- and, crucially, why the \"taking a knee\" has had to re-brand itself as more patriotic than standing)., 2 In the past three years over FOUR HUNDRED people have been shot in schools.\nIn that time here has been a school shooting every month except one.\nThis is great news for gun manufacturers, as fear drives more people rush out to buy guns, which by definition means a larger number of them will being left out, stored unlocked, stolen, accidentally discharged, or as in this case deployed on children. Nowhere outside a war zone is there such a shockingly sanguine policy stance about the number of guns per capita.\nTime to wake up and hold the gun manufacturers accountable, but our legislators have drunk the Kool-aid of lobbying dollars., 2 Yes, a complicated story of one young man's life. Clearly, the adults in his life were trying to help him. There is only one thing I can fault these caring and concerned adults with: the AK-15. Why in the world would they allow him to keep it in their home? Why would they and other parents allow three teenage boys to take AK-15s on a trip to shoot for fun? Was that part of the culture that says boys need guns to \"make them men\"? Isn't that the problem we all need to confront, personally, in how we raise our boy children, in our movies and video games, in our over-the-top glorification of our military \"fighting men\"? We need to start now and over generations, a slow process, force the gun mythology into remission. The movement away from masculinity-equals-guns has to be led by men. Women can't do it. Women can say, \"No guns in my home.\" But that's all. Boys learn from men what it means to be a man. We still expect men to be the protectors of the family but how often, in this economy and society, are men present to protect their children and wives with their guns? Maybe a few hours between supper and breakfast, if that. No fathers with guns were in that school to protect their children. It's time to realize that guns don't protect our families, they threaten them. . , 2 There is only one red flag that matters. The suspect lived in a country where it is easy to legally purchase weapons designed specifically to kill as many people as possible as efficiently as possible. All other red flags are manageable., 2 My classroom is adjacent to the main entryway of our school. Every year I tell the parents of my students that not only will I instruct them, I will keep them safe from harm\n   Years ago my principal thought it unwise to say, to my parents, now after\nall of these shootings, the administrator knows like all teachers in this country\nthey may be asked to put their life on the line, 2 Words do have a meaning, always.\nBut we don;t always see it in its full spectrum.\nThe NRA and the gun lobby claim they do not agree with gun control.\nBut what does \"control\" mean?\nIs completely unchecked availability not a form of \"control\"?\nIf that is true, are we not talking about what KIND of control to have (free-for-all, or limited)?\nShould we then abolish all laws who prescribe any prohibition of action?\nDoes the NRA, in the final analysis, not demand lawlessness?, 2 Lots of comment re the NRA which is being pilloried whether justifiably or not for encouraging self sufficiency suitable to the 18th century.\n\nThe idea of gun ownership as a necessary fashion accoutrement has gained the traction it has thanks to our well bandaged heritage which covers a an ammo box of sins in the guise of freedom.\n\nI don't know the basis of a fascination which I, like countless other men, feel toward the works of deathly art, but I do know the first .22 I had was used to kill a bird for no other purpose than to show my mastery over nature. Nothing noble in that pursuit and I never \"hunted\" again. It was a sense of personal shame rather than morality which removed my great white hunter mask.\n\nTarget shooting like throwing darts and horseshoes requires concentration and the developement of motor skills.\n\nUsing a gun to hunt for food requires the same skillset. \n\nNo skill is needed to kill with an AR-15 and NRA members know this. , 2 Seems like America loves their guns more than their children. I hope to be proven wrong by some sensible gun safety legislation this time but I doubt it. No one is looking to take away all guns but addition gun safety protections are a public health necessity. Mothers Against Drunk Driving became a powerful force. We need something like this again. It's pretty obvious by their silence that Congress is entirely beholden to the gun lobby and won't make any substantive changes on their own. The mid-term elections can't come some enough. , 2 Looking at the 2016 FBI UCR the types of weapons used in murders are below. The last time that I looked at mass shootings handguns were used much more often than rifles, of which assault weapons are a subset. The data below reinforces that. If middle class people are just going to focus on mass shootings and ignore the almost 75% of firearm homicides that occur in low income urban neighborhoods it will amount to nothing less than another aspect of institutionalized racism. Focusing on assault weapons is the same as about 80% of firearm homicides are committed with handguns, primarily in those same neighborhoods. \n\nGun control advocates use a bait and switch by pointing at all firearm homicides but then primarily focusing on assault weapons, in then end not helping anyone, either the victims of mass shootings or all firearm homicides. The media has been driving the campaign on assault weapons; do yourself credit and apply rational skills and the use of data to come with some solutions to address firearm violence.  \n\n15070 Total\n11004 Total firearms:\n_7105 Handguns\n__374 Rifles\n__262 Shotguns\n__186 Other guns\n_3077 Firearms, type not stated\n_1604 Knives or cutting instruments\n__472 Blunt objects (clubs, hammers, etc.)\n__656 Personal weapons (hands, fists, feet, etc.)\n_1334 Other weapons, 2 The \"right,\" exemplified by Florida Governor Rick Scott, come up with statements like \"We have to find ways of limiting access to guns by the mentally ill.\"  Am I automatically on the \"left\" to suggest that the sentence should be kept intact but that the last four words can be eliminated?  I'm thinking automatic assault guns, not all guns; unfortunately, the prevailing attitude is that if we limit any type of guns, we're opening the door to ban all guns.  I urge everyone once more to look at how super-conservative Australian Prime Minister John Howard led the legislative reforms in his country thirty years ago to eliminate assault weapon ownership and use.  Australians otherwise still can have guns., 2 Trump's teleprompter speech is the Just Say No equivalent for school shooters. There are more than 15 MILLION high school students. How many are troubled, cause problems, even get expelled? Sure, call the police over and over on these problem students. Burden the system and spy on your neighbors. Sadly, Cruz could have hurt someone no matter who called whom, but without that gun, it would have been a lot fewer than 17 dead and many more injured., 2 This tragedy would have been averted by lower taxes on the rich, higher military spending, and the acquisition of another 1000 nuclear weapons. , 2 This is the price we all pay so that Americans can have easy access to guns. It is hard for me to believe that relatively unfettered gun ownership is so important for some people that they are willing to live with these tragedies that play out over and over. Yes, restricting access to assault weapons will put a crimp in Americans' Second Amendment rights but really, isn't that a small price to pay so that we are not killing our children?, 2 The facts of this case underscore the near impossibility of predicting who might commit such a crime. How many kids have problematic pasts yet never commit a crime, much less a crime like this? We simply do not have the mental health assessment tools to identify a killer before the fact. For this reason, we will never find mental health screening to be a satisfactory method of denying gun ownership. I'm not suggesting that it shouldn't be used; merely that that alone cannot prevent events like this.\n\nThe only sure way to end these mass killings is to remove the implements of destruction from everyone's hands. I cannot see why an AR-15-type weapon should be available to the general public. The gun simply has no valid reason for existence beyond a shooting spree. It's only a 22 caliber, too small to hunt big game with. They're not particularly accurate. Put a bump stock on it and you effectively have a fully-automatic machine gun. Let's get rid of them, period. They are no more justifiable than hand grenades, and they're not permitted., 2 I am a high school teacher, so saddened and sickened and disheartened that it's hard to go about \"business as usual\" today. Yesterday I offered a midday walk for teachers - just a short lap around the building - a mindful walk, if you will, to hold this tragedy in our hearts and send a message of protection to our students, but nobody came. They were too busy making copies and grading papers. And so we go on, comfortably numb. , 2 Assault weapons are designed to kill with maximum efficiency. I am completely at a loss to understand the need to have/own an assault weapon with large capacity magazines in this country. \n\nThe issue of mental health is a serious one. It is often difficult to identify or evaluate and is a matter of degree. There certainly needs to be an increased awareness, compassion and treatment for the mentally disturbed. But that is a slow process and it takes time to identify and certainly to correct.\n\nWhat is a clearer in attempting to mitigate the problem of mass shootings and violence, is the implementation of sensible gun safety laws to include the banning of assault weapons for civilians. It is an action that can be taken now and in the light of awareness. We don\u2019t need to wait to figure out who is stable or prone to disturbed actions.\n\nEnough is enough. It is well within our power to remove one of the major components of the tragedies caused by the combination of mental illness and guns! \n\nWe the people, can do this. It is outrageous not to., 2 So, there's this kid on one end and then the kids CNN has been interviewing in the other. Cruz is a disturbing mess but this school and those parents should be commended for raising the intelligent, well spoken, thoughtful young people who have been in front of the camera this week. We may be living in a pit now, but with what I've seen and heard this week, there is definitely hope. , 2 My father said that when he went to grade school and high school in the late 1920's to mid 1930's, some of the country kids took rifles to school, left them in the coat room, and shot dinner on their trek home.  All the farm people and most town people, including children, had easy access to one or more loaded firearms.  Guns were sold at the hardware store and dry goods store,  or could be obtained mail order vie the Sears or Montgomery Ward catalogue, no questions asked.  The grocery store sold ammunition.  Occasionally family and and other disputes, usually related to gambling or alcohol distribution,  ended in shootings, but mass killing were unheard of.\nAlmost 100 years on access to guns is more difficult, and yet we have mass shootings and major US inner cities (Chicago, Detroit, St Louis ...) are for all intents and purposes free fire no-go-zones where a holiday weekend body count overtakes that of even the most horrendous \"mass killings\".\nThe question that should be asked is why people have grown more savage in the last 3/4 century and if the process can be reversed., 2 What good is a tip from a citizen, if the FBI is too busy helping politicians to act?\n\nNew laws should be passed to make sure that the FBI does its job, and nothing else but its job.  All investigations of politicians should be excluded - that's the job of a free press., 2 One again it will business as usual after another horrendous school shooting. As most of these comments can attest to, those who are anti gun will stay the course and those who are pro second amendment will do the same. To say that the focus on mental health is wrong (as previously posted) shows a bias that is equally matched by those who refuse to admit that stricter gun laws are needed.\nThe problem is so much deeper in our society....Social media has the ability to exacerbate feelings of anxiety in adults and particularly kids who are routinely ostracized and bullied, often having no friends whatsoever.  So many will play single shooter video games literally all weekend long, breaking only for a quick meal. Our politics are broken and most centuries old traditional values are constantly under attack.\nSo people will have their usual say but a serious and thorough examination of the root causes of this problem is sorely needed from all sides, pro and anti\ngun., 2 My heart hurts for this boy. Of course I ache for the families who lost their children and the terror they experienced. But I don't want the suffering of this boy to be forgotten either. He has suffered incredibly traumatic losses throughout his life. He has repeatedly experienced abandonment and displacement. I have worked with many adopted youth who have experienced developmental and chronic trauma and the behaviors of Nikolas that preceded the shooting sound typical of someone with chronic trauma. Of course he should not have had access to weapons. But he should have had access to love and support and high quality mental health care. Notifying authorities again and again, as the president suggests, will not prevent these atrocities; it only exacerbates the experience of danger and terror that prompt these behaviors. People with chronic trauma are likely experiencing a constant sense of danger and threat and need gentle soothing, security, and consistent support to recover. The reality is that accessing mental health care is difficult and it is even more difficult to find a provider who provides trauma-informed care and is knowledgeable about the effects of adverse childhood experiences. I hope that in addition to increased gun control and access to mental health care, we can all make more of an effort to invite the stranger in and love our neighbors., 2 Long past time to again place the mentally ill in institutions with appropriate safeguards against abuse.\n\nAlso, long past time to regulate gun ownership more strictly that the purchase of tobacco and alcohol.\n\nMedical/Psychological certification\nAge limit (at least 21)\nBackground checks\nRegistration\nNational data base\nStrong penalties for illegal possession, 2 After the several London bombings over the years, it was found that every bomber was 'known to the police'.  Currently, the Metropolitan Police has a watch list of over 3,000 suspected extremists which MI5 are very concerned about, and who are being observed, so they tell us. There are a further 20,000 suspected extremists on another list who are observed, sometimes. The next atrocity will again come from someone on the list. With our laws, you can't take someone off the streets because of what the might do. It seems a similar situation with Cruz in hindsight. All the signs were there,but prevention was impossible., 2 How about a federal tax on the sale or transfer of any assault weapon or modification, say $100K per transaction?  Congress can EASILY impose such a tax.  Then, states can impose a state-operated \"liability\" insurance requirement upon each owner on each weapon, say $1000 per year per weapon.\n\nMake them too expensive for the \"mentally defective\" to acquire or own...and assist with balancing budgets along the way., 2 It is very important to understand that mentally ill people must be held accountable for their actions even though they are mentally ill.  It is one thing which keeps someone who is delusional from acting on the delusions--the thought that they could be imprisoned or executed for their actions (if severe enough).  As a therapist, I have heard patients suffering from psychotic symptoms say this...that someone who committed a violent act and was mentally ill still needed to be held strongly accountable for the actions against someone else.\n\nPeople with conduct disorders or sociopathic personalities are not somehow magically treatable...this is a very very serious problem and they can be very dangerous.  The solution is not to blame mental illness when there is a horrific incident like this where so many beautiful people lost their lives so senselessly, but to control gun ownership.  This is just so simple.  \n\n\"Limiting access for Mentally Ill is complicated\" needs to be replaced with a general limitation on access to weapons of mass killing. Period.  Not so complicated., 2 What can we do? This list isn't a complete solution and it would run up against some Constitutional objections. But we have allowed the purveyors of guns to so saturate our culture with weapons of mass murder that we may have to take some unpalatable steps to get things back under control.\n\n1) Subject anyone who make a verifiable threat of violence or mayhem to arrest, interrogation, and search of their person and places of residence.\n2) Make it a crime to know of a verifiable threat of violence or mayhem and not report it to law enforcement.\n3) Make it illegal to manufacture, sell, or own any handgun or semi-automatic (or automatic) assault weapon except those sold to and held by authorized military and law enforcement agencies. (Require manufacturers who made and sold such weapons to buy them back and destroy them.)\n4) Require, and provide free, mental health counseling to any person deemed a danger to themselves or others., 2 Someone whose behavior includes episodes of rage resulting in damage to property or humans/animals or who enjoys hurting animals is someone who should be legally committed to a good mental institution until the behaviors and problem fantasies/thinking are under control.  This type of person is extremely dangerous.  Unfortunately, our revulsion against the problematic mental institutions of the past has resulted in inadequately funded local outpatient treatment centers and too few good compassionate residential center.  But better mental health services still would not prevent all violent incidents.  Stricter gun owner and seller licensing and laws as to who can buy a gun and requiring high powered weapons to be stored at gun ranges vs at home would help prevent the disturbed person  from using a gun as the weapon of choice., 2 Perhaps we could start affecting grassroots change by looking at our own personal safety and that of our neighbor.  Specifically, it was noted that Mr. Cruz and Mr. Goldfarb\u2019s son, Bradley, had gone on a trip to a cabin in the Everglades with other young men.  Shooting weapons, which included two AR-15 rifles, was part of the itinerary.  By all accounts, Mr. Cruz and Bradley were about 18-19 years old and 16-17 years old respectively.\nScience has shown that the human brain continues to develop throughout childhood, adolescence and into early adulthood.  One of the last portions of the brain to fully develop is the frontal cortex which controls reasoning and impulse control.  According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \u201cBased on the stage of their brain development, adolescents are more likely to: act on impulse, misread or misinterpret social cues and emotions, get into accidents of all kinds, get involved in fights, and engage in dangerous or risky behavior.\u201d\nIt is laudable that the cabin owner accompanied the young men on the trip presumably to supervise for safety.  It was short-sided of the owner and the parents/guardians of the young men to expect that they could safely shoot AR-15 rifles reliably given their incompletely developed frontal cortices.   Regardless of one\u2019s belief about gun rights and ownership, the growth of the normal human brain is not complete until at least age 25 rendering gun operators under the age of 25 a safety risk., 2 This young man had issues for quite awhile. What was done to help him? Blaming President Trump is not the answer. If the Democrats wanted to do something about the gun issue they could have easily passed something the first two years of President  Obama\u2019s administration when they had sizable majorities in Congress. They didn\u2019t. There are some things that could easily be done now, like not selling this type of guns to anyone under 21. What should happen,  is more help to students who have the kind of issues that make them feel that these atrocious acts are their only option. We have a crisis of young men who are hurting and marginalized. Many turn to opioids and hurt themselves, and others tragically hurt others. What can we do to help them?, 2 Not just assault weapons, all semi-automatics. Including for law enforcement who can check out a semiautomatic in crisis situations. Anyone who, as I did, grew up hunting knows that a bolt, pump, or lever action with a three round magazine, not clip, or double barrel shotgun or rifle is sufficient for the job. If the first shot misses, the second usually misses, the third always. For over a century revolvers were sufficient for police, who now empty clips at unarmed victims. The only purposes of semiautomatics are entertainment or homicide. , 2 It upsets me when people are commenting and have no understanding of the legalities of the school system.  You need to read up on \"students are entitled to an education in the least restrictive environment.\"   This has caused students who have been identified to become a protected class.  You also need to know that until a student \"acts\", even if they threaten, nothing can be done legally.  Also there is a disincentive to administrators and school districts to \"formally\" identify acts of violence because it lowers the school and district rating.\nMy background comes from 22 years of teaching.  Prior to that I worked in corporate America as a business analyst and economist.  I went in to teaching to make a difference.  I left teaching fearing for my life and health., 2 He used his real name on the threatening post, and it was immediately called to the attention of the FBI.  Why didn't they track down every person with that name (there aren't many with the unusual spelling \"Nikolas\", interview them, and see if any were possible threats?  They surely would have found him, and some measures could have been taken, whether mental health care or prosecution for posting a threat.\n\nIt is interesting that he was adopted; adoptees have a high rate of major disturbance.  Then he was orphaned by the death of his adoptive parents, which might have been a trigger---the end of any human connection, giving a feeling of \"nothing to live for\".  At the very least, this should have put a hold on his purchase of a weapon., 2 Let me ask the NRA, what is more important: the right to live or the right to own a gun? Yes, that\u2019s right: it is just that simple. No excuses, no justifications, no fake remorse. Why should every citizen in this country of 325 million be afraid to walk down the street, or send their children to school? \n\nWe could lock up every citizen who might have a mental illness, and that would not stop the carnage. However, if we stopped the sales of guns and made gun control much more meaningful, that might get results. \n\nIf that young man had not been able to purchase a rifle, those 17 people would still be alive. \n\nThe NRA promotes death, and they don\u2019t really care. We need to stop them., 2 Notice the talking points spouted by the NRA spokesmen in Congress (i.e. republican congressmen):\n\n- gun controls are too simple a solution OBFUSCATE\n- we should look at mental health improvements DEFLECT, COMPLICATE\n- we need to improve security at the schools DEFLECT, add MORE GUNS\n(and they forget to mention concert venues, cinemas, etc)\n- AR 15 is just one weapon; or AR does not stand for Assault Rifle OBFUSCATE, DEFLECT, AVOID THE QUESTION\n\nIf you look at the responses from the congressmen and of some commentators here, they all use the same party lines., 2 Wake up.  When anyone brags about killing animals they are sure to move on to people..., 2 Why did he do it? What was his motive? Who cares?! But for the gun, he's just a disturbed young man. But. For. The. Gun., 2 The only thing that could have saved the number of kids murdered, is a ban on assault weapons., 2  I remember that washed up bloated has been Bill I'Reilly after Sand hook\":\n\" This is the price we pay for freedom.\"\nHuh ? Freedom to do what?\nPublish the name of every single one of those do-nothing elected officials that feeds at the the blood-filled trough of the NRA\nAnd then vote every single one of them out. , 2 While everyone is debating mental illness, gun control etc the FBI is screwing up case after case of terroisim and mass shootings.  What are they doing over there, 2 Normal rhetoric. The same after every mass murder in the US. Nothing will change unless politicians and the NRA are held responsible for these occurrences. When politicians are removed from office because of being Pro NRA or Pro gun then we will start to solve the problem. Too bad gun owners, but if you had dealt with your lunatic fringe we would have most of these problems.    , 2 So many signs that the President is mentally disturbed, known his entire life for bad and erratic behavior. Business associates, employees, and citizens know he is a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!, 2 Can someone actually be arrested because they look violent? Why must ever murder by a white person be because they are mentally ill? If it is mental illness then why cut budgets for healthcare? How does reporting someone who looks dangerous to the police allow the police to interview them and arrest them before they commit a crime?, 2 The cynical part of my soul is not sure this is news. There will be another next week and another the week after. My even more cynical solution to this problem is that black and brown men should break the near monopoly by white men of mass shootings. when black and brown men start doing the majority of mass shopotings, they will find a way to stop it. , 2 If this kid was poking around in your backyard you might want a gun., 2 \"But others \u2014 including a comment on YouTube Mr. Cruz may have posted last year saying he wished to be \u201ca professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 were considerably more troubling. The comment, left under the name \u201cnikolas cruz,\u201d was reported to the F.B.I. by someone who did not know Mr. Cruz\"\n\nI wouldn't assume Cruz wrote this.  It's too easy and too likely to have been written by somebody else., 2 America - the land where Kinder Eggs are banned because kids can choke on them or where buying benadryl is controlled but guns are not. In reality America's past sins are coming back to haunt her -  racism, unhindered greed, destroying other nations, bombing countries - playing politics everywhere - all this is karma., 2 More like \"Developed Nation Showed Every Red Flag\".... , 2 EVERY GUN in OUR United States of America must be REGISTERED on a national database, state LICENSED and fully INSURED for liability.\n\nJust like cars.\n\nWE THE PEOPLE must not let the gun lobby and their paid operatives in OUR governments to try to discuss \"mental illness\" or law enforcement/FBI responsibility.\n\nGET GUNS OFF THE STREETS OF AMERICA.\n\nGuns are the problem.  Nothing else., 2 The only clear way to prevent mass murder is to take away the weapons designed for rapid killing of large numbers of people., 2 It was 1971, I was around 8 and I was expelled from my school in Karachi Pakistan. Why? Because I did not want to do my homework. I thought it was too easy and if I know the answer why must I write it. Nonetheless, I was expelled and stayed expelled for 1 day until my father saw the Principal. I always did the homework after that, and of course finished my degrees from universities...\n\nWhat I have seen here is that schools DO NOT teach DISCIPLINE. The kids do whatever they like and they continue to go to school. Kids disrespect their teachers. Incredible! How dare I challenge my teachers! How dare! It simply could not happen and DID NOT happen. Furthermore, the parents here are just as much to blame. They simply do not care about the rearing of their children and often things like online games, Netflix, or YouTube are baby sitters. What do these kids learn there? Violence, violence, and more violence. \n\nThis miscreant should have been expelled a long time ago and that record should have been carried everywhere. So, early on he would have learned what is discipline. \n\nAs it is too late for all that, i think a quick track through the courts should send him to the Florida death chamber so humanity is rid of him. Perhaps that might put a thought of restraint in copy cats. , 2 The problem isn't the Second Amendment, its the Fourth.  People are all too willing to ban and confiscate guns -- particularly a class of guns arbitrarily named \"assault rifles\" to make them sound more menacing -- from the 99.99% of gun owners who never have and never will caused any harm with their legally owned firearms.  And of course, such a ban and confiscation will do nothing given the 350 million guns already in circulation and the ability to use any number of other types of non-\"assault weapon\" firearms to commit exactly the same mayhem.  But how about other civil liberties.  Want to really \"do something\"?  Get to the root of the problem:  the freaks who commit these crimes.  Expand the ability of police to search premises, seize weapons, administratively detain individuals who have been identified as mentally ill or socially maladjusted and potentially dangerous.  Same for neo-Nazis, violent anti-Fa members, and jihadists.  Let's not discriminate on which constitutional rights are thrown out the window in the name of public safety., 2 The difference between industrialized countries that do not have mass shootings like we have and the USA is that they have better and stricter gun control laws. People can hate that idea if they want to, but that is the solution. The question is how many more of our children are we going to let die before we finally do something about it? Our craze for the \u201cright\u201d to own all sorts of guns with such wimpy regulations is killing us and our beautiful children.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a mental illness to be untrustworthy with a firearm. This is why focusing on mental health won\u2019t work. Just the other week where I live there was an incident of road rage. A man shot another man in the head while they were driving. The shooter was mad he was being tailgated or something. Luckily the victim survived. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest. Most people can\u2019t be trusted not to text or talk on the phone while driving. Many people can\u2019t be trusted to vaccinate their children against awful diseases despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism or any other scary brain problem. Many people can\u2019t be trusted to pick up poo from sidewalks after they take their dog on a walk. As a country we couldn\u2019t even be trusted not to pick an incompetent and degenerate clown as a president. How many of us are really trustworthy with a firearm?  , 2 No more glorifying the Murderer. Please NYX, share the stories of the surviving and murdered victims and the money hungry politicians who have financed this and too many other senseless killings., 2 \"so is the NRA governing somewhere around here??\nwhy can't you vote against it's policies that you disagree about?\"\nshe asked quizzically.  then it had to tell her it's not a \"government\" but something with a lot of money and influence that tells the \"government\" what to do...\n\"WOW\" she said, then \"What???...\", 2 In what crazy, warped interpretation of 2nd Amendment rights can anyone  claim it justifies allowing a 19 year-old boy - regardless of his mental or emotional condition - the right to purchase and own a military-grade assault weapon? How can anyone  justify putting into the hands of any non-law enforcement, non-military person a weapon explicitly designed and intended to kill people in a rapid spray of bullets? \n\nHave we become so warped in our view of what's right and proper that we would entrust these kinds of weapons to average citizens? What the heck is wrong with this country? This horrible situation gets repeated over and over and over, week after week, and our elected (Republican) officials just sit back, sharing their thoughts and prayers, yet doing NOTHING to address the problem except offering platitudes. All the while, of course, knowing the NRA has their backs with massive campaign contributions and \"A\" ratings. \n\nEnough is enough. Fight fire with fire, I say. Our first step is to get these GOP laggards out of office all across this country. They are a cancer on our society. Next, we work in a concerted fashion to put the NRA and the weapons manufacturers it represents OUT OF BUSINESS.  These are not honorable firms run by honorable people. No, these are merchants of death and destruction. They need too be stopped, no matter what it takes. I've had it. We all have. People, UNITE!, 2 A common occurrence or after thought....Signs were apparent but nobody did anything.  When will the time come when people see certain odd things about a person a say something?!?!? It does not have told in a way that a raid occurs or law enforcement are busting down the doors but it does have to said so that proper monitoring can be conducted. We have the tools to spy on people but not the tools to engage someone and reduce the threat!? It's ridiculous. After Sandy Hook (20 small children) everyone went up in arms saying we needing to get serious. What has happened.....the same thing that happens after every tragic gun violence....absolutely nothing! People..if you see something weird about a person in public or online....alert authorities, school officials anyone so steps can be taken to reduce the threat. Just because it does not concern you does not mean you do not have to act and protect your fellow citizens. Wake up people!! Sandy Hook happen well over 5 years ago and still people do not open their mouths to bring attention. , 2 Please pass this article on Speaker Paul Ryan. Yesterday he said that  we shouldn't take away people's rights until we have all the facts. \n\nSpeaker Ryan...what additional facts do you need? \n\nStop making lame alibis for no action! You're insulting our intelligence!, 2 \"The comment, left under the name 'nikolas cruz, was reported to the F.B.I. by someone who did not know Mr. Cruz, and the agency said on Thursday that it had been unable to determine who had posted it.\"\n\nWhat?  He used his real name and the FBI couldn't find him?, 2 I hope the FBI is held accountable for their failure and subsequent lies about not being able to id the killer through his Youtube post. Here is a partial list of FBI failures to heed warnings:\n1. The Phoenix FBI warns Washington office about Arab flight students before 911.\n2. FBI ignores warnings that the mother of the Boston Bomber is a terrorist.\n3. Ignored warnings about San Bernardino killers.\n4. Gun dealer warned FBI about Omar Mateen.  FBI loses track of his wife.  Thank God under Trump she is in jail.\n5. Father of Chelsea Bomber warns FBI., 2 He showed \u2018Every Red Flag\u2019.  So what?\nRepublicans and the NRA still let it happen.\nThis country is THE joke of the world when it comes to guns and mass shootings.\nI just thank everyday that I was not shot by a gun yet, 2 Metal detectors have been used at many violent and racially-torn schools with success.  Suburbanites tend to shy away from them because they seem so ghetto.  They have an answer at their hands that will solve this problem.  I guess they'd rather fight the NRA than seem ghetto.  Every sports event I attend uses them successfully.  They don't seem ghetto to me.  They seem like common sense., 2 I wonder if he has Tourette's Syndrome?, 2 Should instead be titled \"Florida showed every red flag.' , 2 To be honest I do not think that there is anything American public can do about guns...and that is because you have no say...the gun lobby is bigger and more powerful then what the public are...\n\nLand of the Free.....that is a joke., 2 The NRA and their $ is what DC is trying to preserve...period. Malignant capitalism is killing our country. Very sad state of affairs., 2 Not true -  \"the agency said on Thursday that it had been unable to determine who had posted it.\"\nThe YouTube comment by Mr. Cruz saying he wished to be \u201ca professional school shooter\u201d was reported LAST September to the F.B.I. by a 37 year old You Tube video blogger named Ben Bennight, who emailed a screenshot of Cruz' comment to the FBI's tips account, and then flagged the comment on YouTube, who promptly removed it from the video. The FBI called on Bennight the very next day after he emailed them the screen shot, and did NOTHING until the day after the shooting when they called upon Bennight again.\nSo what exactly does it take for the FBI to conduct an investigation? Oh, maybe a phony dossier about Trump by an ex-british secret agent in the pay of the Cllinton campaign and the DNC\u2026\nBut potential mass shootings at a high school?\nJust low priority\u2026, 2 According to Republicans white males who commit premeditated mass murders are mentally insane? \n\nHe was sane enough to know he could buy an AR15 legally. He was sane enough to figure out he could kill more students if he pulled the fire alarm. \n\nThere are children in this world who don't have food in their bellies, live in squalor and never know if there will be a tomorrow. \n\nBut now, Republicans want to lob little Mr. Innocent with the label he is insane because the poor boy suffered loss and troubles? Really? \n\nDo Americans realize right now there is an attempt to retell the life history of Charles Manson? Mostly by inmates and white males who have this strange proclivity toward exoneration of guilt? \n\nMost 19 year old boys are saving for a car. This one saved for an arsenal of weapons, freely allowed in Florida. Does Scott have as much concern for the 17 dead as for saving this little monster? \n\nNow, comes the phony sweet little lambie pie act of Cruz. An Oscar award winning performance. He knows some lawyer will use his murder of 17 students and teachers as an insanity plea and prove it by showing his \"innocent lambie pie\" side. \n\nFirst of all, he is NOT mentally ill. Not unless, of course, gun addiction is considered mental illness by NRA members. \n\nWhen you hear Republicans say, \"Now is not the time to discuss gun control\" what they really mean is NEVER is the time to discuss gun control or they lose billions in NRA campaign donations. Paid assassins? , 2 I guess we'd all like to believe that Beaver Cleaver would be incapable of pulling the trigger on a gun., 2 Let Republicans run on \u201cIf you elect Democrats they will take your guns away,\u201d and let Democrats run on gun restrictions ( \u201cstop the killing of children\u201d) and let us see who wins. , 2 \u201cMR.\u201d Cruz?\nWhen will the 19th-Century Times stop dignifying criminals?, 2 These people should \"red flagged\" in middle school and high school. They show signs of anti- social behavior at an early age. The anti-social behavior should be cataloged. If we can save another terrorist attack like this, all to the good. Instead of a national grieving, there should be a day of national outrage in America. Vote every repub of of office come this November. Every repub is complicit in these acts of violence. Enough is enough. Drain the swamp in every state election, every county election, every federal. election. Vote in November to drain the swamp., 2 Why does anyone need an assault rifle except to assault?, 2 Well another tragedy until the next one.\n\nAll the tragedies that could have been avoided because we had enough information and did nothing or almost nothing.\n\nI can cite Gen. Marshal awareness of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7th 1941 and he sent a telegram to the general in charge in Hawaii.\n\nThe FBI agent who warned her superiors about Arab students learning to steer passenger airplanes but not learning how to take-off or land went unheeded and her superiors got promoted and where is she today, the heroine who would have prevented 9/11?  Anybody know where she is?\n\nRussia warned us about about the two Chechan brothers who came here with their family seeking refuge who committed the Boston Marathon Massacre.\n\nThe FBI investigated this school killer and dropped the investigation when they couldn't come up with anything tangible.\n\nIt's time to change the protocols.  Gun confiscation is not the answer.  Can you see the criminals and gang members turning in their weapons?  Only the responsible gun owners and everyone else would be in danger.\n\nOur founding fathers never envisioned mass murders in schools or on the streets of Chicago, LA, Baltimore, Detroit and NYC.  They also couldn't haven't envisioned immigration from Poland, Russia and Italy.\n\nOur fabric is torn and the tear is growing larger without intelligent decisions designed to protect the citizens of our nation.\n\nWe will never know what this world might be like today if we didn't have Pearl Harbor, 9/11, , 2 I grieve with survivors now, past and soon to be. This issue has been fixed in OZ, UK and elsewhere. South of me though, some want to be great. They were already great at mass shooting, their laws are designed to make them greater at it year by year, there is decades of proof.  They must like being the greatest at mass shooting because the majority flock like sheep to enact laws to ever increase their greatness.  Greed is good too but not the odds.  Powerball 1 in 175 million.  Mass shooting 1 in 700,000.  The voters are Nikolas Cruz accomplices. It is pitiful to watch them weasel word victims blood off their pious hands as they cut the throats of your kin with their actions day after day in the majorities' name. I believe mass shooting totals since 911 exceed the 911 death toll. The majority wants more. They blame the law, mental health and everything after the fact.  Nobody seems to trust their system of law so they have only 2 things left. To trust in god and to be ready kill anyone. How can civilized people live with that level of constant fear and paranoia? 5 year olds are being taught what to do to avoid being shot.  There are a lot more mental health issue brewing in the current greatness. A high school diploma should come with a PTSD confirmation.  America was and is great. Please, become less great. Make it harder to kill each other. Please change the national addiction from hardware to helping. Just a suggestion from your northern friend and neighbor. , 2 I only wish mental illness could prevent a person from becoming president of the United States., 2 the shift to blaming [yes. blaming] \"the mentally ill\" is just wrong.\nrepeat after me:\n\nit's the guns, stupid\nit's the guns, stupid\nit's the guns, stupid, 2 It\u2019s not just a mental health issue or gun issue.   It\u2019s both!\nI have personally witnessed a young family member being released time and time again from facilities without having any positive effect or mandated after care.   And when he turned 18, he was able to sign himself out.    He was never violent, but drugs and alcohol have been an ongoing problem.    He was sent back to the family who\u2019d tried every recourse possible.   As long as social service budgets are cut, there is little hope for people who need the help.   \n\nGuns are still easy to obtain.   Even someone on the No Fly List are allowed to get a gun and shoot up a school.  They just can\u2019t get a flight.    Does any of this make sense?    Remember the Vegas shootings.  Congress was going to ban bump stocks that can turn a weapon into an assault rifle.    That quietly went away.   The truth is the NRA runs Congress and Trump.   Trump rescinded an order the day before this shooting that would have stopped people with emotional problems from getting a gun.  He bears responsibility as well for not fighting for common sense regulation.  , 2 By the time a student gets expelled from a public high school, he/she has made life a living hell for serious students/teachers over and over. \n\nThe hellions love making life miserable for others. They know they steal instruction time from kids who want to make something of their lives. They know that it takes tons of burdensome documentation to get them thrown out. They thrive on the positive attention they get from fellow losers.\n\nWe live in a society of \"reset buttons\", \"do-overs\", and fiftieth chances, not  \"second chances\". In other words, we live in a society that has taken consequences away. Three days ago a Chicago police officer was killed by a FOUR TIME FELON.  \n\nIf those same delinquents knew they'd be put on a list to deny them from ever buying a gun in their future, I guarantee behavior problems would go WAY down. Those that can't help themselves would be put on the list. \n\nBut we live in a society that says that no matter how vicious a juvenile's behavior is, his record is expunged at 18 or 21. \n\nBecause too many in power have taken away serious consequences for even the most heinous crimes. Sanctuary cities, anyone? \n\nI would support a bill that denies a gun purchase to anyone who has been expelled from a school and sent to an \"alternative school\". \n\nAnd I'm an NRA Endowment Life member. \n\nIn Chicago, we have repeat murderers let out of prison routinely. The \"justice\" system is a total joke. The problem isn't guns, it's lack of actual law ENFORCEMENT. , 2 https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/nra-guns-second-amendmen...\n\nA quote from the article  that gives me great joy.\n\"In 1981, Republicans took control of the U.S. Senate for the first time in 24 years. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch became chair of a key Judiciary Committee panel, where he commissioned a study on \u201cThe Right to Keep and Bear Arms.\u201d In a breathless tone it announced, \u201cWhat the Subcommittee on the Constitution uncovered was clear\u2014and long lost\u2014proof that the second amendment to our Constitution was intended as an individual right of the American citizen to keep and carry arms in a peaceful manner, for protection of himself, his family, and his freedoms.\u201d The cryptologist discovering invisible writing on the back of the Declaration of Independence in the Disney movie  National Treasure could not have said it better. \"\n\nit is on page 3, 2 Officials Renew Call to Limit Gun Access by the Mentally Ill??? How about the ignorant and immoral should not be allowed to be politicians!!!, 2 Obviously family, neighbors, school realized that he was a very dangerous young man asking for help.  The best society could do was to sell him guns before age 19 then kick him out of school.  Indeed he should go to prison as should the head of that school and the idiots selling him these guns.

One of the first bills he signed after being inaugurated reinhstated  the rights of mentally ill persons to own a gun.  Wished someone would hold his feet to the fire as well as all those complicit Republicans who are the main obstacles to sensible gun reform.. Let's remember in November!, 2 Limit gun access by the mentally ill? At this point, if you want a gun you ARE mentally ill., 2 To all who think more gun legislation will somehow end this tragic escalation of mass shootings I say this; Short of BANNING ALL GUN SALES and confiscating legally owned guns from current gun owners which just IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN in this country - What will you suggest when the next deranged, evil person BLOWS UP a middle school gymnasium full of 12 year olds with a pressure cooker??\n\nSo many of you ridiculously expect our federal government to LEGISLATE EVIL. \n\nEvery single one of you will fight tooth and nails for your 1st amendment rights but somehow think the 2nd amendment is subjective?!?! \n\nOur country was born out of the constitution and Bill of Rights AND is what makes us the BEST country in the world. Without it, we are nothing and will fall. \n\n30 years ago, 50 years ago....these common mass shootings DIDN\u2019T happen with the same frequency as they do today. Yet, guns were available back then.\nInstead of screaming \u201cGet the guns out of the hands of these people\u201d we should be asking \u201cWhat the hell happened in one generation that\u2019s made it OKAY to disregard human life so readily\u201d? \n\nFor everyone who thinks there\u2019s a \u201cgun control law\u201d that will make a difference without denying law abiding citizens their constitutional right to PROTECT themselves please describe it?\nSomeone tell me WHAT new law would have prevented the Las Vegas shooting, the Valentine\u2019s Day shooting, and the Virginia Tech shooting??? \n\nI challenge you to think of one. , 2 Dear Editors:  Want to change the politics of the gun issue overnight?  Publish the photos of the dead students lying in schoolrooms and hallways.  Bring the horror to every breakfast table and break room in the country.  Do it every time there is a mass shooting.  Fill the nation with dread and rage against the fake sympathy and phony arguments of the politicians who have sold their souls to the NRA.  Ever notice how cockroaches scurry for cover when the lights go on?, 2 Mr.President,\n\nPlease talk about gun restrictions, as this is your chance to prove to us that you are mentally sound. , 2 Where and WHOsold this gun to this child?, 2 We need Federal  gun control. Certain yokel states have demonstrated that they can't handle this. , 2 27 murders per 1 million inhabitants in the US, 7 in Switzerland, 2 in Germany. Where is nation of weaklings is easy to say. No brain but what to shoot ..., 2 This man was clearly mentally ill, from every comment available from everyone who knew him.  Who in his family and community thought he should have a weapon?  THAT is the problem, not that we \"need more laws\".  Heroin and coke are illegal, and I ASSURE you people at that school have access to them.  Laws stop nothing (murder was illegal, it didn't stop him).  Would you have been ok with the mass murder had he used a bomm instead?  So the implement is NOT the issue.  The issue is an immoral, lazy society that demands \"someone ELSE should DO something!\".  America was never meant for your ilk.  \"Those who would give up essential liberty for a little perceived security deserve and will have neither.\" -attributed to B.Franklin., 2 But he got guns legally.  End of discussion.  You holier than thou legislators talking about mental health -- wipe the blood off your hands., 2 This is so predictable it's both boring and sad.  Lot's of people in this world have had difficult childhoods, are rage-prone and are otherwise a bit deranged.  Only in the wonderful USofA do these nuts have access to guns.  Hence, this happens almost exclusively in the USofA.\n\nPrayer won't do any good, repealing the 2nd ammendment will.\n\nBy the way, it seems that a mentally disturbed man with bad and erratic behavior (and funny hair) is regularly seen in the White House's Oval Office, a man who has claimed on social media that he has a huge nuclear button on his desk, which apparently is bigger and better than someone else's (what a man!).  Am I dreaming or has America put, not a gun, but nuclear weapons in the hands of a nut?  Should he be reported to the authorities again and again?, 2 He showed Red Flags, but his skin was White.\n\nSo he could not possibly be a terrorist.  Unless he were Dick Cheney, GW Bush, GHW Bush, or Bibi Netayahoo., 2 He was also raised in a patriarchal society which teaches its' males that it is in their rights to have power over others and if they don't get it, it is their right to seek revenge.  We see it all the time in movies, television shows, books, and video games.  I can't watch prime-time television or go to most movies because I have decided to avoid violence.  \n\nI didn't make this up.  It is in the book The Gender Knot: Untangling Our Patriarchal Legacy by Allan G Johnson.  He explains that we have to name this problem to solve it.  Why do you think only white men are mass shooters?    \n\nI heard this morning that he was obsessed with a girl to the point of stalking and I wonder what role this played in his actions.  Yes, his family was disturbed but he has been steeped in our violent culture then allowed access to automatic weapons and caches of bullets.  \n\nWe are living in a recipe for disaster.  Wake up, America!  \n\np.s.  Let's hear more of the story that came out a few weeks ago of Russia funneling money to the RNC through the NRA.  Follow the money.    , 2 Boycott all national chain stores that sell assault weapons and accessories. Walmart. Dick\u2019s. Cabela\u2019s. Starve the Beast!, 2 Maybe if the FBI spent less time in politics and more time fighting crime and protecting us from these wackos there would have been action on all those red flags., 2 You Americans will talk about  everything except the gun itself being the problem.You have a national gun fetish.\nThere will always be mentally ill people. You will always be gun fetishists., 2 So--just as with Nancy Lanza--we have a mother unable or refusing to recognize the profound dysfunction of her child, and enabling his illness by buying or providing to him the funds to buy guns.\n\nThe Washington Post story states--in contradiction to other news reports--that Nikolas was two when he was adopted.  Likely a spectrum of congenital problems here that a nice older couple was entirely unprepared to manage, especially since they*d taken his two-month-old brother at the same time.  And during their early years the adoptive father died and Mrs. Cruz was managing--quite poorly, apparently--on her own.\n\nAnd the hypocrisy and driven agenda of the NY Times is fully on display here.  Nikolas Cruz, age 19, is a man, while Michael Brown, age 18, was a teenager?\n\nSorry.  This is not a case of *evil.*  This is likely a case--per yet another NY Times Science article--of yet another fetally-damaged child with subsequent failed parenting by the biological mother who*d already permanently-damaged him, handed over to a couple entirely unprepared for the challenges ahead.\n\nNikolas*s life was destroyed at the moment of conception; failed parenting allowed him to destroy all these many lives now.  Perhaps available services might not have helped, though surely there are laws against animal cruelty and he was killing and maiming them.  But parents who cannot acknowledge the extent of the damage in the first place open the door to hell., 2 Make a threat against the president and the Secret Service will rightfully pounce on you. Make a threat as a potential \"school shooter\" and law enforcement investigates but only adds you to a list. Buy an assault weapon while on that list and unfortunately time ran out? , 2 This country is sick to her bones when it comes firearms. Again and again, school shooting happened. If Sandy Hook could bring more sensible controls on firearms, I don't know what will., 2 If I hear someone (like Trump) use the word \"evil\" again, I'm gonna scream!  This young man is autistic and mentally sick. He is NOT evil!\nEVIL would be the denial and prevention of universal health care for all.\nEVIL would be the unbridled availability and sale of these weapons of mass killing., 2 After we get by \"...thoughts and prayers...\" we should call a crony capitalist industry fueled by repugnant lobbyists and a donor class of big money enablers what it is: a massive altar for sacrificial young people., 2 It's time for the Australian fix for assault rifles. Make them illegal and pay market value then destroy them. Diehards with untraceable assault rifles can cosmoline them and bury in backyard in wait for the revolution., 2 \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed [...] classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again\"\n\nThis is a DISGUSTING comment by Mr. Trump, basically blaming children for knowing and not reporting, like it's their fault now., 2 Our political leaders (I use that word \"leaders\" loosely) are all,  afraid of the NRA.  They are all, republicans and democrats, a  bunch of cowards!, 2 I think the \"mentally ill\" restriction on gun ownership may be more effective that is generally thought.\n\nTalking to someone or something that isn't there, but forgives your wrongdoings should qualify for mental illness. And that would let out all the Americans who think \"prayer\" actually does anything. Including a whole bunch of really troublesome politicians and government heads., 2 This article is just a bunch of hearsay and innuendo.  This is a tragic story all around that centers around a very disturbed young man.  We need to wait until the facts are in before we start publishing all of the \"gossip.\"  Yes, let's talk about gun control and other ways we can work to prevent these events from ever happening again, but lets not sensationalize it to gain readership- very disappointed., 2 they have 17 intelligent agencies in this wonderland, and yet they couldn't stop a psycho who openly threatened on social media to shoot everyone. I guess authorities are too busy deporting highly dangerous immigrants who dont stop at the traffic light or drive unlicensed. How much more stupid this country is gonna get?, 2 ATTENTION NYT readers:\nWatch the video of the court appearance of the accused accompanying this article then read this statement made by the author of this same said article.\n\"When he appeared via a jailhouse video hookup for his first court appearance on Thursday, the judge asked him whether he understood his circumstances.\n\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he whispered.\"\n\nThen see for yourself who is a liar.  It's a lie, however white that it might be., 2 I would point out that virtually every gun nut exhibits signs and displays all the red flags. Who would join a militia in Michigan or Texas and practice overthrowing our government, not a mentally fit individual. Who would own dozens of semi auto weapons, collectors or borderline psychotics. Who would spend hours every week at the local gun range practicing to killl, LEO\u2019s or red flaggers. This is the new norm America, you voted for it., 2 When is this country going to start taking right wing terrorism seriously. \n\nThe leader of a white supremacist group that wants to expel minorities from Florida and make it a white \"ethno state\" embraced Cruz as part of his group, until he changed his mind.\n\nWhite supremacist terrorist organizations like the KKK have killed far more Americans than Muslim terrorists ever will. Then there is the anti abortion terrorists who have assassinated doctors and fire bombed clinics. \n\nThe idea that we should blame Islam for terror, slash our civil liberties with exceptions to the Bill of Rights, have a racist Muslim ban, while we pretend that all of these murders by members of white hate groups are acts of individual lunatics shows how institutional racism protects right wing terrorism.\n The president of the United States speaks in fluent white supremacist code. When a column of white supremacists carried torches chanting Nazi slogans, Trump called them \"fine people.\" This shooter had a MAGA hat. \n\nSo many people want to blame crime and violence on minorities. Even the \"liberal\" NY Times comment page, sounds like Fox News in the wake of police killing of a minority.\n\nLeft activists in this country, like native American water protectors are regularly violently attacked by law enforcement, but heavily armed white protesters are treated with kid gloves.\n\nRight wing terrorism, encouraged by our president, is the true danger to our country.\nStop worrying about ISIS and see the real threat., 2 I hqv no idea how would actually feel if if one of the victims was my child about what I Am going to say- but this disgusting display of selfish governing must be stopped by any means- I do NOT know if I would have the courage to do this- but if he parents and families were able to have the strength to let pictures even videos of th bloody scene of strewn lifeless children to be made public, surely time and time again,  it would finally allow the public to ask if the congress can still look the families in the eye, the country as a whole in the eye and say \u201c here are my thoughts and prayers....\u201d if that had been done af Sandyhook, I think the public would be willing to garner enough strength to vote these congressional accomplises out of office.  I will however send my prayers to the families now, albeit in vein, as a parent praying for them during such unimaginable tragedy.  As a country we allowed the continuation of slaughter of our young men in Bietnam\nBecause of selfish politicians and pride- this is war on our children- and here we are again- , 2 How many white males \"show every red-flag\" and do absolutely nothing like this shooter?\n\nThe F.B.I. defended it's incompetent inaction when the shooters' threatening school shooting social media threat was pointed out by disclaiming knowing when and where the shooter was going to strike and doubting that was his real name(it was). Next time the shooter should have the grace and good manners to send the F.B.I. an official invitation.  Forever, blind and ignorant will never do.\n\nWhile the notion of mental illness as being relevant to this shooting ignores the real probability of inhumane innate cruel human evil., 2 There have been rumors that the Russians funneled money\nthrough the NRA to Trump's Campaign ?, 2  \"the F.B.I. never learned who posted the comment.\" But it was their job to learn who posted it. That task was not impossible, so why is it so hard to say \"the FBI dropped the ball\"? The comment had been on youtube! , 2 \nTrump: \u201cThe Second Amendment [& the right to have arms] is on the ballot in November. \n\nThe only way to save our Second Amendment is to vote for a person that you all know named Donald Trump, OK?\n\nI will tell you. I will never let you down.\u201d\n\nMay 20, 2016: Trump's speech at the NRA Institute, thanking the NRA for their presidential endorsement, 2 Somebody used his own name (a name that at least in spelling is not at all common) to post that he wanted to be a professional school shooter. That was reported to the FBI but somehow they couldn't determine who that was. \n\nThis raises two points. The first is that \"see something, say something\" is meaningless is no one is listening. The second is that I fear the Republicans who now believe the FBI is a collection of idiots may just be right. , 2 Guns and lunatics.  Take your pick.  Can\u2019t control a lunatic.  Can control who gets a gun.  We are ourselves crazy if we don\u2019t try to keep guns out of the hands of unstable people.

Paranoid schizophrenia, fetal alcohol syndrome perhaps, treatment would have been like a bright clear dawn. , 2 The blow hard strikes again...\nA year ago....\n\nNEWS  FEB 28 2017, 8:39 PM ET\n\nTrump Signs Bill Revoking Obama-Era Gun Checks for People With Mental Illnesses\n\nPresident Donald Trump quietly signed a bill into law Tuesday rolling back an Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase a gun.\n\nWe have a winner here! Also he is against domestic violence but is willing to keep the perpetrator of the crime on staff in the White House with out full security clearance.\nThis is the president 62 million people voted for, and the GOP is protecting against the crime of obstruction of justice., 2 This is a another tragedy brought by the NRA and a compliant GOP.  \n\nThe press including the NYT has got to stop focusing on the perpetrators, this is what they want, so stop rewarding them. It also encourages copycats.\n\nIt's time to call out all \"pro-life\" hypocrisy of many in congress and government, who care more about a fetus than living children and adults.  If they truly believe in the sanctity of of life they would do all they could to stop gun violence,.  Instead they just offer prayers , 2 i'm sure there are many people who show \"Every Red Flag\" but don't go on a mass shooting spree with easy weapons (are we going to start locking them all up??) Las Vegas gun man didn't show any \"red flags\" ...\nThe common denominator is guns!\nAnd while we are on mental health- GOP does nothing about that anyway. And even takes money away from mental health issues ... I am sick of this. Blood is on hands of all those politicians taking money/ aligning themselves with NRA. , 2 More thoughts and prayers --  when will lawmakers stop praying to the God of Mammon and start passing gun control legislation? , 2 ---The gutless, disingenuous politicians, who continue to either cite the 2nd amendment, or who are either afraid of, or beholding to, the gun lobby and the NRA, need to be removed from office. The American people need to take ownership of this issue at the ballot box. This should have been done after...Columbine. That it's still unresolved, and children are losing their lives 20 years later, is...a national shame, disgrace!, 2 Because that person in the White House has such strong dislike for former President Obama, who signed a law banning guns of any sort from the mentally ill,  he revoked it......he ( person in White House ) belongs on the mentally ill list.\nHow many more of these tragedies must happen before we stop allowing the NRA  to run our country.  Each and every time a mass shooting happens at a school, those republicans say, this is not the time to talk about it.  Really...so when is the time., 2 The sadness and the rituals of mass shootings in the US. First the shooting, then images of those terrified, devastated people who survived and the families and friends of those who were murdered. Next, wait for the response from the president - once in a now seemingly distant past, in person, but now in tweets. Followed by the makeshift alters, the funerals. And in a parallel lockstep, the news coverage; the aftermath, the floor plans of the buildings, the angst about mental illness of the mass murderer, the realization (yet again) that the US mass shootings are not endemic to other civilized countries. And then, my comment post following an articulate, heart-felt article in the New York Times. , 2 Why in the gods name do you publish this unfortunate man's name and face? Why are you making him a hero to others like him? He should be anonymous? His name should be The Killer and that's it...let his real name exist in the legal system. Let his image die like the fortunate people he killed.\n\nLabel him \"unfortunate\" because he is. Take him out of society, that is why we as a society created a legal system, prisons, and mental institutions. His affliction may be genetic so never let him procreate. \n\nLet him live, give him help, but never let him back with us. \n\nHe pulled the trigger more than once. He deserves every thing we can do to keep him away from us. Yes, I feel sorry for him but it is infinitesimal compared to the sadness I feel for those who lost their most loved and a country that wallows in guns and violence.  , 2 There are many factors leading to this tragedy, most easily corrected if we, the people want to so:\n\n(1) AR-15s are of no use for hunting.  They are of no use for target shooting.  They were designed to kill people.\n\n(2) People wanting to do the \"right\" thing do dumb things instead.  A father took his son and others on an outing (good) but made \"shooting weapons a big part of the trip\u2019s allure. There were two AR-15s on the trip, and Mr. Cruz brought one of them.\"  (Bad)\n\n(3) Even after years of misbehavior and violent outbursts, Cruz still had no criminal record.  But his history was well known.  \u201cHe had trouble controlling his temper. He broke things. . . . I sent him home because he was misbehaving at our house and he took a golf club and smashed one of my trailers.\u201d  He was expelled from three schools.  He faced no consequences.\n\n(4) Even though given a screen grab of an outrageous YouTube comment, the FBI was too lazy/incompetent to investigate it meaningfully because  \"no other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment\u201d .  No effort was made to request or subpoena YouTube's records of the user account!  \n\n(5) He was able to walk into a school not with a knife or a handgun, but an AR-15.  Can you say \"ineffective security?\"  \n\nLack of consequences NEVER improves behavior.  It ALWAYS feels good to forgive and accept -- but that nevers solves a problem. , 2 This maniac is another example of how parents and the schools he attended FAILED!!!   Parents when they were alive had to have been low-class people who could care less bout their child.   Teachers - pushed him through just to get rid of him.    With his violent history, he should have been put away long ago.    \n\nWith all the guns he had = why didn't someone turn him in???   They all knew he was a mental case.\n\nGun control is a farce - however, anyone who really wants to buy a gun can get one -- without having to go through the process.......drug not only sell drugs, they sell guns too!, 2 Obama was president for 8 years? Why didn't he do anything?, 2 Anyone with an obsession with guns is mentally ill. There, I just made it really easy to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill., 2 \"How could anything have been done\" to prevent this sort of American terrorism?  Maybe part of the answer is for the American media to start calling the school shooters \"terrorists\"?  Does U.S. media have it in them to print the truth about school shooters and other American mass murderers?  , 2 All this 2nd Amendment stuff is a nonsense. Everyone knows that., 2 Whatcha bet there's a big increase in voting next November by 18-year olds in Broward County? Do-nothing legislators take notice: your days in office are numbered. , 2 Homegrown.  American.  Terrorist.\nSo much talk about \"mental illness\" and asking \"but why?\".\n\nIf the dude was brown, NOT A WORD OF THAT WOULD BE HEARD, but we would see endless dissection of his connection to the tiniest sliver of ANYTHING that could even vaguely suggest FOREIGN TERROR. , 2 America Loves Guns! America Loves School Shootings! \n\nShow me otherwise?, 2 I still don't understand why we lavish attention on the pathetic lives of these mass murderers. I think it's a big motivating factor, the desire to be famous, to be the center of attention. How about \"no more pictures of them\" and \"no more naming them and publishing extensive examinations of the minutiae of their personal troubles and travails.\"\n\nOh, I know - people love reading about this stuff. Admit it - you're here aren't you? It's murder porn and America seems to love it., 2 Maybe we shouldn't let super old people adopt children?  The father was 67 in 2004?  Did they get him overseas, looking for a white child with a biological brother? Did y'all see the arrest photo, where he is on the ground with his powder-blue undies peeking out, looking like the clown who shot up the movie theater with the dyed hair and makeup?  Looks like the hospital really got him cleaned up to look like a \"regular\" kid by the time he was walked into the police station still in his hospital gown.\n\nThe worst thing the media can do is to \"normalize\" these young killers.  Call it what it is -- a seed gone bad, for whatever reason. No sympathy, no pity, unless you want more lost souls acting out to get the same.  The media spend soooo much time glamorizing the Las Vegas shooter -- trying to \"understand\" him -- in the end, he got the attention he wanted.  This one too.  Except he forgot to take himself out, as well.\n\nYou can never make society safety-proof.  Teach children that these types are creeps -- what they cost us in 14 young lives, and 3 working hard -- is the shame of it.  Who cares why this one went wrong?  Let him rest in peace, without the glamourous media attention.  Somebody said they should set these mass killers who survive on fire after conviction, so others would be forewarned the pain they will get for the pain they cause...\n\nI'm  not there, but I know that he doesn't have my sympathy.  Rich adopted mentally ill boy gone bad... who killed so many others., 2 Here in Britain today if the whole thing has not been so sad it would have been comical to hear NRA reasons as to why the tragedy has happened ...nothing to do with guns...all to do with Mental Health...how the deluded talk.\n\nIf there are so many kids that have problems then it is a good enough reason to ban guns...anybody who goes around shooting innocent people obviously have a problem.\n\nIn my country one tragedy horrified the country...and the public...Government and Newspapers were all in support of a ban.\n\nSadly your President looked a total fool stating how your kids have a right to education safely ...but not once mentioning the terrible gun crime in your country or any mention of banning guns.\n\nFrightening., 2 No NYT. There was one huge Red Flag. An 18 year-old purchased an AR-15 and was in society. The families should go after this self-righteous police chief who is responsible for protecting the community but ignored someone in town wielding with a device intended to rapidly kill masses of people.\nAnother note: how is a gun shop owner going to insure the purchaser is not mentally ill? Get his permission to request his psyche records? And what is he looking for in those 200 pages? Depression, anxiety, bipolar, suicidal, OCD? , 2 The NRA must be outlawed, their staff and leaders jailed. They serve no legitimate purpose in our society and have not for decades.\nhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/nra-guns-second-amendmen... , 2 #NationalSchoolWalkout to protest the massacres, to demand action to protect our children., 2 Not only was the shooter a supporter of this president seen on instagram with a RED make America hate again hat, but this...\nNotably, a white supremacist organization called the Republic of Florida admitted on Thursday that Cruz was associated with the group, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nThere you have it folks., 2 Its obvious what happened here a mentally disturbed teen with no stable father and strugling mother was acting up and eventhough many classmates and neighbors saw the problems and even social media and others saw what was going on in this teens life no one would step up to try to get him help or mental evaluations people are quick to say it was the guns fault when in reality it was lack of people steping up to help teens with problems reported evaluated and dealt with in the proper way .. It brings tears to my eyes that this happened i am a father of 4 and love my children and wish to see them well and coming home from school i work and love to come home to my family... This natiom is broken hate runs rabbit within the races and hate is tearing this nation appart racism has peaked this couple of years the schools children suffer from neglect and lack of being understood they are taking away god from schools and from pledge and from bills and constitution ... If this jeeps going at this rate where will we be in 10 years how many more things as such can happen... We need to love and nuruish the youth protect the values of this nations founders and love and have god in our lifes it is a nation under god we have seen god work in the many disaters that happen... Let this not happen again dont blame guns blame the people for not seeing not loving not carring not understanding not reporting and not acting... God bless you all may Jesus love fill your hearts.., 2 Let's be perfectly honest here. This problem, like most other in this county, have underlying facets of race and racism.  Imagine, if you can, a young black man with similar red flags showing him to be a potential threat to society being allowed to go his merry way, making personal threats to people around him, posting violent-laden pronouncements, posing online with weapons, training with hateful, para-military groups.  No way, right.  Many urban cities where black-on-black crime is rampant have gang intervention groups, community-centered programs, etc., to engage young males at risk.  Profiling is a natural to the police.  Until law enforcement departments, from the local police to the FBI, are willing to show the same interest in these young white males, who are the perpetrators of the vast majority of these mass murders, many more people will die.  If young black males can be profiled for wearing sagging pants, tattoos, or even driving expensive cars, why can't law enforcement agencies profile these potential mass murderers.  Since the intended targets of many of these young, white males are other whites, why don't we call it what it is.. white-on-white crime?  Ever hear that word?  Of course not.  Such a designation would infer that just maybe there's something inherently wrong with white culture.  And considering it's important to the dogma of white supremacy to make it seem only Blacks and other minorities are inherently violent, we can't have that.  Can we?, 2 No one should be able to buy an AR-15 weapon. Period. No one should be able to own any military style weapons.  All military style weapons should be returned to the police. Australia did a recall of all weapons after a mass shooting and there haven't been any since then. America must take drastic action now to stop these murders!!! , 2 More our Govt reduce spending on education, health care and other social safety net and social mobility measures, more we will see such kids, teens and adults taking up guns and taking part in such mass shootings, besides increase other types of crimes.\nBut no NRA lobbyist Congressmen seem to care and/or have that much education and commonsense to understand it.  , 2 Yes, we need much more mental health care. But without the guns, this kind of mass murder in such a short time is just not possible. Nobody needs an assault rifle. Period. You argue there are millions of them already out there? Outlaw them anyway, with an amnesty period and a generous buyback, after which possessing one will carry jail time. Melt them down to create memorials to the fallen, or to build schools., 2 The question for any politician running for office this fall should not be, \"What are you going to do about assault weapons?\" The question this fall should be, \"What have you DONE about assault weapons?\", 2 One thingbthat always worries me, that after incidents like this there is a rush of hysteria, and a call to supersede civil rights, as though there are a hundred thousands kids like Cruz just waiting in the wings for that moment when insanity wins out over sanity well, really there\u2019s not. You can count on the fingers of one hand the number of teenagers who in the long history of the United States have shot up a school. Everything about Cruz\u2019s life is very unique, a orphan who is adopted and becomes a second orphan. Never give up one single civil right ever for whatever reason . As  Benjamin Franklin said: those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety., 2 And since the gunman \"showed every red flag\" and still was able to massacre his teachers and classmate is why limiting the debate to mental health is disingenuous.  Folks let's talk about gun control and not just background checks, instead it should include limiting the places guns can be purchased and the ways they are used, the types of weapons that can be obtained, and the places where you are able to take them.  Yes, there are entrenched interests that will oppose this at every turn, but the pressure builds and builds over time and then change happens, often quickly.  It is time to keeping turning the pressure up and pushing for change.  It is coming., 2 My 'flash of rage' is with our ineffectual government: it is endangering all of us, and for what? For what?\n\nPass gun control legislation now. Better background checks is a palliative. Pass gun control legislation now.\n\nWe want our kids to stop dying now., 2 Once again, we are reminded how well thoughts and prayers work. How much sadness and anguish do we, as a nation, have to endure before we demand action?\n\nA major opportunity for getting some reasonable gun control at a national level will come in November, when we can vote the NRA-funded accessories to child murder, OUT OF OFFICE. But, unless there\u2019s another horrible shooting shortly before election day, we\u2019ll probably forget about the bloodshed of innocents, stay home from the polls, and let the criminals get reelected. Then we can continue to ease our consciences by thinking and praying rather than acting and voting. Will we then, also be accessories to child murder?\n\nTHE ONLY THING NECESSARY FOR THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL IS THAT PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL DO NOTHING., 2 Want to start to fix this problem? If Congress and the President do, the first thing they would do would be to add a special tax on guns and all related products. This tax would in turn cover all the costs related to such crimes and that would include burials and the related life insurance, health care costs, police and ambulance costs, special security costs etc., etc., etc. Once those who seem to have a need to have a killing tool pay for all of the related costs, just like those of us who drive pay for roadways and car insurance, then maybe the leaders of the nation will be able to learn what these costs really are and then in order to make a lot of taxpayers happier they would have to fix this mess., 2 There has always been a percentage of the population that truly suffers with mental illness of a very serious nature.  In forty years of working as a librarian in all kinds of public settings, including a school, I recognized this.  The difference is a gun in the hand of a person who is irrationally angry, or distraught or delusional.  It is morally reprehensible that the rights of gun owners have superseded the health and safety of our citizens.  Into the ear of every Senator and every Representative who opposes gun control, I would whisper: \u201cWhat if that person belonged to you?\u201d, 2 A mental illness problem? Only for the bought and paid for Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio who have an obsessive disorder with love of NRA money. Parents across America should know that for $3 million Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio will do nothing to protect your children at school, the movies or a ballpark.\nUnfortunately, they are not the only representatives bought by the NRA.\nThere needs to be a full investigation and public disclosure of NRA donors and who they give their money to. There needs to be public disclosure of how our representatives have voted on gun legislation. Note to Bernie Bros.\nAnd if Americans really care, they/we need to get off our sofas and VOTE.\nAlso, 2 questions: Why was the FBI not able to find the shooter after he posted his very direct threat on YouTube? Was it too hard?\nWhy was the shooter not caught while exiting the school building? It was an active shooter situation and he had a rifle! Weren't the students or their backpacks searched? , 2 This event will be forgotten within a week. After the Las Vegas massacre, we  couldn't even eliminate the \"bump stock\" device used to increase the rapid rate of fire for a semi-automatic rifle. Congress is a joke. And the joke is on us.\n\nWe've heard lots of shoulds: we should do this, we should do that, etc. But nothing gets done. \n\nAs a former soldier and law enforcement person, I am steadfast about the elimination of war weapons like the AR15 in the hands of ordinary citizens. Every police chief should be as well. But we don't hear from them. These weapons have been turned on police at various times.\n\nThe minimum thing Trump could have done was form a Task Force on School  Violence. Instead, we got a teleprompter, written for him speech, until the next time., 2 I recall reading that as a youth President Trump exhibited behavioral problems which led to his parents enrolling him in a high-priced private academy. Would that all families had access to the kind expensive care needed to take care of their loved ones, and would that our President was denied access to guns and malicious tweets., 2 Let's be direct. School shooting and for that matter all shooting will continue to be part of American life as long as we do have the notion that all people are protected by the second amendment and that it can not be repealed or updated to reflect the realities of the twenty first centenary. The individual citizen no longer requires a weapon for protection in our modern society and the vast majority if Americans do not carry weapons. Legal use of guns are for sports and hunting. I own a gun and have used it for this purpose for years.\nWhat is needed today is gun regulation. We need to register guns, show proof of how to intelligently use the gun before a license can be issued, require all gun owners to comply and legally inforce this requirement just as we inforce having a driver's license, felons can never own a gun and if caught with one they will receive mandatory prison time and the owner loses the right to own future weapons.\nGuns collections owners have to prove their collection have been disabled with bolts removed.\nAny action short of intelligent gun control and regulation will never solve the problem and we will continue to see these tragic events that have become so common in American life. It is time our elected leaders realize they work for the American people and not special interest groups. , 2 If I remember correctly, a young Donald Trump was sent to a military school after years of acting out, throwing objects in class, and reportedly punching a teacher. After a campaign of bullying and consistently inciting violence against others, he is hardly the person to lecture us on mental health and stability. Clearly, this young man had a terrible and troubled life. In other countries, where common sense prevails, he would never had access to military grade technology, and caused the carnage that he did. It is time that we joined together, and demand that our politicians deliver accessible mental and health care, and common sense gun safety laws. , 2 Commenters aren't wrong to blame our gun rights lobby for making it harder to prevent disturbed individuals from conducting mass shootings.  But the problem within our culture goes much deeper than that.  As a nation that prizes individualism, we are becoming a society of narcissists.  The problem isn't mental illness.  There have always been mentally ill people among us - and how many people do you know who are perfectly sane?  No.  These are atrocities that are committed by center-of-the-universe types who will inflict unlimited amounts of suffering on others in order to assuage their own internal pain.  As a society we have a great deal of work to rebuild communitarian spirit and to put less emphasis on everybody's a winner, self-esteem child rearing., 2 Others here can argue about guns I want to comment about the difficulty in getting help for children before they harm themselves or others. The facts as anyone who has dealt with mental health services, protective services and school systems knows is that they are set up to do the least possible for most troubled children. Coordinating between them is an exercise in futility, getting help without excellent insurance coverage runs from difficult to impossible and CPS will only deal with cases that are the most extreme. We talk and talk, we have laws regarding neglect and abuse that are often ignored and because its all so very difficult to deal with we put our collective heads in the sand and hope it goes away. Then one day a deeply troubled young man takes an easily available gun and uses it. The warning signs were there and clear. Everyone around him from schools to neighbors to medical personnel ignored them. That\u2019s the default action almost anywhere in the USA, schools have policies and mission statements but neither the will nor resources to act on them, Child Protective Services has the laws and regulations to act but neither the resources or employees with the skills to effectively help. This is a societal problem exasperated by a hyper individualism that refuses to accept that we are social animals. I\u2019ve seen the consequences of this on a personal level and it will take a community level response to end this cycle of damage and harm. Time to stop looking away!, 2 We can\u2019t continuously read the minds and moods of three hundred million people. We can far more effectively reduce the carnage by wresting military grade weaponry from their murderous toolkit. No civilian needs large capacity clips, rapid fire long guns or armor piercing ammo. If we expect the police to arrest, detain or otherwise prevent the antisocial from acting on their impulses, we must give them the legal tools to intervene. Buying a gun should be harder than getting a drivers license. Owning a mass casualty weapon, harder than becoming a commercial pilot. Of course we must radically improve mental heath related resources. Naturally, legislators should also write laws that improve the odds of intervention. Most importantly, it\u2019s time to stop deluding ourselves into believing that the mass production, promotion and unlimited distribution of mass casualty weaponry isn\u2019t the true root cause of all these modern tragedies. , 2 Protocols for most schools in case of active shooter is run, hide, and fight. What additional protocols should be in place for teachers or professors who are in these types of situations? Teachers training isn't the worse but it's not the most effective either to just hide, run and wait for the perpetrator to be attained. If the perpetrator does end up in your classroom what do you do? In my opinion there should be protocols or other types of protection system in addition to protect the teachers themselves, and at the same time helping them defend their students in the class if the perpetrator happens to get into their classroom. I'm not saying that teachers should carry or have lethal weapons in their classrooms but I feel as if teachers should have a contraption that can help them fight if the situation arises. An idea I had in mind was to have some sort of long range taser in a mounted extinguisher type cabinet with security alarm. Yes, students may try to tamper with the cabinet but that's why security should be placed. Obviously students should not have any access to the boxes only trained professionals. As teachers you're expected to take care of your class. I understand that certain individuals would panic and probably not use it or forget about it. If I were in this situation I would of at least wanted some type of defensive device to have fought back with instead of dying without a fighting chance. Run, Hide, Fight are good procedures but not exponential procedures. , 2 I\u2019m genuinely curious and not trying to be accusatory. What does a private citizen do with an AR-15? Do you hunt with it? Is it used for home protection? I can understand wanting to own a shotgun or rifle, but I\u2019ve never understood the desire to own an AR., 2 Unless one is in the Armed Forces or a member of a SWAT Team, there is no good reason to possess an assault rifle. The current state of affairs exists due to the NRA successfully buying off (mostly GOP) politicians. Campaign finance reform and the overturning of Citizens United are two essential steps to changing the status quo. It is in the financial interest of the NRA to increase guns sales by whatever means possible. All who take money from the NRA should be voted out of office. Every last one of them., 2 There needs to be a discussion about gun laws. Yes people will say that it still would have happened even if there were laws in place, but we really don't know that until they are. However to not even have a discussion does a great injustice to those 17 and the future. , 2 Every country has the troubled, disenfranchised and extremist. What would happen if in their rage they did not have easy access to guns or semiautomatic weapons? \n\nLook to Canada and other countries who put their children's health and safety before profits. \n\nWhere is our shame? Where is our resolve to put out children first?, 2 So, with our 20/20 hindsight, we are now able to see that Mr. Nikolas Cruz showed every single red flag imaginable in the weeks and months before Valentine's Day.  Too bad no one was looking!  \n\nMaybe it's time we started looking.  That's an easy enough step.  Maybe it's time to start making as intensive scrutiny of prospective and current weapon owners as always occurs AFTER a shooting tragedy, BEFORE we put another high-capacity, rapid fire weapon in another pair of hands.  After all, the precious Second Amendment REQUIRES a WELL-REGULATED militia.  So, let's start having some well-regulation.  \n\nAnd while Congress is at it, they should turn their attention to Article I, Section 8, which charges Congress with the responsibility of prescribing a discipline and training to be imposed on the militia by the states.  There's pretty robust language in that Article, if it weren't ignored.  If someone feels a need to own and \"bear\" one of these weapons, society has the right to know, on an ongoing basis, just what that individual is up to with that weapon.  Ongoing supervision and discipline is a necessary requirement, to prevent future mass shooting events.  , 2 Focusing on mental health is a diversion created to bypass the main issue of gun possession. Nothing will change unless people come in streets against Guns and turn it into a mass movement. An agitation of sorts, with picketing, sit-ins, boycotts, General strikes and other non violent means, like they do in some other countries. I guess, only that may make those who choose to be deaf hear. Let there be a \u201cMarch against Guns\u201d like the Million march, women\u2019s march, etc. , 2 I will not vote for anyone, regardless of party, who won\u2019t advocate for the banning of assault rifles. It\u2019s not too much to ask for. It needs to be the first question asked at debates, by reporters, most importantly by voters. Pie in the sky wish would be to fully scale back to only. revolvers, shotguns and hunting rifles just to keep the 2nd Amendment intact.   , 2 Another terrible tragedy.  This has to end but there is no way that congress will ever put stricter rules on the ownership of fire arms.  Trump's election proves that there are enough people out there that will keep the NRA in power by creating a fear of the \"other\".  \n\nA possible solution is to ban the magazines.  It was not so long ago that we limited magazines.  A limit of 5 bullets in a detachable magazine for rifles and 7 for pistols would put a limit on the killing power of these weapons without banning the guns.  A limit of 8 bullets for internal magazines (The Mr. Garand exception)  People could keep their property but have a limit.  If someone if found with an illegal magazine then they lose the right to own firearms according to the law.  This will get the hi capacity automatics out of circulation without taking away the guns and playing into the NRA's propaganda. \n\nWill this end the plague of gun violence.  No it will make the USA safer than a border wall or ending chain immigration.  We have met the enemy and it is us.  , 2 An individual's mental health is often invisible, a gun is not. Focus on what may be seen not confusing, non-specific behavior. Shooters are troubled--mentally ill, if you will--and dangerous, but it is us, as a society who light the fuse and   continue to put instruments of death into their hands.\nDoes anyone else think it's strange that the parents of the friend of an obviously troubled young man allowed him to bring his AK 15 into their home, and that he was permitted to take it on an outing that included shooting?\nMr. Cruz is not the only one demonstrating troubling behavior!, 2 \"The president, who generally opposes new gun restrictions, has focused on mental illness during mass shootings, and did so again on Thursday,\"....An assault rifle with an extended magazine has only two purposes; to kill lots of people very quickly, or to play with as a thrill toy. In either case, anyone who wants to own one has already defined themselves as having some degree of mental problems. , 2 For people who are \"connected' all the time, we remain remarkably disconnected when it comes to real interactions with people and actually listening to them, picking up on cues, and taking action when necessary.\n\nYears ago I was at an election night vote watching event at a large hotel in the area.  There was a cash bar, and hundreds of people were milling in and out of the room.\n\nI noticed a woman I didn't recognize (I knew a good percentage of the people in the room) who looked a bit out of place and a bit \"off\" as they say.\n\nI observed her for awhile and then went over to her and quietly asked her if she was ok.  She started to cry and she said she had just found out someone she was close to had died and was very distraught.  She was not connected in any way to the vote watch event.  She just wandered in.  I asked if she was driving and she said that she was a guest in the hotel and would be staying there that night.  She thanked me for noticing and left.\n\nWe need to see each other.  Really see each other.  Hear each other.  Listen to each other.\nModern \"communications\" strip that away.  We don't look in people's eyes anymore.\n\nThere is always something that can be done.  First thing of course, is to stop selling weapons of mass destruction to anyone who is breathing., 2 I was about to read this but stopped myself because I\u2019ve been hearing about how reading about and paying attention to the killer is exactly what they want and is part of their motivation (the notoriety). It\u2019s also what the public wants. How does this happen? How is a person moved to do this? What happened I\u2019m their life? Nonetheless, I think there needs to be another way to report this information without giving attention to the killer. I am drawing a blank as to how to do this but I\u2019m sure yose with more expertise have though of ways. , 2 Mental illness is impossible to define and every individual possesses a full spectrum of mental capabilities and disabilities within them.  \"Crazy\" people sometimes make perfect sense and \"sane\" people sometimes act horribly.  I am sure the government is fully aware that this is a wormhole in which there will be no solution found and nothing will change our situation with guns.  They are merely buying time until the next distraction.  I am a parent of a ten year old in Brooklyn.  We have discussed ways to survive an active shooter.  We've also discussed this nations dependency on guns and the fascination with violence.  He is growing up knowing a United States that he cannot depend on to be rational or remotely responsible to ourselves or the world.  I told him frankly, you may be witnessing the end of a very short-lived experiment. , 2 \nHow many more innocent souls will be lost before ALL AR-15 weapons are banned and removed permanently from public access?  Why must this one single issue be so complicated?, 2 Every school kids is at risk in this country because of the irresponsability of the politics. For every kid that is dying we should name the opponents to stricter laws, 2 What a sad story.  Certainly this country seems to refuse to do anything about the mentally ill who live on our sidewalks and elsewhere.   We also seem to refuse to do anything to check the proliferation of high powered guns and ammunition - what a lethal combination:  mental illness and guns!  \n\nWhy is it necessary for citizens to own an AR-15 or any other  rapid fire weapon?  The 2nd Amendment says \"well regulated\"., 2 The late highly esteemed conservative Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, ruled that the Second Amendment to the Constitution did not endow a right for any private citizen to own an assault weapon. The scores of knock-offs of the Ar-15 are carefully engineered death machines, with high velocity, fragmenting bullets, to rapidly kill humans at a range of up to 1500 yards on a battlefield. These weapons are banned in many states and throughout Canada, They were banned from 1994-2004 under the Democrats Clinton Assault Weapons Ban. Republicans must be voted out to protect our children and our schools. We need to restore that common sense law which the GOP let expire under GWB., 2 Call this what it is: domestic terrorism.\n\nHere is a question that keeps nagging me.  Authorities (school, law enforcement) had known of the perpetrator's intent, known about his training by white christian militias in Florida, and were aware of his desire to show off his gun collection (as he did on social media).  His peers were pretty sure he would do something like this; and he was advertising his intent to those who would hear.  \n\nWas this preventable?  If so, how?\n\nWe are horrified, and saddened - of course.  But are we really aware of the magnitude of change we want?  Americans love guns like idol worshipers.  NRA holds the country hostage.  White militias do these kinds of things proudly, openly (or did you forget Oklahoma), and will stop only when they own slaves or have produced their version of pristine Norway.  They are currently hosting, coddling, training, aiding and abetting the next church arsonist, murder, terrorist. And they have explicit support from churches, radio, TV, and politics.\n\nIf easy availability of guns is a problem (and it is), then the warm embrace of white militias in perpetrating domestic terrorists is inextricably linked to this problem.  \n\nI see that a lot of Americans are against guns.  The number of people who are  interested in dismantling the white christian hate machine - is a significantly smaller number. And this will get in the way of any real reform, and any real prevention in domestic terrorism. \n\nKalidan, 2 President Donald Trump and Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, who has not presided over a state which has suffered yet another mass shooting, both made calls to keep guns out of the hands of people with mental illness.  But what evidence is their that Nikolas Cruz has a recognized mental illness?  The early evidence seems to show a disaffected youth filled with anger who committed premeditated murder on a large scale, and has already accepted responsibility for his actions.\n\nIn an effort to undermine any and all efforts at reasonable gun control measures, like outlawing private ownership of military assault-style rifles, like the AR-15 used by Mr. Cruz, Republican leaders are now quick to declare anyone committing mass murder with assault rifles as \"mentally ill.\"  But by the same logic, the angry, disaffect men who join Al Qaeda or ISIS in an effort to feel empowered are merely mentally ill, and not violent terrorists.  No one would accept such a premise, and the United States has engaged in a decades-long effort and extraordinary expense to combat these groups.  If we are ever to be serious about protecting ourselves, our political leaders will devote as much effort and expense to get weapons out of the hands of the public., 2 \"Prayers and thoughts\" have no value, meaningful action must happen.  The sad part is that even modest proposals have been met with irrational resistance.  For example,  William Ruger, the founder of Ruger Firearms,  was ostracized by the gun industry when he proposed limiting gun magazine capacities.  Gun magazines for weapons such as the AR-15 can hold as many as 25, 30, 42 bullets or more. There is no rational basis for anyone possessing these magazines.  \n\nThe definitions of semiautomatic and automatic are often confused, as they have to do with reloading and not firing. Virtually all handguns, with the exception of revolvers, are semiautomatics.\n\nA better ban would name specific weapons and their specific features and also prohibit the manufacture of successors to these weapons with the same or similar features. The AR-15 would be a great start.\n\nThis also must be combined with rigorous mental health and background screening.\n\nWhile none of this may prevent horrific school shootings,  sanity has to start somewhere., 2 Well, sad to say, but it's unlikely anything substantive will be done to change any laws or regulations about every citizen's right to bear arms. And certainly not in a country where even more states are now allowing open carry permits as a standard practice.\n\nThe myth of the free individual in America is at the center of this issue. Here's the ultimate irony: with more freedom to own more guns, the entire society is thereby held prisoner to the cult of the gun as the quintessential symbol of freedom. \n\nTime to get out of Dodge, I reckon. Or get a new marshal who can truly clean it up.  , 2 Regardless whether wise or unwise for other reasons, it is a fact that gun prohibition would reduce the number of gun deaths. This is by definition since if there really were no guns, then there could be no gun deaths. But even if a total absence of guns could be accomplished, it would not end massacres like this one now being deceptively used by gun control advocates to promote their agenda. The reason is that people who commit these massacres are very different than people who kill with guns in personal disputes or in furtherance of some other crime. Massacres are very much premeditated and usually involve extensive and intricate planning. If persons intent on committing a massacre could not get guns, then they most likely would use home-made explosive devices or some other manner to kill many at one time (like Timothy McVeigh did in the Oklahoma City bombing which killed 168), 2 Sadly, this appears to be another issue (like immigration) where there is likely a solid consensus among the majority of the country, but the two major parties have instead subscribed to supporting the extremes.\n\nThose who followed the 2016 democratic primaries may recall the criticism, scorn and attacks that Bernie Sanders faced for allegedly being \"weak\" on gun control legislation.  Sanders argued, convincingly to me at least, that people living in regions like his own in Vermont would never support him as a candidate if they believed that he would be part of a movement that would take away their hunting rifles.  He also defended his decision not to vote in a way that would open up lawsuits that would put firearms manufacturers out of business, and for this, he was attacked by Hillary on stage, and by her supporters in the press.  We all know how this turned out in the end.\n\nIn 2020, the DNC may want to take this under advisement if they hope to win back voters who exercise their second amendment rights in the course of filling their freezers with venison for the winter.  These people, many of whom voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, aren't racists, or deplorables, or unworthy of being courted by the DNC., 2 As I read through the accounts of Mr. Cruz's behavior over the years I am reminded of the Sandy Hook shooter.  While I believe that our lax gun laws are the root of our problem in all of this, I am also horrified that such an obviously disturbed child was never provided with the appropriate mental health treatment.  The article states that Mr. Cruz was adopted; I am curious as to his age at the time of adoption.  Some children who are adopted at an age past infancy suffer from Reactive Attachment Disorder which can lead to such behavior problems.  The article also mentions autism.  As a psychologist I treated adopted children who suffered from these issues; the treatment was provided at State expense as part of the adoption.  The adoptive parents were aware that their children had special needs.  I question the circumstances of Mr. Cruz's adoption and how the state of Florida handles such cases (I live and practice in Michigan).  The adoption service, the schools, the parents, the neighbors--everyone knew that something was wrong and I see nothing about mental health treatment other than a brief mention of a special needs school.      We are supposedly the richest country in the world and yet we fail our children on so many levels.  We failed Mr. Cruz; we failed the children of Stoneman Douglas High School.  We fail every child in the nation when we allow the proliferation of semi-automatic weapons throughout our society.  When does it end?, 2 There is a pretty clear pattern to the school shooters backgrounds. Why don't we use that to put laws into place that enable and require law enforcement to review gun ownership or access for students reported by the schools or colleges as troubled individuals? And to enable removing those weapons until the person involved has passed a professional mental health screening. If we don't, we'll keep hearing that law enforcement knew about this person but felt they couldn't legally do anything. Will that infringe on some individual rights? Probably, but those they shoot have rights as well and we have to get a balance that works. I'm an NRA member and wish the NRA would support some action along these lines.  , 2 I understand , and if wrong let me know , Canada has a gun regulation that one applying for a gun had to have a  close family member endorse  the person getting a gun.  That sounds like a great check and balance from those who would know the person well.  Please review and advise , 2 Focusing on mental health will not address this problem for a host of reasons.  So, he showed signs of trouble, then what?  Did he do anything for which he could have been arrested or even detained for mental health reasons.  Even if held on a detention order for assessment, he would have likely been released, and at best ordered to get counseling, but for how long, and who is going to monitor and enforce it?  You can't force people to remain in therapy, and then there are the financial resources to pay for it.  Even people with good health insurance have to pay an appreciable amount out of pocket for therapy, and they have to be motivated to remain in therapy.  Fact is, unique to this country, is easy access to deadly weapons.  We desperately need stricter gun laws.  If it was illegal for Cruz to have an AR-15, and the police were called about his unusual behavior, it would have been within their right to confiscate his weaponry.  What's happening is this country is insane!! Republicans have blood on their hands and should be considered accessories to murder.  Their refusal to act to protect our citizens is a gross dereliction of duty a the very least.    , 2 If Trump had not supported white nationalists, as this person is reported to be one, would this not have happened? Trump took $20 million from the NRA. Trump has publically incited violence multiple times, even aimed at another presidential candidate. Trump is now making it easier to buy weapons like the AR15. Hard to conclude that Trump is not responsible for this. , 2 Everyone in Florida who thinks that there needs to be change in Washington should attend a protest when Trump appears. Words aren't enough. Too many have suffered. \n\nWe need leadership and real change. , 2 It seems the Congress has been bought and paid for by the NRA.  Gun owners have rights.  The rest of us just have the right to try to protect ourselves from gunfire.  There are no safe places left in this country\u2014not home, place of worship, mode of transportation, entertainment venue, educational institution, nature, etc.  No age group is spared.  Perhaps the only answer is to vote out the current crop of NRA defenders and insist from our candidates that they pledge not to receive a cent from that organization.   The Congress is no longer responsive to the majority of citizens in this country.  , 2 Gun control is not gun elimination. It merely means that disturbed, underage individuals like Mr. Cruz will not be allowed to get their hands on guns. Or perhaps it will mean that certain weapons will not make their ways into the hands of anyone, because they are unnecessarily dangerous. It will not mean that you can't keep a little handgun in your night table drawer. As for the flawed argument that \"criminals find a way..\" he wasn't a criminal before this crime. And if we really feel this way, let's get rid of all laws, because they're all pointless., 2 Republicans' focus on pinning the blame on mental health (rather than our gun laws) is a dodge that allows them to avoid confronting the politically powerful NRA.  Mental health has become their prescribed \"talking point\" each and every time this happens.   \n\nRhetoric aside, the fact is that the Trump/Republican budget cuts mental health spending by a half a billion dollars.  If practice conformed with the rhetoric, this figure would be expanded dramatically.  And to put the spending cuts into context, one must appreciate the abjectly pathetic state of the current mental health system.   If you've ever known individuals in need of such care, you probably know how difficult it is for them to get real, lasting help.   That will become more true as minimum benefits are cut further, and as more and more people are priced out of affordable health insurance.   \n\nWith regard to gun control, the founders obviously did not contemplate the existence of automatic assault weapons when the protected the \"right to bear arms\".    One does not need an AR-15 to shoot deer, pheasant, etc..   \n\nAn AR-15 exists for one reason - and one reason only...  To kill multiple people - all at once. \n\nIt is clear that something should be done, but it is shameful that Congress lacks the moral rectitude to protect our children from future harm., 2 One of the sad ironies here is that this person was too young to by a handgun in Florida.  The legal age is 21.  But there is no law on the books in Florida from preventing anyone of any age from buying the gun he bought.   And when the governor of Florida was asked about that, being the lying hypocrite that he is, he punted., 2 It is just about time for a general strike where kids are not sent to school until this insane situation is worked out. Understand, this is a serious step, but killing school children is beyond insane. When they are not in school, we have to set out community schools, but this has been done before, as in NYC school strike in the '70s and it was not easy, but this is all beyond belief and the NRA corrupt practices must be halted as soon as possible. Planning this would at least show we are serious. Imagine losing a child in a school shooting. It is unimaginable to those who have not had it happen to them and it is unimaginable to those who have had it happen to them.\nWe must not allow the insane hypocrisy to continue. DT is so similar to these wounded boys who are the shooters. Can you hear me?, 2 I am 80 years old, live in Canada, I have no idea where I could go to buy a gun., 2 I think they call this typically a Mental Health Issue. Really? That\u2019s the excuse? I wonder how many millions of people fit this category? It\u2019s so easy in the aftermath of this tragedy for the arm chair psychologist to explain why we have so much gun violence in this country. Other countries have mental health issues, maybe even more than we have. Why don\u2019t they have school shootings like we do? Is it only because they don\u2019t have access to weapons? Maybe. Maybe not. The US has over 5 times the number of weapons available than any other industrialized country in the world. Do you think we have a gun issue even more than a Mental Health Issue? Duh., 2 Let's now watch our so-called president and congress do nothing, because that's all they know how to do....nothing.  And since many of them are paid handsomely by the NRA we know nothing will happen.  Of course if one of their own precious children had been killed, we might be hearing a different story.  We have a worthless government.  , 2 It was only last February that the courts struck down a 2011 Florida law (signed by Rick Scott) that prevented doctors concerned about a patient\u2019s mental well-being from even asking about their patient\u2019s access to firearms. They couldn\u2019t even ask a seriously depressed patient if there was a gun in the house, or specifically ask parents of young children about keeping their guns in a safe.\n\nBecause physicians are often the first contact when a patient isn\u2019t yet heavily involved in the justice system, giving them their voice back to raise concern with a psychiatrist and law enforcement is beyond important. Patients who are flagged with firearm access and anger/addiction/depression/psychosis/etc. can be watched more carefully to prevent many kinds of killings, including suicide.\n\nUnfortunately this was not the case in Florida, as the law was only recently overturned. It is my guess that Florida is currently in the process of enacting laws and local procedures to move patients toward the best treatments since last year.\n\nThe history of this facet of gun ownership is yet one more way that we have failed ALL of our children, the shooter included. We have to be able to talk about guns, whether the NRA, GOP, and the sitting governor of Florida like it or not., 2 Very sad situation with a disturbed person. Restricting sale of automatic weapons makes sense. But no gun law will stop a deranged person from doing something crazy., 2 Read the Trumpateer papers like the Washington Times.\n They act like it's a major concession to consider discussing mental health when it comes to gun ownership.\nAnd they are screaming to arm teachers with sidearms in the classroom.\nThree point six million guns (one for each primary and secondary teacher)   out there will make the classrooms so so much safer.\nIt will further the education of youngsters by closing schools for in service mandatory combat shooting exercises and target practice.\nNo chance of gangs jumping teachers for their weapons., 2  All over the world there are similar tragic cases of young man without guidance or love. But only in the United States can they easily and legally buy a gun that spews billets by the second. \n\n And then there are the issues  which we choose to ignore. Cruz wears a MAGA hat and trains with white supremacist militia but he\u2019s just \u201cmentally ill\u201d - right? I do not deny that one is mentally ill if one chooses to kill people. But if he were a Muslim and did this we would certainly be looking into those  kinds of connections.\n\n\u201cSchool safety\u201d from Trump, Scott and NRA means more guns. This helps a faltering gun industry but not school safety. \n\nWe - teachers and students,  are not safer from being shot in a free for all shoot out. Only a craven gun salesman would say so and only a frightened public would believe something so stupid.   \n\nTeachers and students want freedom from guns. We must stop this madness. , 2 Why do news organizations continue to show photos of these killers and mention their names over and over, isn\u2019t that what they want?  , 2 In retrospect it is always easy to see 20/20 and wonder why no one did anything. But in reality there does not appear to be any one major incident that would have indicated Mr Cuz would do something like this. Sounds like the death of his mother in November was the catalyst that probably caused him to feel that he had nothing left to lose. It sounds like there were some very nice neighbors and friends like the Snead family who took him in but it wasn't enough to keep him from going over the edge. One does have to question what a person of his age is doing with an AR-15. It really is time to do something about the automatic rifles that do nothing for hunting and allow these mass shootings. When the 2nd Amendment was written, there were no 'automatic' weapons and I am not so sure the intention of our Founders was to allow such weaponry since it did not exist. , 2 He had a gun, for crying out loud, that right there is your problem. , 2 After maybe 20-30 more attacks no one will notice any more. These scores of live wasted are necessary  down payment on crazy gun laws that allow unselected civilians to own rapid fire guns ,to use in engagements of their own choice  and usually the murderer takes  own live.    The gun law is embraced as\na real religion  and the sacrifices are necessary  for the well being of the gun god.  Human sacrifice is not new  and the followers of this rite encourage all\nAmericans to stand up proud for the firearms god whatever the costs., 2 No need to ban assault killing machines; just restrict their sale to persons over 99 years of age. That should pacify the NRA. , 2 This boy was mentally ill. Trump is right to focus on mental health. The gun didn't shoot itself., 2 Lessons learned from Parkland, FL:\n1. When hispanics go on a killing rampage....they suddenly become \"white\".\n2. We've been \"having a conversation about gun control\" for thirty-forty years now....but not one single politician will admit it.\n3. Gun Control obviously does NOT work.  Not in USA, not in Venezuela, not in Syria, not in Burma, not in Africa....no where.\n...\nQuestions not asked:\n1. Does Nikolas Cruz like to play 1st person shooter video games?\n2. How did a high school reject even acquire so much fire-power?\n3. Where was the loving, supportive, concerned counseling this guy obviously needed? to the point he was recently in a Mental Hospital.   It appears we're just \"going thru the motions\"  , no individual responsibility, just a shoulder shrug and blame hanging on faceless \"society\"., 2 Spineless politicians and an industry only thinking of profit. Both are hiding behind AND misinterpreting the Second Amendment. Can this Congress and the pompous windbag we have for President solve this problem? Sadly, I think not. Add this tragedy and it's resolution to why we most vote for common sense in November., 2 I see here two predictable trouble spots. First, President Trump manages to squeeze in tweets about DACA in reference to this awful \"American carnage.\" Secondly, Nikolas Cruz, with an obvious Hispanic surname, is now electric with Trump's scare tactics about both his Mexican Wall and its need to be finance to keep out \"criminals and rapists.\" \n\nUnhappily, this event is tailor-made to distract attention from the running sewer that is the Trump administration and Robert Mueller's quiet, patient investigation of Russia's connections to this presidency. The president's not-very-subtle connection between Hispanics and violence rings alarm bells across the land. Congress, sensing national revulsion, will dig in against the DACA kids, who had nothing to do with it.\n\nAnd Donald Trump, it should never be forgotten, paid humble homage to the National Rifle Association, telling the group that \"you got me elected.\" Now that the Parkland assassin is revealed to have experienced severe behavioral, emotional and mental issues, the \"president\" yesterday mentioned \"illness\" as a cause for the disaster. He never once made reference to the fact that his signature lies on a piece of paper allowing anyone (no background checks required) to purchase handguns. \n\nAnd Congress sits on its hands and does nothing as yet another location is marked out on a map where an unhappy person went to take out his collective anxieties on administrators, teachers and students. \n\nKind of sad, yes, Mr. \"President?\", 2 Maybe all those innocent kids coming out on stretchers after being shot with an assault weapon will make all American people, including a majority of bribed Congress people, but not likely Trump, from saying such dangerous, disingenuous, violence provoking, and 'dividing' things as this:\n\n\"I love the old days. You know what they used to do to a guy like that?\" A guy was protesting, making noise. \"They'd carry him out on a stretcher.\"\n\nI have little hope that faux-Emperor/president Trump would ever actually mean what he said in his first Tweet, about being \"Totally Opposed to Violence\", but for the rest of 'we the American people' who founded our country against an Empire, and who don't believe in Empire --- may well be smart enough and brave enough to stop acting like the violent, militarist, politically deceitful and Disguised Global Capitalist Empire that our founders hoped to peacefully overcome., 2 If I'm not mistaken, the President signed into law last year that mentality challenge person could not be prevented from buying a gun?  To me an Assault Rifle is not a gun, but a Killing Machine designed to kill humans!\nRegardless, the gun did what it was designed for.  Insanity!, 2 The FBI clearly dropped the ball. Instead of wasting resources on fake Russian collusion, they should have been watching this guy. There needs to be a full investigation. If they failed to follow-up on this youtube video,  heads should roll. What did Comey know, and when did he know it?, 2 Please don\u2019t anyone say the failing lies in people not reporting people like this to authorities. The authorities knew all about him. Then they permitted him to buy a machine gun. \n\nIt is true that we can\u2019t lock people up because they\u2019re a little \u201coff\u201d. But it is also true that they CAN be kept from legally buying a gun. There is no rational explanation here other than that open gun laws resulted in the death of 17 innocents this week. , 2 A seriously mentally ill kid, who has shown signs of sudden outbursts of anger and violence, is able to purchase a military assault rifle. Why???\n\nIf he were a self proclaimed terrorist the federal government would have been all over him. Seems the only real involvement the federal government had with him was through a computer program that rubber stamped the purchase of that gun., 2 Roll the tape. Thoughts and prayers;  moments of silence;  and onto the next mass shooting.  Repeat as necessary. , 2 Almost all, if not all, of the mass school shootings happen in public (not private) schools.  Why?\n\nPublic schools are \"data\" and testing factories, causing high stress for kids and teachers.  Principals, solely interested in securing a raise and a promotion, will enforce whatever draconian measures it takes to get good scores, regardless of the stress.  To the principals, damaged kids are a hassle standing in the way of more money.\n\nDamaged kids are never helped in what has become of the public schools.  The general citizenry and even most public school parents have no idea what is going on and how much better private schools really are despite the millions public schools are taking in each year.   , 2 Brought to you by the National Terrorist Association, Guns Over People, and and Americans Republican Death Panels who organ-harvested brains and replaced them with 2nd Amendment 'Free-DUMB !'\n\n\"A well regulated dementia, being necessary to the paranoid and delusional security and of a murderous state, the right of children, innocents and peace-loving Americans to be randomly and viciously slaughtered and massacred by the nation's male lunatics, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe NRA-GOP national public safety platform.\n\nVote on November 6, 2018\n\nAmerica's children deserve long lives, not an early death, cruel 'thoughts and prayers', and the National Terrorist Association ensuring that the next gun massacre happens in a theater near you.\n\nHuman rights ?\n\nNot in Republistan, Americans., 2 What can be said that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? Assault weapons need to be banned as well as any weapon that can be turned into one. However, there is a large portion of the population who dreams up sci-fi conspiracies of deep-state government takeovers with black helicopters and internment camps orchestrated by Obama and HRC where these weapons are necessary. As is the case with our president, reality-- no matter how malignant-- doesn't make a dent in their mythology. How can it? With mouthpieces for the NRA like Marco Rubio taking over three million dollars, what can be expected? The lack of human compassion as well as common sense is astounding., 2 Way back I was not allowed to buy some alcohol because I was 19 years old.  But buying a gun at that age is just fine.  A very sick country.  Welcome to America., 2 If all of us who had a rougher childhood than Nikolas Cruz chose to become killers what excuse would there be? An excuse is a failure to accept responsibility. \n\nPerhaps if assault weapons were once again banned,and those existing were bought back and destroyed we could send our children and grandchildren to school and be fairly confident they would return home intact. Nearly three thousand high school students attended Douglas High School, 17 children and teachers were killed. The rest, and their families will carry with them the scars of terror and grief, the only impact in this world of a selfish and cowardly individual who blamed the world for his misfortune, rather than rising above it.\n\nNo excuses are acceptable for this monster, or anyone else who disregards the rights of others to go about their daily lives free of fear and anguish., 2 At a certain point (and we are long past this point) it doesn't really matter what the motivation of the gunman was. What is irrefutable is the fact that he had an AR 15 semi-automatic rifle. Also irrefutable is that there are 17 murder charges rather than 17 assault charges. , 2 Ban the sale of all automatic weapons to anyone.\nBan the sale of shoulder arms or handguns to anyone under twenty one.\nIntroduce a buy-back program for automatic weapons already sold with a ninety day window to comply. If after ninety days an automatic weapon is discovered in the possession of a private citizen he is to be given prison time.\nWill this end the carnage? Of course not but it will reduce the body count., 2 A good friend, who has taught for more than 30 years, said  many people think kids have problems in high school, but in fact, there were serious issues throughout their entire school career and the problem was just passed on each year, to the next grade.  , 2 Gun advocates say something like \"How do you know who to prevent from buying a gun ?\". Perhaps the criteria for purchasing a weapon should be the other way around: the potential buyer has to prove he or she is of exemplary nature, has demonstrated his or her maturity, has a history of tranquility; any bad marks in the last five years, and one is not eligible to purchase. In some locals aren't police, those people who carry weapons all the time, given psychological examinations; why shouldn't potential gun buyers undergo the same scrutiny ? You want to buy a gun, show me you can be trusted with one, not the other way round: I have to show you can't be trusted to use it properly.  , 2 So, make this about mental illness and then allow families to sue gun manufacturers and distributors for allowing their weapon of mass distraction into the wrong hands. \n\nWith a gun death every 15 minutes, we could wrack up enough lawsuits to drive these companies out of business. Nothing unAmerican about that., 2 I hope everyone in America sees the video of our children being slaughtered.  It is time we adopted the rules followed by the rest of the planet -- gun control works, and is consistent with democratic rule.  We need a change of mindset.  , 2 Children grow up knowing American adults value scoring political points  more  than their lives.\n\nDo we think that will make us great again?, 2 Using \"mental illness\" as the excuse for this troubled young man's actions is misplaced and it gives anyone with a diagnosed mental illness a bad name; it throws them into the large pool of people who make bad decisions on a daily basis.  It certainly looks as though this young man was identified as troubled for a number of years but there is only so much that can be done in a society that favors the NRA over the safety of its people.  If the NRA had given 33 million dollars to organizations that help at-risk children this may have ended differently...but they did not, instead they gave it to Marco Rubio for his election campaign.  \n\nGet out and vote like your life depends on it..., 2 Cute final line to the article. I am sure the victims families would love it. It would be great if the media thought through how much this line of coverage contributes to new shootings. \n\nIf someone runs into the field in a televised sporting event, the networks are thoughtful enough not to show it and give the perpetrator free publicity and discourage more invasions. Why can\u2019t the same level of discernment be applied after 17 people have been brutally murdered?\n\nAmerica is addicted to disasters as a form of entertainment and the media obliges. Sure there is a lot Congress can do if they weren\u2019t I the NRA\u2019s pocket. But anyone who now knows the shooters name or facts about his life, or who has spent more on Starbucks this year than on concrete action to counter the NRA payola is also contributing to this scourge., 2 Instead of passing more silly new laws which, in essence, say \"this time we really, really, really mean it\" we should enact Federal legislation which will require all gun owners,  to be 21, pass background checks, undergo proficiency tests, carry firearm insurance,  and hold them STRICTLY LIABLE for ALL harm caused by their guns regardless of who uses them. That's vicarious liability, as with cars.\n\nWe need all guns and ammo to be traceable. As with cars, guns should have Certificates of Title so we know who owns what gun at any given moment. And the ammo? When I buy eggs at Trader Joe's each egg is imprinted with a code. We can't do that with ammo so we can see who is buying what and in what quantities?\n\nDo this and people will safeguard their guns and transfer them legally. Of course if the guns and ammo are stolen and the owner was not complicit or negligent in allowing the theft to take place the gun owner would be off the hook. You're not fool enough to leave your car parked on the street with the windows open and the keys in it are you?\n\nNothing that I have suggested conflicts with that pesky Second Amendment., 2 Maybe Cruz felt like he had no one. He had no living parents- maybe he was depressed. There should've been someone for him to turn to. if there had been maybe things wouldn't have happened that way. \n\nI\u2019m in no way trying to minimize what the kid did- he murdered 17 innocent people and he should pay the legal penalties for his actions. But after we do something about guns, which we never will, we need to look at mental illness, school bullying, cyber bullying, and a host of other things that this country does to make kids feel alone and abandoned. \n\nWe can do nothing. But right now there is another mentally disturbed young man between 18-30 who is saying to himself \u201c Why don\u2019t I try this.\u201d, 2 Boys like Nikolas Cruz were not born evil or mentally ill.    Seething anger that erupts in a spasm of blood is not a genetic or theological condition.  It is often a product of neglect and abuse, bullying and humiliation.   Every backstory of a man bent on extreme violence is a story of a boy bent by the indifference or cruelty of a milieu lacking love and compassion.   It may happen at home or it may happen in a school where some boys are isolated in plain sight or taunted with no one paying attention.  The one nearly universal factor is that these boys are desperately lonely.  In a few cases, like the two often-bullied boys who riddled Columbine with bullets, they bond with another and the rage is compounded., 2 Mental illness is not worse in the USA than in other countries  . The difference is the availability of assault weapons and the lack of strong enough background checks . This is obvious . When politicians start talking about mental illness or that we have to be more alert or that we have to be nice to each other , they are playing you . They are fooling you and that includes the mainstream media . Place blame where it is due . , 2 My heart, thoughts and prayers to everyone in Parkland, FL along with other places in past history affected by this unspeakable and atrocious tragedy. \n\nAs a young millennial who has seen the recurring news reports about school shootings, it hurts both my heart and soul to see bright, talented and innocent young minds have their lives taken away at the hands of someone with serious mental health issues. Both mental health and gun control needs to be taken care of ASAP! Our world has become more vulnerable to every heinous act taking place. Personally I can\u2019t bear to watch any more of this atrocity unfold and don\u2019t want to raise my family in this environment!\n\nAlso, if Trump and the rest of the politicians can stop bickering at each other and get their act together in this heated minute, the world will greatly appreciate that! I\u2019m truly disgusted that our political sphere has been nothing but a circus of \u201cmore talking and less doing.\u201d Grow up and please show some compassionate care for this beautiful world! People like me deserve peace and solitude with little to no hatred or violence involved! #enoughisenough, 2 The FBI's explanations of why they couldn't ultimately locate Cruz after he posted his message on YouTube just seems so lame.  20-20 hindsight always seems easy but why couldn't every school district in the country get a message advising them if they have a Nikolas Cruz in their data base, and secondly if he has had a troubled past.  For sure, the school district would have been able to flag him.  \n\nIf there's a privacy issue, let him sue for that later. , 2 This story paints a portrait of an antisocial misfit who probably wanted attention. After mass shootings, newspaper reports always try to dissect what went wrong with a young person to make him so dangerous to other people. Mental issues are what the president and Paul Ryan focused on after this mass murder spree, not the lure of guns and the destruction they cause. Their concern is misplaced., 2 The NRA is responsible. Totally. I am a senior citizen who grew up in northern Vermont among a host of males who owned guns and used them for only one purpose: hunting. I was not one of them. But I respected those men (there were very few women back then who hunted) because they made certain that those guns were for only one purpose. And back then, as far as I know, there was no National Rifle Association. Most assuredly none of those men back then needed to belong to any such organization. The Second Amendment is not about gun ownership for the purposes the NRA claims. It was only about the need for a militia. Well, we hardly need militias today with the military complex this country has created. Of course Congress and this horrid president will do nothing to stop this type of horror. They are too busy collecting money from the NRA to run again for office so that while in office they represent not the people who elect them but the lobbying organizations such as the NRA. , 2 The degree to which this young mans life and emotional troubles parallels the shooter's life in Newtown CT/Sandy Hook is striking.   , 2 So he posted that he wanted to become a professional school shooter on YouTube using his real name, and the FBI couldn't identify who it was? What? , 2 Since one of Trump's and the GOP's first pieces of legislation in 2017 was to weaken restriction on people with mental disorders from buying guns, just where does this bunch of lying politicians hide now. It may be a mental illiness problem then why did you pass the new legislation and where is the funding. Lies, lies, lies. If we know when Trumpet will appear in South Florida to drop his crocodile tears, left thousands turn out the give him a large Bronx cheer. 80% of Americanms are feed up with this crooked clown.  LOCK HIM UP, 2 There is an urgent need to fix responsibility.This is America where everything needs to fixed & proper answer has to be proffered for life to go on without realising that an inanimate item is not the cause to this catastrophe,it's the GUY,Nikolas Cruz,himself.\nTomorrow,an arsonist will set fire to an barn & you will call for an immediate ban on all incendiary products beginning with Match Box.\nThe problem with Nikolas Cruz is that he is having no problem.\nLiving an self indulgent,highly luxurious life in picturesque Florida,he got bored of being too happy & decided to go nutty & the result is unimaginable consequences.\nOur founding fathers Adam & Eve also could not handle the stress free life in the Eden Gardens & you know why we are punished by God with \"WORK\".\nThe US State department needs to immediately reconnect with North Korea & it's benevolent dictator Kim Jong Un & sign an bilateral treaty with the hermit state to send disturbed Americans to North Korea for Correctional training.\nAs for Nikolas Cruz,well the post mortems have begun of his life..., 2 A broken boy doing everything he can to be disruptive. How does that not sound familiar? Cruz, like Trump...one more mirror of a country flushing itself down the toilet., 2 What more can be said about gun violence that destroys the lives of innocent Americans and their families? Everyone knows the dire problem and the obvious remedies. It's about ending the ready availability of weapons of mass execution. Our stores sell semi-automatic, military-style assault rifles; large-capacity magazines; armor piercing bullets; silencers. These aren't for hunting, for sport, for protection. They're for rapidly killing large numbers of people. We sell them in stores and on line, to young adults whose pre-frontal lobes are not yet fully formed; to people with a history of domestic violence; to people with known mental disturbances; to damn near anyone willing to visit a gun show to avoid a background check or waiting period. No honest person can seriously pretend that these mass tragedies mean that America has a mental health problem, but not a gun problem. No other country on the planet (that is not in a civil war) suffers the level of gun deaths that rips through America on an all too regular basis. The NRA and its allied federal and state politicians from both parties who have been paid and pressured to do nothing to curb gun violence are morally compromised. Ignore the hollow \"thoughts and prayers\" in their press releases. These politicians are complicit, unindicted co-conspirators in past and future murders. So are voters who keep them in office without demanding meaningful action to address this sickening trend., 2 I'm sick of the debate. I'm sick of this happening again. I'm sick of the long, sensible but useless NY Times reader comments. I'm sick of republican lawmakers saying how sorry they are. But I know this. Ever since the absolute non response after a bunch of 5 and 6 year olds were slaughtered at Sandy Hook School, there is nothing more to discuss. These children and future children and adults must be sacrificed in order to satisfy the lunatics in this country who simply won't be reasoned with and the crooked politicians who accept donations from the NRA. It will not change. It will not get fixed. More children will die. And if you can't accept that, you need to move to another country. Understand?, 2 How many of us intervened when face with a child engaging in animal cruety/weapon crimes (ex: a neighbor's 1 y.o. shooting a pellet gun at ducks in the canal). We spoke with the parents&gt;&gt;no changes. Animal services/law enforcement was next. The child was eventually ordered to counseling after phyciatric screens. Flash to 2018&gt;&gt;the child is about to graduate with a major  a in pre-med, we heard. The parents still do not speak with us.\n\nThis murderer, when he was a child, cornered squirrels and killed them with rocks, the advanced to killing birds with a BB gun, according to press reports and TV interviews with former neighborhood children.  \n\nExplain to your children what troubling signs are and ask them to share them with you.   And what parent buys a BB gun for their child  while living in a suburban neighborhood?, 2 Thoughts and prayers is a by-now hackneyed phrase that means NOTHING. Until we address the American adoration of guns this will continue. And yes, the same old thoughts and prayers will be trotted out every time. The only way we\u2019re going to slow this (stopping is probably beyond hope) is to get rid of every public servant, every candidate, who accepts funds from the NRA., 2 And lost in this whole morass is another victim - this gunman's younger brother - Not yet a legal adult and with now absolutely no one in the world.\nWill Broward County take him in or cast him out?, 2 When nothing was done at a Federal level after Sandy Hook it must be glaringly obvious that tragedies such as the latest one in Florida are seen a mere \"collateral damage\" in the pursuit of profits for the gun manufacturers. If people don't start letting their \"elected\" lawmakers know that this is not acceptable using their votes to do so Americans will get what they settle for. How the bigwigs at the NRA sleep at night is beyond me. , 2 The last line of this article is powerful: Unarmed and anonymous, Mr. Cruz, finally, had blended in among them., 2 Mental illness is present everwhere. Only the US has arsenals of military weapoons available to anyone, 2 You know what I don't understand about Republicans? They claim that gun control is useless because someone who really wants to get their hands on a gun will find a way. But they're totally fine passing laws restricting abortion, even though women across the world and through the ages have always found a way to have one. The difference is that restricting abortion causes deaths (think wire hangers), while restricting guns saves lives. They have it completely backwards. , 2 One of the most important functions of our modern government is to make sure that absolutely nothing gets done about any of the major problems facing this country.\n\nWe can't solve the drug problem because that would put a lot of cops, lawyers, and prisons (private and public) out of business. They like the status quo, it works fine for them, and they don't want anything to disturb it.\n\nWe can't solve the race problem because that also would put a lot of the same folks out of business along with political consultants, talk radio hosts, and many politicians themselves. Again, the status quo is working just fine for them.\n\nAnd we can't solve the gun violence problem because that would put both gun manufacturers and the NRA (etc.) out of business. And the police would no longer have cause to buy all that ultra-cool military gear they've been stocking up on.\n\nOur government has been carefully crafted and finally tuned to exactly assure that nothing can be done about these problems. So don't get your hopes up now about finally solving the problem of kids being murdered daily by angry young men. The best we're likely to get is the formation of another House and/or Senate \"study\" commission who can then study our children to death., 2 We have to draw the distinction between rights as an absolute and rights as a protection from arbitrary action without due cause and process. If we acknowledge the government\u2019s role in regulating our driving, then so too should it for gun ownership. , 2 Terrorists?  Legislators that accept money from the NRA and refuse to do anything about guns.\n\nEnemies?  Elected leaders in this country that have the power to change gun laws, but won\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s get real here.  Stop blaming parents, mental health issues.  \n\nBlame our taxpayer paid representatives that allow these murders.  , 2 Until we are ready as a country and a culture to put reasonable restraints on our Second Amendment rights - analogous to those placed on our First Amendment rights (time, place, manner - no right to yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater) - this will continue. And we are not ready - listen to the deflections of the right and the handwringing of the left for your proof. I believe that because we are not ready, our elected officials feel free to consider these deaths - indeed, all gun deaths - as a cost of doing business with the NRA.  And they will sweep this shooting under the rug along with all the rest.\n\nRight now the NRA is waging asymmetric warfare on us - the majority wants gun control but a minority defeats it.  So what can be done? When we are ready to change, we will.  We will vote, single issue, just like the NRA wants its members to do. We will form a single organization to which we donate that goes head to head with the NRA. In the end, this is a numbers game, and the numbers are on the side of those who are not Second Amendment absolutists. We can, we must,  and we will run the NRA-backed politicians out on a rail. , 2 I keep thinking about all the arguments that even if there was more gun regulation, criminals would still be able to get guns. But, unless I'm mistaken, none of the recent shooters had a criminal record before. They were just regular white guys, able to legally purchase fire arms that have no business being allowed by anyone but a military., 2 French national radio's France Culture, on their noontime news today, had a report of Cruz'z ties with a Florida alt-right group. Do you have any information on such an association ?, 2 What hypocrisy when Trump immediately labels this event as a mental health issue and vows to do more, yet on Feb. 28, 2017, he signed legislation that made it easier for severely mentally ill persons to own guns who are on Social Security Disability meeting these 2 criteria: a) They were receiving full disability benefits because of a mental illness and couldn't work and b) they were unable to manage their own benefits, thus needing the help of a third party to do so.\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/trump-gun-legislation-mental-hea..., 2 So many, many broken hearts on Valentine's Day and my very heartfelt concern goes out to all those who have been so harmed by this hideous shooting. But we as a country are responsible. We have allowed this. Our Congress is beholden to the massive, wealthy gun lobby, primarily the NRA, and they should be beholden to us. The gun lobby uses fear and the faulty 2nd amendment excuse as the threat to keep the gun culture simmering. There is absolutely no threat to our Constitution by having strong background checks for ALL gun purchases no matter how or where they are purchased. This includes gun shows and internet sales. There is NO reason to not BAN any and all assault/military weaponry from the general public, no matter how the gun manufactures try to mask them with slight alterations or change of name  We should not allow open carry except by those in law enforcement. Any necessary concealed weapon permit should require an extra layer of security and education. Mental health is a separate issue; important but the immediacy is to get guns off the streets. We just have to push our lawmakers to do as we wish - and vote them out if they don't.  , 2 First - I fully agree about the laxity in sales of firearms, and find Nicholas Kristof's suggestion - creating legislation which parallels our restrictions on driving  and owning  motor vehicles - to be a promising way to reframe the arguments.\n\nI will wait to see what more of Cruz history - we already know enough to realize  that he had multiple deficits and  he wasn't ever able to function \"normally\" in school or society.  His problems had been noted time and again by every layer of society that he encountered.  Many also must have known that with the death of his adopted other he had no regular guidance, no single person he was connected to, who had with a deep concern about him. -\n\n Maybe there are also major gaps - in what treatment was provided, in what is available, and even in the area of mandated treatment or suitable program.\n\nFor the time being we do know that simply delaying his ability to purchase a weapons and as much ammunitions as he wanted - just delaying it - would have prevented this particular massacre.  , 2 Time to call out Congress for the Wimps they are.  There is No Amount of Money you could pay me to ignore this Country's continuing slaughter., 2 Every teacher and student in this country should walk out of their classrooms and stage a strike until concrete promises are made to address the issue of easy access to killing machines. Parents and children demonstrating in DC, at NRA headquarters, in front of their local representatives offices, in every city in this nation would be historic and impactful. Wouldn't this be an excellent lesson  for our children. , 2 Parkland, Sandy Hook. The President reaches out to comfort with in hollow irony: \"We will do all we can\".  The truth? Trump, Republicans (and their Russian bots and wealthy friends like the Kochs and Mearcers) will do everything. Everything for rich white children.  They will do nothing for those with mental illness, disability, autism. They will do nothing for those who suffer poverty or need food stamps to eat. They will do nothing for those  speak Spanish, hail from Mexico, Haiti, or Africa, escaping the worst dangers that humanity can offer. He will do nothing for those who are Muslim. He will do nothing for those whose parents brought them here are children, without proper papers. He will do nothing to restrict the worst automatic weapons in out streets as they meld into our schools, too, pandering  to the NRA. He will do nothing to help children breathe clean air or receive a fair education. He will do nothing to restrict the terrible emotional effects of the internet and social media on the developing minds of medically fragile children. Nikolas Cruz is a Child of America created by those who talk cheap but do little, those who say one thing, yet do another. Trump and his party do not care about children. , 2 This just in: Mass shooters are mentally ill. Wow. Really? Who'd a' thunk it? With health care in shambles and the GOP determined to shred it some more I guess we better get used to this., 2 With the millions upon millions of people in this country who have anger issues, trying to stop gun violence by identifying potential shooters will be like trying to empty the ocean with a bucket. What has to change in this country is our gun culture. I am all for banning the sale of any assault weapon, bump stock, etc. The NRA, the criminal racket, needs to be targeted by thousands of lawsuits until it withers and dies. It's the same reasoning that is being used to fight the opioid addiction in the country. \"Last week, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma announced it will stop marketing its painkillers to doctors. According to Bloomberg, the company told its employees that it will eliminate half of its sales force and send a letter to doctors this week telling them that salespeople will no longer go to clinics to talk about their opioid products.\" But please note, this action wasn't taken until the lawsuits started piling up., 2 That Ryan stands in the halls of our government and tells us not to \"take sides\" is an abomination. Our congress is an abomination if legislation is not forthcoming banning the sale and distribution of assault weaponry in this country. It's time to take a serious look at how this nation treat guns and gun control - and school children., 2 \u201cPresident Trump, we need action, we need change,\u201d she said, tears streaming down her face. \u201cGet these guns out of the hands of these young kids and get these guns off the streets.\u201d\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Cruz had mental issues at the time of the school shooting. But last year Trump and Congress undid restrictions aimed at mental illness. \n\nWhat can a president do? It is really the job of Congress AND the president to do what she is asking.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/02/15/politics/trump-g..., 2 A number of the mass shooters in recent years had been treated for mental disorders, or committed crimes, which disqualified them from legally acquiring the guns they used for their heinous acts. For example, Dylan Roof, Devin Patrick Kelley, Seung-Hui Cho, to name just three.\n\nHowever, because of, what, bureaucratic snafus(?) their names were never entered into the FBI's National Background Check System. So they went out and legally purchased their guns. Passing the background check each time.\n\nTherefore, it is possible that if Cruz, 19, had received mental health support, and been adjudicated mentally ill prior to his crimes, and had been disqualified from legally owning a firearm, his name still might have fallen through the cracks in the current system, and he might have passed a background check, and walked out of a Florida gun store with a deadly weapon, anyway., 2 FBI says it was unable to identify who left an \u201cI want to be a school shooter\u201d comment on a YouTube video last year. The poster used the name \u201cnikolas cruz.\u201d Were they thrown off because he didn\u2019t capitalize his name?, 2 \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, \" - the real DJT\n\nSo what? What does it matter. Trump believes that mental illness is no reason to deny anyone a weapon. On this we don't have to sift through his Tweets we only need to observe what he did: Sign a bill that removed restrictions aimed at preventing some mentally ill people from having guns.\n\nWas it perfect? No. Would it have prevented this? Doubtful. But when the only thing you've done is make it easier for mentally ill people to have guns and have not anything to correct what the NRA called a flawed law (that is any law that might restrict the sale of a gun) you can not call out mental illness as an excuse. , 2 Guns. Hand guns. Shotguns. Rifles. Assault guns. The second Amendment. Mass murder. Suicide. Hand gun murders. Mental health. Rage. NRA. The common thread, guns. To avoid real responsibility for many of these atrocities by saying guns are not the principle problem defies reality. To shove all this on mental illness is absurd. That is what Trump did today. Did not even mention guns. We attack many heath problems with millions of dollars. I have no idea of how much money and years have been spent on cancer with no total solution. Progress, yes. Regulations yes. Smoking(the AK 15 of cancer) banned in many places and minors can not buy cigarets etc. Saved some lives, maybe many.  Easier to buy an assault weapon. And certainly very little money and effort assigned to mental health. Health issues are complicated. And a long way from being solved. Simple, rational regulations are not that complicated. Age limits, training requirements, licenses, bullet limits, screening(real screening), banning assault weapons, are all rational and could be done quickly. Likely, no. But any or all of these would save some lives. Shouldn\u2019t be that hard\u2026, 2 Cruz cannot buy alcohol, because he is too young, but he can by an AR15 assault weapon, legally, even with a record of life long mental health problems; and widespread knowledge of his unusual behavior including boasting of his desires to harm others.  \n\nWatching the 18 year old journalism student who survived the attack speak on CNN saying \"were just kids\" that we are the adults, we are supposed to protect them; it has made me think: what kind of society is it that cannot even protect middle class high school students?, 2 Can we label the NRA a terrorist cult?\nCan we call the GOP a terrorist sympathizers?, 2 The focus on mental health is wrong. Mr. Cruz didn't \"slip\" through the cracks, as though there were some mythical cure or way to stop or pre-jail anyone who makes aggressive comments, has violent tendencies, or loves guns. Many tried to help Mr. Cruz who has multiple problems and has suffered losses that still don't add up to shooting 17 of your classmates, even if some were bullies. What stands out is the lack of regulation on the sale of guns, especially to anyone under 25, the age at which the human brain is fully formed. Even those in the military or police are highly supervised, and their weapons can be taken away if they appear erratic. No other country not at war experiences the level of murder that occurs in the U.S. No other country blithely sells guns online, or sees instruments of murder as a taxable profit-making venture. Would we sell Fentanyl this way? Yes, criminals will still be able to get illegal guns, but there would be many fewer murders and mass murders happening if it were illegal to purchase guns for most of the population or at least, for anyone under 25. Hunters might get a different license, but only be able purchase nonautomatic weapons. There should no online gun sales, or sales in stores selling other products. There should be no open carry. Finally, mental health records are confidential, not open to gun sellers. Voter against the NRA Republican Congress., 2 When pressed, Governor Scott said that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d in looking at measures to make sure this horror doesn\u2019t happen again. For starters, how about a law that people under the age of 21 cannot legally buy an AR-15, as this shooter did?  That should be a simple, non-controversial place to start. Sadly, I doubt that will be so. It would offend the sensibilities of the NRA which bankrolls the Republican Party.\nOne need only look at Paul Ryan\u2019s response that we shouldn\u2019t \u201ctake sides\u201d. or make this \u201cpolitical\u201d.  How can any decent person not take the side of our children over the NRA which is nothing more than a shill for the gun industry?  How can one NOT want to even try to work on sensible, constitutional gun control measures that will save lives, as data suggests would be the case?  How do these hollow men sleep at night?, 3 Having been sorted into journalism\nand selected as Pretty Boys, the\nnetwork newsmodels will\nnow go over and over what Nikolas\nCruz did wrong, in gory\ndetail. Instead of going back to\nfind out when Cruz went wrong;\nwhat happened, to identify, change\nand fix what made him go wrong: we will\nplay the Blame Cruz Game. Only by\nblaming Cruz, totally and wholly,\ncan we absolve all schools, systems,\nadmins, teachers, coaches, students\nand authority of all responsibility.\n\nIf killers are Made, then we\ngot to go back and find out what makes\nthem. Identify those schools, military\nand political constructs, authorities and\npowers, who either willfully or passively\nneglected them, or actively violated them\nin some way. People in positions of\nauthority would have to be id-ed, challenged\nand disciplined. In the most autocratic\ncountry in the world, we cain't have authority\nchallenged and disciplined. \n\nObviously, since none of You can be\nblamed for Nik Cruz, he must have been\nborn, that Way. You add a whole new layer\nof autocracy to identify, segregate and\nincarcerate the aberrant sooner, so\nyou can abuse, ignore and dismiss them,\nsooner. Which which will create\neven more and deadlier Nik Cruzs.\nAutocracy goes on and nothing changes\nexcept the body count and the prison\npopulation. \n\nI got a better idea: just make it\nillegal to be unpopular, ship them from the\nmaternity ward straight to the chain\ngang and skip the formalities of\nschool, abuse, judge and jury., 3 Who cares if Kim Jong-un gets a nuke?  Nukes don't kill people... PEOPLE kill people!\n\n.... see how silly stupid that sounds?, 3 Donald Trump cynically proclaims \"We will be making our schools safer.\" It is not simply the schools. It is our churches, movie theaters, shopping malls, homes, apartments, restaurants, shops, concerts, hotels, and, of course ,the streets. Every person is a potential killer and every person is a potential victim. As the father of a victim said, \"It is unfathomable. We are broken.\" As the students of Parkland said, \"NO MORE GUNS!!!\" 849 people have been shot and killed since 2009. In what other country is this insanity protected by the government?\n\nTo Congress: You are more deadly than ISIS, Al Quaeda, Hezbollah, Jihadists, and the Taliban times 1000. Americans are the terrorists, not immigrants! , 3 Our politicians need to stop creating their own theories. The fact is stricter gun control= less gun violence. You simply have to look at other civilized countries that have addressed the problem. Metal detectors do not remove deadly weapons. And the NRA would suggest arming everyone with a 357 would solve the problem. I think a 5-year-old would tell you no Assualt weapons= No civilians killed with assault weapons. I will personally research the contact information of every senator, and political representative who received payoffs from the NRA or supports their agenda and let them know the blood of our children is on their hands. It's almost more sickening that the tragedy to read McCains and others condolences when they received millions from the NRA., 3 \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon.\u201d Well, that tells you all you need to know about the state of this country., 3 NYT shame on you.  Are you guys really so uninformed?  Why would you mention an Instagram account that was created hours after the school shooting took place?  Obviously it is a fake account created by some slimy little snake with an agenda.  Hell bent on stirring the pot.  He was NOT wearing a \"make america great again\" hat.  That pic reportedly isn't even him.  This account was made AFTER the shooting.  If I can find that information, you with all your resources should be able to.  Come on guys.  You should be better than that.  , 3 \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\" but there should have been laws against the procurement of this kind of weapon, as there were in the past., 3 The truth is that innocent people need to protect themselves from gun owners - though not with force (because then the gun owner HAS to \"stand their ground\" and kill them) - they can only run away or wear protective clothing, or live in a fortress and never answer the door.  Gun owners have the right to not only be armed, but also to have as many weapons as they want, including semi-automatic AR-15 rifles that have little or no application outside of mass shootings.  I've been hunting, including deer hunting, and no one needs an AR-15 or any other semi-automatic weapon to hunt animals.  These guns are made to kill PEOPLE - lots of people in a very short time period. That's their real application, though the NRA always claims they're for hunters, which is a blatant lie, unless they're hunting people., 3 Speaker Ryan...here are the \u201cfacts and data\u201d...17 young people violently murdered in a bucolic school with a semi-automatic weapon in the hands of a killer who legally purchased it. How do you sleep at night with all of that NRA blood money on your hands?! You are a disgrace! , 3 There's evidence that proper gun control works. As America's we should stive adhere and improve upon models that work.  With gun legislation, education and healthcare. \n\nhttps://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/, 3 A mental health issue??\n\nHundreds of thousands of Americans have mental health issues. Some are recognized as such but many others who are disturbed are not known to be so.\nMost disturbed people do not commit violence against society. Others who do, do not have what would be conventionally considered mental health issues.\nAnd even recognizing such issues does not predict behavior. If someone is not an imminent threat to himself or others, he cannot be lawfully detained.\n\nNo, the real issue is the easy availability of guns in the United States and the corrupt and specious interpretation of the 2nd Amendment by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Court cannot be fired, but assault weapons in private hands can be outlawed;  allowable firearms can be controlled by mandating licensure with training requirements; guns and ammunition can be labeled;  and Republicans who almost universally support and are supported by the NRA can be voted out of office.\n\nMental health issues do not kill school children and other human beings.\nBut guns do!\n\nWho cares what a killer's motivation is?  Killings of other human beings is never rational.  Let us care about the instrument used to create these killing----GUNS---and enact sensible public haealth safety legislation to keep our children and loved ones safe.\n\nThere is absolutely no justification to argue that someone's \"right\" to own firearms supercedes the right of all human beings to be alive and to live without fear of being senselessly slaughtered., 3 \"'But in an interview on WIBC radio on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that public policymakers \u201cshouldn\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.'\u201d \n\nSeriously? The knee-jerk of Republicans is that no gun control can be enacted, ever. Have they even banned bump stocks? They had a bill, but they haven't moved it., 3 Bottom line is people are going to FIND a way to get a gun whether there are gun laws in place or not. Drug addicts FIND a way to get drugs. Inmates FIND a way to smuggle items into prisons. Where there is a WILL, there is a WAY. Stop blaming gun control and blame the fact this kid showed signs that something was wrong and NO ONE did anything. , 3 No one should expect sympathy for their murdered child from Paul Ryan. He's been consistent with his platitudes but he refuses to help create better laws protecting people especially schools children from a mass killing gunman like Cruz. I don't think he's even uttered one word on helping in this area at all. \n\nPaul Ryan is not going to lead the Republicans to work on common sense gun laws. \n\nRyan's collected the most money than all the members in Congress who've been recipients of the NRA and Gun organizations donations. \n\nMoney over The People. It rears its ugly head, time and time again. It's at the bottom of how/why Congress members make laws and how they govern and how they run their campaigns. Their concern is keeping their seats in Congress and raising money...NOT saving anyone from a mass gunman on the loose killing anything in his path with an AK-15 at 19 yrs old. , 3 The NRA is an enabler of domestic terrorism. This isn't strictly about mental illness, it's about America's sick gun culture. , 3 Paul Ryan, we can't look \" at all the facts and the data\" because your party was bribed by the NRA to prohibit the very collection of data on gun violence.  \n\nYou are a filthy, murderous hypocrite who is unfit to wipe the boots of the children you have personally enabled killing.\n\nYou need to publicly apologize and resign., 3 He's autistic-liked to hurt and kill animals first....then onto humans, 3 When I read Paul Ryan's remarks, I'm reminded of what a sniveling coward he is., 3 No conceivable thoughts or possible prayers can make this better. \n\nI used to cry for each of these incidents, read the names and stories of the victims, then say \"Thank god, it wasn't my family's school/club/concert.\" Maybe call my Congressional representatives and sign a few petitions. \n\nNow I'm saying \"When will it happen to us?\" And now I need to step up, into action, before death lands at our door. , 3 First, there's something about Americans and their guns. I'm no shrink but I know there's something about guns which fascinate a lot of people. 60-65 years ago, as a kid, I sometimes would watch Saturday afternoon movies (from the 1930's!) of cowboys shooting each other. Even my parents gave me cap guns for Christmas! The movies have always had  plenty of gun violence. There have always been plenty of war movies with very graphic scenes of death by gunshots. We played \"war\" in the park with each other. \n\nWhen you think about it, you realize guns are omnipresent in the lives of most all of us. Of course, the gun manufacturers have always played up the \"romance\" of the macho guy toting his weapons in pursuit of some animal or other. (Just pick up an issue of \"Guns and Ammo\" or any of the other outdoor magazines. The ads tell the story.) So, maybe when nut cases like these shooters snap, guns are the first thing they turn to, in order to feel powerful. \n\nSecond, in this country, money is EVERYTHING. Money rules this nation to the degree that we are willing to sacrifice our kids so that gun manufacturers can sell their product. Forget ethics. Forget common sense. Forget death and mayhem. From the beginning it's always been about money. \n\nThat is the unvarnished truth. , 3 Congress has such strict safety protocols in place that they NEVER have to go to work and worry that a gunman will appear and start shooting at them, and accordingly, they are completely unable to relate to what the rest of us have to deal with everyday: the knowledge that at any point in the day, by simply going to school or work, or running into Target to pick up a gallon of milk, some maniac with an automatic weapon could walk in and start shooting at us. They can't relate so they have no incentive to pass any legislation making the lives of their consituents safer., 3 In the hallways...in the movie theaters...in the church pews...under the desks...in the closets...under staircases...around the musical stage...up the stairs...down the stairs...out the windows...after the bell rings...before the bell rings...as the prayers are said...as the band tunes up...as the alarms wail...over the walls...in the restaurant's freezer...near the baseball diamond...in the bathroom stalls...under the table...on the floor...against the wall. \n\nBelieve me, we get it.  Nowhere is safe. No one is spared. Nothing is sacred. Not school. Not baseball. Not the nightclub. Not concerts.Not the movies. Not church. \n\n Screw statistics. It doesn't matter how statistically rare gun violence remains. Virtually every venue, every place, every experience--ones formerly considered the safest in the world-- have now been tainted by the rot of gun violence, the possibility that at any random moment on any random day a loved one's life may end in a spray of bullets.\n\n Our paradox is that the society most obsessed with the illusion of safety is the one that casually consigns its own children to the possibility--however remote--of death by gunfire when they least expect it. That reality has become part of their mental landscape. We kid ourselves if we think it's not harming them. And that's the ones who survive.\n\nI'm still waiting for the credible, decent explanation for why someone's gun fetish trumps my students', my children's and my right to be safe. Still waiting..., 3 To all people in the United States of America:\n\nSeek peace.  We must stop glorifying violence.\n\nThere is too much violence on television.\n\nThere is too much violence in \"entertainment\" games.\n\nThere is too much violence in the movies.\n\nThere is too much violence in political rhetoric.\n\nThere is too much violence in racial rhetoric.\n\nThere is too much violence in regular human conversation.\n\nWe need to seek peace.\n\nThe Holy Bible commands us to seek peace.\n\n---------------------\n\n 7  And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the peace thereof ye shall have peace.   (Jeremiah 29:7)\n\n---------------------\n\n 9  Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.  (Matthew 5:9), 3 Has anyone ever asked why this happens? It\u2019s definitely not the guns fault it wasn\u2019t pulling him along the hallways. These \u201ckids\u201d are continually choosing to take their frustrations out on others. Kids who immediately afterward are recognized as mental distraught., 3 The only change that's needed is to get school staff carrying concealed at their own discretion.  It could be in place tomorrow; many of them would jump at the chance.  99.9% of people out there are the good guys, and many of them are equipped and ready to down a shooter before he kills 17 defenseless kids.  Rather than playing constant defense, the right should be pushing this hard.  If you want change, there's your change., 3 I've seen a lot of madness in my home continent of Africa but this is right up there with that same madness., 3 How about instead of investing trillions into a useless border wall, we invest that money into our schools by providing metal detectors and armed guards at every school in this country.  , 3 \"One of Trump's first actions as president was to undo a regulation that would have made it more difficult for people with a known mental illness to buy guns by requiring their names to be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Nikolas Cruz legally purchased the AR-15.\"\n\nVoters who value their lethal toys more than all these lives are responsible. Politicians who wage secret attacks on our government are to blame. And the people who fail to exercise their right to vote, most of all, should be ashamed. Who voted in 2016? 49% don't want to talk about it. VOTE., 3 Why do we care what 45 has to say about mass shootings.  When talking about the possibility of Clinton choosing a supreme court nominee to fill the STOLEN seat, he said, recommended, wink, wink, nod nod, that some of his followers might resort to \"second amendment solutions\".  And of course, the famous, \"I could stand on 5th ave and shoot someone, and my followers wouldn't care!\"  Might be the only truth he ever told.  We are in big trouble in this country, and 40% of the citizens are okeydokey with the situation.  , 3 \"He kills their kids, he kills their wives, he kills their parents and their parents\u2019 friends. And no-one ever really believes.\"   (I think quoting writer Christopher McQuarrie of The Usual Suspects.), 3 \u201cHe\u2019s sad. He\u2019s mournful.\" That sure doesn't make any difference. His \"sadness\"  will not bring back the lives of the CHILDREN he killed.  The parents who lost their children are sad. The parents who had to bury their children, when it should've one day been the other way around, are mournful.  The parents who OUTLIVED their OWN CHILDREN. They're more than sad; they're devastated. These children will not get to have their next birthday. Their parents will have to remember that day when it comes to the day their child WOULD have been a year older. They will never be able to celebrate Valentine's day again. He shouldn't get to feel mournful or sad, he's the reason for the pain in these peoples lives. Mental Illness does not excuse harming 17 children. Mental Illness does not bring back 17 children. Don't use Mental Illness as an excuse for the horrific crimes he committed. Hold him accountable for what he is: A terrible human being, who knew what he was doing was wrong. He deserves to stay in prison and live with the guilt (if he actually has any)  of what he has done, and how many lives he has ruined. \n\n(TLDR: Mental illness is not excusable, and he doesn't deserve to feel sorry, as he is the reason that families feel even worse. He deserves to feel awful.), 3 A pathetic quote from our nations \"speaker\" of teh house:\n\n\"But in an interview on WIBC radio on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that public policymakers \u201cshouldn\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\u201d He added, \u201cWe need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.\u201d\n\nWhat he fails to acknowledge is his own \"Knee-Jerk\" reaction by making such a paltry response.  There are plenty of facts and data - unfortunately.  Ryan simply doesn't want to deal with the issue because it will negatively affect the relationship of the NRA with congress.  And for him to even mention thinking less about taking sides and political fighting is pure hypocrisy!, 3 Get mentally ill people off the streets. Gun laws don't work because criminals don't obey laws! Guns are easily bought on the streets anywhere. They will use guns, knives, cars, bombs, anything to kill people. This guy showed warning signs for a long time. No one reported it. People are too busy caring about only themselves, especially with the computer generation. They are afraid even to call someone in person. All texting only., 3 First of all mind blown that a 18 or 19 year old kid can buy an AR-15 the min. age should be 21 at least, unreal. Secondly, made me sick to read the FBI was informed of this kid/guy last fall and did nothing, or said \"couldn't find him\"?! Seriously!? Every school should have a metal detector and at least give the truancy officer a gun for god sake., 3 I am noting with great interest that he is being shown enormous sympathy, that a person of color would not receive.  , 3  i send prayers to the family and students of  this  horrible  crime  my they be in my prayers, 3 Local Law enforcement said the shooter showed NO connection to a White supremacist group this morning after the entire media cabal said he WAS a part of a white supremacist group yesterday...once again, American media shooting from the hip not checking sources well and making up stuff that they want to be true, but isn't...\n\n\"On Thursday, Jordan Jereb, a leader of a white supremacist group based in North Florida, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had joined the group, but later Mr. Jereb said that he did not know whether that was true. Sheriff Israel said he could not confirm any ties Mr. Cruz might have had to white nationalists.\", 3 Boycott all national chain stores that sell assault weapons and accessories. Walmart. Dick\u2019s. Cabela\u2019s. Starve the Beast!, 3 I\u2019m not buying the mental illness. He was horrible human being. There was warning signs. Who raised this monster?, 3 \u201cshouldn\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\u201d\n\nHow do we not know all the facts we need? Kids have access to guns in the US, they use these guns to kill innocent children, many times each year. \n\nEither you're ignorant or apathetic. Either way, Mr Ryan, your time is up. Do something or take your NRA money and retire to suffer with your demons., 3 If former Mayor Bloomberg has already had success beating anti-gun control politicians, there is a template for beating candidates and office holders in that camp, and it is very simple, lots of money. I wish him or someone else with a high enough profile, would create or promote an existing fund that has a sole mission of throwing out of office anyone not in favor of the common sense gun control reforms that the majority of the public has wanted for decades. Follow that up with a relentless marketing campaign, and create a flood of cash that the NRA hasn't a prayer of competing with, and the NRA is done opposing the public's will and is broken for good. I would be happy to mail in a check today, so that maybe someday I can turn on the nightly news and don't have to hear about more innocents slaughtered by someone who shouldn't been allowed access to military grade weapons. Last, since politicians of both parties have been bought by anti-gun control factions, this is really an individual officeholder issue. Listening to them spin their positions is like listening to a bunch of lepers argue over whose hands are the cleanest., 3 Question: Before this killer was expelled was he referred for psychological counseling? It had to have been known, or should have, that his mother had just died. It was also known, or should have, that he had no friends. It wasn't a red flag that he was bringing weapons to school? Rather than just throw the trash out they might have tried some kind of intervention. That way they might have found out that he had an AR15 at home. And people wonder where the rage comes from. The FBI uses intelligence to prevent terror, maybe the schools should too.  , 3      There are those with schizophrenia, delusions and other psychoses that separate them from reality and who are suffering from serious mental illness and could be helped with medical treatment. In the second are those with personality, antisocial or sociopath disorders who may exhibit paranoia, callousness or a severe lack of empathy but know exactly what they are doing. Revenge motivation is, by far, the most commonplace. Mass murderers often see themselves as victims\u2014victims of injustice. They seek payback for what they perceive to be unfair treatment by targeting those they hold responsible for their misfortunes.  Having a mental illness does not automatically mean the person is at risk for committing a mass shooting or suicide. If true, half of the country in theory. Most police and military wouldn't be able to carry a gun i.e. PTSD ,Depression, and Anxiety. A better way of predicting whether someone might be predisposed to violence is if they have a history of violence.    It\u2019s very hard to understand that individuals do not have to be mentally ill to do something frightening and tragic. People who wish to own guns could simply avoid attending therapy.  The prevalence of high-powered weapons is an enormous contributing factor to the growing frequency and lethality of mass shootings. The call to address the nation\u2019s mental health issues is a familiar dodge of those seeking to avoid a discussion of gun policy. , 3 How did he get into the school? If my kid went there, I would have been asking that. Even though I don't have a kid in school I will be asking my local school district about this. This will not happen in my town., 3 There aren't words to describe the idiocy of the US gun laws.  We can and must change the law so as to stop mass shootings in the US.  Australia did it and so can the US., 3 First step to solving this problem:  vote these guys out!, 3 \u201cPresident Trump, we need action, we need change,\u201d she said, the urgency rising in her voice. \u201cGet these guns out of the hands of these young kids and get these guns off the streets.\u201d\n\nExactly and precisely how do you suggest that be done?, 3 Why aren't schools x-raying backpacks and posting an armed guard? Cost? When was the last mass-shooting in a statehouse? Politicians manage to protect themselves and find the funds to screen and check those who enter government buildings. Let's grant our children the same level of security. Screen every single person who walks through the door of a school. Yes, it will take some getting used to, and no, we don't like the idea of it. But, kids manage just fine when their backpacks are checked at Disneyland, or the DMV, and soon it will be routine.                                                                                                          Banning AR-15's also seems reasonable, but I lack confidence that a ban would actually keep these weapons out of the hands of mass murderers, many of whom meticulously plan their crimes. We haven't yet figured out a way to keep humans and drugs from crossing our borders, so I'm not convinced we'd have much success with guns. Either way, we'll be arguing about it for at least a decade, so let's do what we can NOW to protect our children!!! People on both sides of the gun control battle always repeat the same old talking points, and express the same outrage that this has happened again. Can we set our ideologies aside for a minute and actually DO something that will protect our kids in the short-term? Once our children are safe in school, we adults can get back to discussing mental health and gun control. , 3 Living miles away from the incidents of mass shootings, but I must pass on my observations.\nIn the UK we had several mass shootings; our actions were to reduce the type and numbers of gun that can be purchased, even by someone who can get a Gun Licence, you can get a gun or rifle but you have to have a need, the USA seem to believe more guns mean more safety. Generally members of society do not have any need for sub-machine guns and therefore we do not allow these in private ownership.\nThe effect of this is that the UK is very low in the world of deaths by shooting, the USA seem to have the belief that that more guns is the solution, the effect of more guns has put the USA death level per capita at the high levels at the other end of the safety figures with some of the highest levels in the world, in the same area per capita with relatively lawless country's.\nIf changing UK laws to restrict guns has prevented to date and let us hope it continues the type mass shootings in the UK.\nAlthough it will take years  why should not the USA start down this track of reducing the availability of these guns that are designed for mass killing in the hands of the general public.  Having more guns has not succeeded does the USA are you going to keep going the same way, if so you must expect the same result.\nI feel very sorry for the large number of the USA families and the population that will be directly affected by the loss of the such unnecessary deaths., 3 What gets me is this... When are we going to beef up the security in our schools? With metal detectors, a gunman wouldn't have been able to sneak an AR-15 into the building - even the variants with polymer receivers. The barrel, gas tube, and bolt carrier group all are metal, and would set off a metal detector. And in the wake of these attacks, why can't we have more officers patrolling schools? Heck, even have schools hire their own armed security if the local PD doesn't have the manpower! We have school security that mirrors the 80s, when we didn't have so many attacks on our kids! What good is a people that leaves their children undefended? I'm angry that the people charged with keeping the peace and protecting the innocent haven't adapted to the times. Unless we have people standing by to respond to such a threat on-site and measures that prevent stealthy entry to a shooter, we're going to keep seeing these high death tolls., 3 The ironical horror is that gun sales will go up., 3 A month ago, on January 15, 2018 two 16 year-old students in Perm, Russia entered a 4th grade class in session with the intent to kill as many children as possible.  15 children and their teacher were taken to hospital with various degrees of injuries. Four, including the teacher in a severe state.  The offenders later admitted that they wanted to replicate the 1999 Columbine massacre.  The only regret they expressed was that they couldn\u2019t have the luxury of possessing AR-15 automatic rifles like their American idols.  Thus they used knives and hammers.  They just didn\u2019t have the capability to walk in any neighborhood gun shop to purchase the means of murder.  As a result the total number of deaths zero.   All children and the teacher had recovered since then.  The perpetrators are in jail awaiting trial.  I wish this American perpetrator had an access to knife shop only.   , 3 Trump's wall and not allowing citizenship to DREAMERS will save the white affluent American children. The DREAMERS are more dangerous to the USA than any AR-15, Just look at the historical record. Everybody knows this. Believe me. Trump is our POTUS. He and Sarah H. Sanders wouldn't lie or without information from the American public. After all, their thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. The NRA and its donations to the lawmakers are not to blame. It's a mental health issue. Everybody knows that. Believe me., 3 So convenient he could purchase his weaponry at the friendly , neighborhood \"tactical supply\" store with same ease as shopping for groceries., 3 Too bad Rubio was just elected.  If his seat was up this year, there probably would have been a good chance he would lose his seat. , 3 Lenore's husband:\n\n\"House Speaker Paul Ryan said that public policymakers 'shouldn\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.'\u201d\n\nThis \"too soon\" argument hasn't aged well. OK, Mr. Ryan, we need to gather more information before we discuss *this* shooting. While we're waiting, how about the shooting last month? Still need more research? How about the shooting *2* months ago? Oh, still studying, I understand. A year ago? Can we talk about one of those? You pick the one. Have you done enough research on Sandy Hook yet? Come on, there must be *one* shooting for which you've had enough time, gathered enough \"facts & data,\" to discuss at length. If you'd assigned an staff member to research something 5 years ago, & they hadn't yet reported back, wouldn't you be a bit curious about the findings? If they didn't have anything to show, would they still be working for you?, 3 People in other nations always wonder why. In Australia, our last gun massacre was in 1996 after which there was a buyback and strict legislation.  Some suggestions\n1. Why not a march on Washington?\n2. Why not a consumer and political boycott of all those who implicitly or explicitly support the NRA.\n3. Why not a 28th amendment, the right to non-violence.\n4. Why not a gun buyback?\n\nWhy not., 3 Steven Paddock was on anti-anxiety medication where the negative side effects were aggressiveness; was Cruz on any kind of medication? The last thing the USA needs is lots of anxious students going to their doctors and being prescribed anti-anxiety medication that has a negative side effect such as aggressiveness., 3 Our Secret US National Anthem, or An Unending Tragedy\n\nGuns glorious guns\nLever-action rifles!\nThe end result is no fun,\nCarbines are no trifle!\n9 mm pistols,\nRich gentlemen have them, boys,\nDon't you want your own, personal missiles?\n\nGuns, glorious guns\nToo many are anxious to buy them\nToo many shootings a month\nOur favorite diet\nJust picture a great big gun\nmake it semi-automatic\nOh guns! magical guns! wonderful\nGuns! marvelous guns!\n\n-- sung to the tune of *Food, Glorious Food* from the musical *Oliver*, 3 As for the latest shooting - stop STOP selling assault weapons! Designate the NRA as a terrorist organization - it is financing a civil war., 3 You can\u2019t walk into a prison with a spoon, yet...., 3 It's time to start calling AR-15's for what they really are: \"Child-killers\". \n\nThe U.S society needs to start hearing the name of the most horrible crime everytime someone speaks about or buys one of those guns. \"AR-15\" doesn't hit any nerve, but \"Child-killer\"?... that does.\n\nThis is a real proposition, dear NYtimes. You can start this revolution. , 3 Of course, Trump won't say anything about gun control or guns in general.  The NRA was used as transfer point for illegal Russian money to fund the campaign of this illegitimate and illegal president., 3 \"A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in., 3 i bet this tragedy will be forgotten by mid or late next week. , 3 The NRA contributed $30 million to the Trump campaign, $20 million of that passed through from Russian sources.\n\nTrump does the bidding of the NRA and Putin.  No gun laws., 3 The mass devaluation of common sense. \n\nGun policy, criminal justice, climate policy, health, safety, conservation.  \n\nMasses of statistics, the consensus of physical science, of social science, of reason, none of it embarrasses a Congress that values the NRA, the Corrections Corporation, or Exon more than making sense, more than human life, or even the lives of cities.   \n\nSomeone posted the figures the NRA had given to wolve's tears pols who were offering \"thoughts and prayers\" last night.  It's a lot, but really, for the value, it's such a paltry sum, that lobbyists give them. Can't we just establish an evil grift fund for dishonest Senators, to inoculate ourselves?  Probably wouldn't work: the fun for sociopaths is in the fleecing.  And Trump is hardly the only one.\n\nCommon sense is outfoxed, outmoded.  An argument for common sense is based upon a false premise now, that these people are interested in doing the right thing, or even investigating what it is.\n\nYou notice, watching them at times like this, how fully prepared they are, to be utterly ridiculous, as if that were an oath they took.  , 3 How could his parents not have known that he was this insane?\nHow could the school not know that he was insane? The students knew and knew he had guns. Mental health funding some day. Ok sure but how\u2019d the system not get him on the grid? Antisocial and scaring people his whole life. His parents must be aware., 3 The fact that people knew he was killing animals was enough for them to report him to the police.  Why didn't they do that?, 3 When are we going to get consensus on the idea that AR-15s have no business in civilian hands?  And at what point do we start saying that the people traumatized by these weapons matter, by striving to minimize the number who must join them in the future?  So that this crazy 18 year old could buy a military weapon, the cost is hundreds of traumatized children, hundreds of not thousands of traumatized parents, teachers, community members. More every day, and politicians who ignore this are just plain heartless and should be tossed from office at the first opportunity. , 3 It seems we need increased funding for mental health care and the same for an accounting method, at least, to keep assault rifles out of the hands of those who may not have the ability to be responsible with them.\n\nTrump: \"Let Obamacare fail; it'll be a lot easier.\" . .\"We're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.\"\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-...\n\nA look into NRA campaign funding:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-...\n\nThe people who promote the NRA narrative have, effectively, told us that 17 dead kids (and numerous others in the intermediate past) are less important than campaign funding and NRA profits. , 3 The time for \u201cthere are no words for such tragedy\u201d must end. There are words, plenty of them, the last words of dead students and teachers who lived their final moments in terror and blood. And here are some other words of truth, \u201cGuns Kill.\u201d That is what they are designed to do.  What stupidity to say otherwise. And we, the living, must use our words to speak up for those that cannot speak any longer. We cannot remain silent or back down when people insist the 2nd Amendment was designed to give anyone the right to own arsenals. , 3 Please stop over-working these school shooting stories...you are better than that. Please treat it as a news story where you deliver the facts. Limit yourself to one follow-up story when a shooter has been identified. You have always been capable of presenting thorough and succinct articles...Just the fact please. Though it must be convenient filling a big piece of the front page for three (or more) days with tedious details from the most recent school shooting please give it a rest. If you are unable to find someone that can write about potential solutions for past problems then move on to a different topic. The entire global group of NYTimes readers will be delighted.  Your own newsroom staff will probably also be delighted.  Thanks., 3 Your president is deflecting Parliament discussion on gun control by raising the mental health flag. In times like this and for the past 1M victims in the last 10 years you need strong leadership to drive change. I do not see that in the president, what i do see is a president that is abdicating from his responsibility as a leader, parent, father, husband and selling his country out to gun lobby groups. Tell me Mr President how many times has a gun been used by a citizen to shoot a murderer? This answer will put it all into perspective for you and the gun lobby groups.   , 3 100% this was an act of evil!  No doubt about this. However, a part of this story that will NOT be discussed is bullying.  Are you telling me no guys or gals ever bullied this kid?  Degraded him as a loser? I worked with kids.  They can be brutal!  How many moms crying for justice really know who their kid is?  In order to be comprehensive, this needs to also be discussed. It is never an either/or, always a both/and.  How many parents are naive--this is the great sin, being naive--of how their kid said and did things to this kid?  Again...this in no way justifies his rage, but when a kid throws off a fire bell to get as many in the hallways as he can, that is rage & revenge!  Why revenge?  Those who walked by when he was being bullied and did nothing.  In a word it is emasculation!  An administration that kicked him out of school because it was all his fault.  There is another part of this story that will never be told due to the enormity of emotion.  I have worked with kids--few are totally innocent!  Most administrations eliminate the \"bad kids\" and this kid did not fit in with this community at all.  After his mother died, he was a time bomb waiting to go off.  He is guilty of what he did!  He might have rejected any and all help.  But I am not naive to believe he is an evil isolated kid with no justifiable anger.  Please..., 3 Our government has been captured by greedy, amoral toadies who exist only to serve their paymasters: the fossil fuel companies, big financial institutions,  pharma companies, and rich lobbyists like the NRA.  These entities are very big and very bad, and they are now pretty much the U.S. government.\nThe U.S represented humanity's id for a long time, but it was sort of a playful free-spirited id where overconsumption, narcissism and hedonism seemed amusing as expressed by American icons like Elvis, the convertible, Hollywood, Coca-cola... But now the dark side of those qualities are ascendent and we get selfishness, greed, ignorance - and the symbols of the U.S. now are mass shooters, destroyed and polluted lands, obese populace, t, 3 Can we stop calling these perpetrators \"suspects\"? He already confessed so let's stop with the PC nonsense and tell it like it is!, 3 Aaron Feis--football coach killed protecting several students was a conceal carry card holder and gun advocate--if only he had been allowed to carry conceal at his job--we trust these individuals to protect our children at school but they are not allowed to carry conceal on the job--this has got to change!, 3 Trump\u2019s response to this horrific massacre, and the response of most Republican politicians, is true garbage. What intellectually disingenuous demons these guns rights advocates are. Tell an adult or a teacher if you\u2019re in trouble or need help, President Trump? How is that teacher supposed to help when he\u2019s dead on the ground, shot by a student who\u2019s armed to the teeth? Our children\u2019s lives are turned upside down on a daily basis\u2014 lockdown drills, fear of attending school, stories of children being shot and killed bombarding our newsfeeds and TV, families destroyed by their children being shot accidentally, or on purpose\u2014 all so a bunch of lunatic gun owners can amass arsenals to \u201cprotect their property.\u201d  Well, my child is my property, and my body is my property, and your gun ownership is a direct and imminent threat to the protection and exercise of my right to  life, liberty and property.  , 3 Facts:\n1. We live in an uncivilized country incapable of protecting its citizens from shootings;\n2. NRA controls the GOP and most state legislatures;\n3. We no longer have a legal system that is capable of interpreting the Constitution based on common sense or  historic judicial precedent particularly as to the Heller decision;\n4. Anyone can get an AR-15 and lethal ammo with our government's blessing and have more rights than their victims;\n5. NRA siphoned tens of millions of  illegal Russian money  to the GOP and Trump in 2016 to help him get elected and GOP is trying to impede an FBI investigation;\n6. NRA is a terror enabling organization;\n7. For national security reasons, the Government needs to shut down the NRA and ban all ads and contributions by it.\n8. for same reasons government  needs to ban all pictures and portrayals of shooters and  publication of their names;\n9. NRA enabler in the White House needs to removed so that security of country can be restored., 3 Typical psychopath...slaughter innocents...then go have a meal. Police are \"searching for a motive\"...WHY? What's to understand? Angry disturbed young man who displays all the warning signs of a mass killer...goes on a killing spree. \n\nThe only this to \"understand\" is \"why do we as a society keep enabling this inevitable outcome, of yet another angry young man getting access to a human killing machine\"?, 3 I'm glad to see the level of outrage in these comments is increasing with each massacre du jour.  Outrage is the correct response to the problem you've got there.  Being reasonable, thoughtful, politic, understanding, balanced, introspective, tolerant, prayerful, sympathetic, pragmatic, sincere ... *venal and cowardly* haven't gotten you anywhere.  Your country is dying and you're all arguing about what color socks it should wear at the wake. , 3 He was photographed wearing a MAGA hat...anyone shocked? GOP = Guns over people, 3 When are we going to stop talking about keeping mentally disoriented people from obtaining assault weapons and realize that, outside of the military, the desire to own one of these killing machines is in fact de facto evidence of mental disorientation? To put it a little less delicately, is it going too far to say that only idiots and the insane want to own these things? I think not. QED, 3 \"In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun.\"-  Florida is also the state whose Attorney General, Pam Bondi, has tried zealously to protect the state from the \"harm\" of gay couples being allowed to marry, and who oversaw attempts to send a 53 year old medical marijuana patient with arthritis to state prison for 10 years; for growing pot in her own basement. \n\nApparently it's fine if you arm yourself to the teeth and spray schools with bullets, the true danger to Floridians are gay nuptials and pot smoking grannies., 3 The NRA wants guns in children's hand, folks. Guns don't kill people, remember? So guns are innocent. Everyone should have them, maybe two or three, and just carry them around all day.  That's the NRA for you. That's the Almighty 2nd Amendment.\n\nGood reason to change that amendment, in my opinion.\n\nBut to the NRA and the idiots who stand behind the NRA: you're right; guns don't kill anyone.  PEOPLE do.  Which is why \"gun laws\" is a misnomer. It is \"gun ownership laws\", meaning laws concerning human ownership of guns.\n\nThat's what gun registration, gun laws and restrictions, gun checks, etc., are all about. To make sure human beings are being responsible, because guns don't do anything by themselves.\n\nBut humans are capable of great harm with a gun. We know this. Yet, the NRA and various individuals in Congress believe that your children have the right to get mad, go buy a gun, and kill.\n\nAnd they fight every day for that right, for that right to kill innocent people at a whim (because really, guns are for cowards)., 3 The FBI couldn\u2019t identify someone whose username was his real name. Why am I not surprised , 3 The media is already trying to paint the shooter as a troubled \"kid\" who has mental health issues, family issues and losses, possible fetal alcohol syndrome, etc. etc., etc. \n\nWe should NOT buy into this nonsense. He's a cold-blooded killer who knew what he was doing and many people also knew what he was about and some(including fellow students) could foretell what he was capable of doing.\n\nNo sympathy for this animal. None. I don't care how many shrinks testify on his behalf. No sympathy ever., 3 Trump is absolutely correct when he says the murderer was mentally ill:  it turns out he often wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat., 3 Congress is not capable of doing anything. At the state level there should be a requirement that all school doors be locked during the day and that students be required to pass through metal detectors. Coats should be removed, and book bags and other large items should be banned or at least subject to inspection. Generally the urban schools are far ahead of the suburban schools when it comes to security. I realize these precautions make a school look more like a prison than a place of learning, but what is the alternative?, 3 Take metal detectors out of Capitol and reinstall when every public school in America is also equipped. No American child can concentrate in potential combat zone. , 3 Only Putin can solve the gun madness ? At this point anything should be tried . , 3 Take note legislators. These young people are begging for your help to curb gun violence. They are the future and future voters. Listen to them not to the money the gun lobby and the money thrown at you by them. Otherwise THEY will vote you out., 3 \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\u201d\n\nOnly the laws of Common Sense! , 3 If the shooter had been a member of ISIS instead of a white supremacist group, the talk from Trump wouldn't be about his mental health but about terrorism and illegal immigrants (regardless of the shooter's place of birth). My thoughts and prayers are for voters to remove the obstructionists of real debate on gun control from the levers of government., 3 If \"insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results\"; then are we an insane country?, 3 I wonder if it was the Psychology Department dimwits that were in on the bullying and tell the teachers to not allow him into a classroom with a backpack on and caused extra bullying and stress in the students life before he was expelled.\nJust because a person is a psychologist or studies psychology doesn't mean they are mentally or emotionally stable. All it means is that they passed an academic exam.\nMaybe just ban all guns from schools and put in metal detectors then the paranoid and budding psychologists with an obsessive compulsive disorder about mental illnesses won't be able to cause trouble and start a witch hunt on students they are bullying. Honestly! By telling a school not to let in a person with a backpack because of what they might do is auto suggestion even if the person never thought of it in the first place., 3 Nothing significant has occurred to limit the availably of firearms in the 6 years since 20 little kids were massacred in Newtown CT.  I naively believed that after Sandy Hook that something would finally be done.  I now realize that this is just the world (country) we live in and that nothing will ever be done., 3 This is not about mental illness or bad upbringings it\u2019s ASSAULT WEAPONS and the ACCESS to ALL GUNS at a cheap price and without a license and training. Shame on the NRA., 3 Once again, this is about guns and a very poisonous gun culture. It is also about fear, which the NRA and those who have been corrupted by the culture wars are responsible for stoking. Fanning the flames of fear and ignorance has been their mission for the last decade. This is the version of America they\u2019ve nurtured. I do not accept it. Now ask the politicians and the talking heads who vehemently oppose gun laws, stop spreading vitriol, stop hiding behind the flag, stop all of it now. Stop talking. Look at your country. Look inside of yourself. What will you do? How will you help? What will you do for these kids and their families?, 3 Going by the number of school shootings in 2018 alone and given that nothing would most likely be done by lawmakers who have control of Congress, it breaks my heart to have to tell my four year old that she needs to be prepared to be terrorized and traumatized at places she considers the safest for her. In a civilized society, a four year old will have the privilege to live in her own Utopia, regardless of what was happening in the world around them. But given that what is happening in America, does not happen in any other developed or developing nation, our very young children have to be told to live in fear and expect a bullet at any time they step out of the house and be prepared to run for their lives. \n\nHow is living in fear in America for a family with school going kids any different from the terrified lives led by people living in terrorist infested areas around the world? , 3 All very well to say people who are \"a big problem\" should be reported to the authorities - but what can the authorities do?  Arrest the kid because he's been expelled?   because he's depressed?  They certainly can't arrest him for purchasing an AR-15 or scads of ammunition!  Report him to the mental health authorities for treatment?  How is that going to square with the Republican goals of killing the ACA (which, if I recall correctly, not only makes it more affordable for people to have health insurance, but insists on mental health to be one of the things all insurance must cover)?  Or Ryan's determination to cut Medicare and Medicaid (something that might provide the car an apparently parent-less 19 year old needs)?\nYou really want to do something to ease the pain of the Parkland parents? (and all the other parents who have lost children to school shootings)  Do something, ANYTHING, to reduce access to guns.  You could even start easy, with things that even the overwhelming majority of gun-owners want (there are lists of them everywhere, including the NYTimes).\nHow about you put up or shut up, Mr. President?, 3 Under modern education theory, misbehaving students are not expelled but empathized with and urged to follow their better natures.\n\nThis results in  stayng in school, higher graduation rates and school support for the student for what are often difficult  home situations.\n\nSomeone like this needs help, the removal of weapons and a supportive school environment.\n\nI always think of Dr. Benjamin Spock's adage: No child will attack the society that nurtured him., 3 Just want to repeat: I personally don't want this guy's name all over the place. Yes, if one really wants to know, it can be found out. But researches are pretty clear on this: constantly broadcasting the shooter's name creates incentives for this type of person., 3 I have struggled for over a day trying to process the latest massacre, not knowing what to say, feel or think.  What follows now is a well-established routine that we are all familiar with and needs now recounting here.  \n\nBut in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, I noticed that something has changed.  Most people ignore seem to ignore mass shootings completely.  The church shooting outside of Dallas that came after Las Vegas didn't even get a mention at my place of work.  Not a single person was surprised to the point of even making a passing comment.\n\nAnd then today I saw that Mr. Bennight, the individual who reported the most recent shooter to the FBI over an online comment, deliver the following quote on CNN: \n\n\"I saw the story kind of go across my news feed, but I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it.\"\n\nWhen I heard it, my heart sunk, finally being fully aware of how little we expect to be done or change in the aftermath as we prepare to go through the now firmly established routine that follows, only evidently quieter. \n\nThe only sounds that we hear now are tears pouring out of broken hearts falling on deaf ears and silence. , 3 148,000 Americans die every year from trauma.  The Nath Acad of Science says 30,000 could be saved by prompt first aid.  It's the Golden 5 Minutes.\n\nI'm not suggesting that gun access is not an issue.\n\nGiving every High School student a first aid course could save tens of thousands of lives., 3 If mental health is the problem, then the number of gun deaths compared to the rest of the world would say that some how the US has a superabundance of mad people. Isn't that a serious question for the lawmakers unwilling to tolerate any restraint on gun sales? Are we (10 gun deaths per 100,000 people per year) really 1000 times more likely to be insane than the Japanese (0.06 gun deaths per 100,000 per year)., 3 We have taken significant precautions against terrorists when we travel because they slaughtered us.  We must take significant precautions -- security precautions, guards and screening and whatever else that will siginficantly help our children from being slaughtered.  Reality.  No politics., 3 A kid who can't buy alcohol or a handgun legally can walk into a gun store in Florida and buy an AR-15 and multiple magazines and lots of ammo.  Republicans say it's too early to think about legislation to stop school shootings.  Since there is a school shooting every few days in the US, it will never be time to think about it.  Only in America, where the gun manufacturers and their lobbies (NRA et al.) run the Congress and Presidency., 3 The Red Flags on this kid were everywhere. Even kids at the school were aware of him. The school authorities must have thought, they expelled him our job is over. I'd blame the entire school district for not implementing a strategy that, whenever any kid is expelled they're checked out and forwarded to authorities who should do further checks when the kid has the kind of background and evidence this kid had. Its just a lack of motivation, complacency that doesn't attend to the obvious. From the governor on down to the school superintendent this could have been avoided if only they cared enough or just were intelligent enough to ... figure it out. Trump just wishes it would go away and onto the next thing since his beloved NRA and Congress isn't motivated to compromise towards better regulations and background checks ... yes I blame republicans. They got their tax break, everything else is just ignoring doing what's right. , 3 While I concur with many of the comments on this thread, there is a vast number of folks out there who believe that every school should hire three heavily armed guards from the pool of unemployed vets and police officers. Remember, the overwhelming majority of Americans don't read the Times, or such responsible publications! Like Trump, McConnel, and Ryan, it's like the prevalence of assault Rifles, have nothing to do with the carnage! Amazing and surreal, but that's the reality!!! (And no mention of where was that armed guard who was at the school.), 3 How in God's name is it possible for a 19 year old student to purchase an assault rifle, but not a glass of beer?  How is it possible that my wife who sews cannot board a plane with a pair of 1 1/2\" thread clippers but a teenager with ties to a white supremacist group can enter a school with a semiautomatic weapon? How is it possible that (at least sometimes, and in some ways) Congress can pass legislation to protect endangered species and their habitat, but we can find no way to protect children in school. And why is that the newspapers descend on stories of mass shootings in school when gun violence outside of schools kills or injures tens of thousands across the country every year without prompting any outrage anywhere in this country ever. , 3 Jeff Sessions:  \"He added that the Justice Department was prepared to enforce existing gun laws.\"  That's pretty fun*&amp;ng hysterical, with an Administration fighting tooth and nail to eradicate all gun laws.  Rather than creating some common sense regulations, there are bills in  Republican state houses to further erode individual state's rights to enact their own restrictions- which has been upheld by the SCOTUS.  Meanwhile, I read that FL is readying a bill that will eliminate restrictions on carrying guns in schools, churches, etc.   , 3 You want to hunt or target shoot? There's no reason you need more than a single shot for either of those. The target isn't going anywhere whilst you reload and the animals for miles around are all gone once you've fired one off... No weapon available to the public should hold more than a single shot... You really feel the need to handle more - go join the reserves and be part of the \"well ordered militia\".. , 3 I thought I would try and understand the other side\u2019s view and found this reasonable position on Fox News. I would be happy for violence in video games and movies to be restricted if that meant conservatives would be open to restricting assault weapons.  As a parent, I would accept that. Would you?\n\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/02/15/liz-peek-after-florida-shootin..., 3 How come Ryan doesn't have all the facts? Everyone else has all the facts.\n\nHow can Ryan see and listen to the anguish of that mother who just lost her 14-year-old daughter and speak glibly about knee-jerk reactions and pulling together?\n\nThe aftermath of this horrific episode is truly surreal. You have Trump saying he will do whatever is necessary to help the victims' families. Oh, yay, lucky victims, Trump has your back. He can't help them; they have lost their children because of easy access to guns. And has he not made it even easier to get a gun?\n\nOh, and then the Florida AG tells the victims that the state will pay for the funerals. Oh, yay, lucky victims, the death of your children will not cost you any money.\n\nI just don't understand., 3 If you applied the Republican gun control position (guns don't kill people; people kill people) to the opioid epidemic, then Republicans would vote for cheap abundant opioids to be available to all Americans.  If people became addicted Republicans would blame their \"character\" or their mental health and not the freely available drugs for the problem.  , 3 In my local bookstore I counted 24 gun magazines. America worship guns. So I guess these school shootings are the little sacrifice we have to make to \"protect\" the second amendment.\n\nNot selling assault rifles can't be the option? Or could it?, 3 Is it possible to compile and publish a list of the members of Congress who have accepted donations from the NRA\u2014and how much\u2014so that citizens can respond in some meaningful way to their representatives?  ProPublica published a list some years ago of doctors who were taking money from the drugs companies and how much.  I found it very instructive., 3 Of course we need to address mental health issues as they relate to gun ownership, AND we need to continue to improve school safety and  security, AND we need to pass meaningful gun control legislation! ALL of these components are inter-related and solving any ONE of them alone will not make any of us, or our children safer. To again try to \"pin\" the problem on mental health alone is cowardly, a cop out, and undefendable.\nDon't let those in local, state, or national office who continue to do so get away with it! Run them out/vote them out of office!, 3 At a loss for words. May the wounded, and the parents and friends of the slain find peace., 3 Honestly, there is no hope to stop this carnage until we address the issue of private citizen's owning weapons of mass destruction. The President and the Congress are now complicit in murder for their failure to stand up to the NRA and say \"enough is enough\". Ordinary citizens have no need for weapons of this magnitude. When, oh when, can we ask our representatives to stand up for children instead of standing up for re-election? The answer is obvious; the courage is not., 3 I've known many hunters and gun enthusiasts, none would have a problem waiting a few days / week to purchase a gun\nThere is no reason for us to have AR-15 or similar arms available in our society\nNobody wants to outlaw hunting and personal protection arms....  the second amendment is not in danger - NRA and every representative that accepts their money and votes as NRA wants is responsible.  We have seat belts, insurance etc we can certainly regulate guns more....   and we don't need these assault weapons on the street, 3 Students and Teachers STAY AWAY from Schools until Congress agrees to pass gun control laws which outlaw automatic weapons and regulate all other guns and ammunition. Action immediately is the only way to make an impact. Start on Tuesday after \"President's Day\" to show you value the lives of US Children. Or continue down this bloody trail of tears., 3 Nothing changes.   For people with guns everything is a target. The more guns the more gun deaths.  About 30,000/year.  The massacre of the innocent, of our children continues with obscene regularity.  Somewhere there is a copycat  planning to vent his rage against the innocent at this very moment.  Perusing catalogues of semi-automatic war armaments.  Protected by the gun manufacturers and their NRA and GoP handmaidens.  Guns kill just as surely as people without guns do not kill.  It is statistically proven.  It snows when it gets below 32 degrees and there is moisture in the air.  People get killed by guns.  The gun people control Congress, the GoP, state and local government.  They say guns don't kill, people kill.  They say the 19 year old was mentally unbalanced.  But designing and enforcing legislation to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally unbalanced cant be done, would be un-Constitutional.  The gun people tell us the only  answer is more guns to defend ourselves from the guns they've sold.  More guns will kill more people.  Guns kill people.  People without guns don't kill.  Take away the guns or stop  lamenting the daily murder of our children.  Because between children and guns the gun people always choose guns.  They pay the NRA and GoP to be able to sell guns.  We pay in childrens' lives.  Dead children don't vote.  There are not yet enough dead childrens' parents to beat the gun people.  Must we really wait for them to outnumber the gun people?  , 3 'Secure our schools?' What does that mean .... let's build walls around them?? Trump is incapable, as is Congress, to lead on this issue. Before long the NRA will release some phony baloney white paper on 'securing' (arming) America's schools. \n\nOnly a society on the verge of collective insanity can embrace the logic that arming everyone will 'secure' anything but more violence, bloodshed, and profits for the weapons industry. AR-15s are not recreational weapons, anything with that sort of kill rate should be--as per the 2nd amendment--well regulated. , 3 And soon the predictable:  The GOP will fabricate anti-gun rhetoric and use this incident as just another vote-getter from their base who don't see dead students, they see an attack on their rights.\n\nSad but true, the GOP depends on ignorance and hate to win elections., 3 All Trump and the NRA care about is making money and pandering to their base. DT and the GOP DO NOT CARE about children or the mentally ill. If they did they would take action on sensible gun control rather than mimic grief and \"pray\". VOTE THEM OUT., 3 How a 19 year old can legally buy a battlefield weapon in this country beggars the imagination.  Approximately 1.4 million people have been killed using firearms in the U.S. between 1968 and 2011, equivalent to a top 10th largest U.S. city in 2016, falling between the populations of San Antonio and Dallas, Texas.   , 3 Mental illness occurs in every country in the world, yet none of them have this insanity where the slaughter of innocent people is such a regular occurrance. Think about that, a piece of metal is worth more than the lives of babies, children, and innocent people who are slaughtered too often in schools, workplaces, theaters, nighclubs, and in everyday places.  No other country even comes close to the madness here.  I can assure you, that even the most ardent gun supporter will be the first on line for strict gun control if it were their child, spouse, or parent that was slaughtered by a gun freak.  That is...if they were truly caring and valued life more than a piece of metal., 3 Trump blames surviving students in Florida shooting, charging they were guilty of negligence.\n\n\"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\", 3 What does it say about a country where an 18 year old can\u2019t buy a box of cold medicine, a six pack of beer, or a pack of cigarettes but can buy a gun and all the ammunition they desire? , 3 Hard facts. Harsh realities. In stagnation.\nOur government values guns over American lives and thus enables shooters.\nShooters in mass killings are men and boys.\nThese men and boys are broken, facing devastation at turn after turn.\nTo be broken is to live in a painful, loveless vacuum where lessons of hate are easily absorbed.\nHateful lessons abound, born of the sadism of slavery.\nHate must be taken down by love, now and before the next shot.\nMartin Luther King taught us what love would do to change America.\nWho will teach love to these boys and men, those men and boys at Republic of Florida, Dylan Roof's militia, and Richard Spencer's followers, the list goes on.\nEvery American can show up everyday and practice deep love.\nWe stop our society from destroying itself.\nWe deeply understand love, practice love, and teach love.\nOur government will then be able to lead us to values we can cherish., 3 Here's my SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING: I clearly see that this country glorifies war, guns, and the military. Cruz had been in the JROTC as were several of the victims. Does the military really need to start grooming our children in grade school? \n\nWe're the #1 Arms Dealer in the world. What happens to all those weapons? They kill people, including children. When are we going to wake up that this is who we are? We're violent but consider ourselves peaceful. The rest of the world knows all too well who we really are.   \n\nWe need to do some serious soul searching about the militarization of our society which goes beyond gun control and beyond our borders. Americans must start thinking of the effect on all those grieving families whose children were killed by our bombs who realize that Americans don't really cares about gun control or deaths of children unless they are our own.   , 3 Hearing the anguished interviews with the kids in this school, and those from other school shootings, I think the NRA and Republicans are going to be in for a rude awakening in a few years when all these traumatized kids start voting. They've had enough! They're tired of being sitting ducks, of prayers and condolences. Any teen who's reading this now, I suggest you organize a March on Washington!, 3 The First rights were adjusted to ban yelling \u201cFire!\u201d in a crowded theater, and threatening the life of the POTUS.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason why the Second should remain pristine, particularly in the presence of such a sheer abundance of empirical data that shows that increasing numbers of people are using their guns to mitigate every single perceived slight.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the kernel of truth ruining things for gun enthusiasts: increasing numbers of irresponsible gun owners.  Not those of us who want to see very strict laws or a repeal of the Second.  No.  The problem is that too many people default to guns, period.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican lawmakers remain cowardly, trembling shills for the NRA, preaching their \u201cpro life\u201d blather as they shrug indifferently at the carnage.\n\nA silver lining, if there is one to be had: watch the surviving kids as they interviewed.  MS Douglas High School is in a wealthy, literate-rich community where the average kid goes on to Harvard or Yale.  Those kids are the younger generations that are going to become politicians who either enact very strict gun laws or repeal the Second altogether.\n\nJust watch., 3 It is time to stop sanitizing the stories for us. It is time for each of us to be confronted with the images of this madness that we have agreed to as a country. All the words that are being written about this will be lost in a matter of days and weeks. If we insist on these horrible weapons of destruction as an inalienable right of being an American, well, by golly, show us the impact of their use.  START PUBLISHING PHOTOS OF OUR DEAD AND DYING CHILDREN.\nWe owe it to them to not sweep this ugliness and barbarism under the rug., 3 Mr Scott and Mr Trump need to publicly acknowledge that it\u2019s the easy access to assault weapons allowing this carnage. Mental illness alone is not the issue. 18 school shootings thus far in 2018 and it\u2019s only February 15th. Who needs an assault weapon in a civilized society?, 3 The solution is to Stop blaming congress and blame the real people responsible the this.  The Voters.  , 3 David Leonhardt today in an op-ed: Here\u2019s the truth: The teenagers killed in Florida yesterday had the misfortune of growing up \u2014 of trying to grow up \u2014 in a country that didn\u2019t care enough about their lives.\n\nSadly, I think this exactly summarizes where we are today.  At its root, this is not a story of mental illness, or revenge, or bad parenting, etc. It\u2019s a story of guns, money, and a weak American will (and I include all of us not actively working for significant gun control). Shame on all of us., 3 The sights and sounds of frightened children being replayed in endless loops from last night\u2019s carnage has to awaken us to our collective state of inertia.\nUntil we address our national state of trauma, acknowledge it and transform it into a higher state of conscious functioning so that we can look inward and examine how we process our thoughts, feelings and reactions we will not be able to get to the next stage of work necessary to cross the aisle and hear the \u201cother\u201d who does not think or feel as we do. When we can truly listen to one another we can find a solution that respects the rights of all; enact serious, sensible gun control, which does not inhibit the right to bear arms, but seriously limits the access to an automatic weapon.  We have to be able to hear, process, argue and ultimately compromise so that children are protected. We all share an overarching value of loving our children and wanting them to be safe, irrespective of our stance. Retreating into ourselves in time of crisis is a normal human event. Retreating as a nation and allowing our polarized politicians to retreat into one way and only one way of thinking is no longer tolerable.\nOur national consciousness is elastic and dynamic, this retreat is reversible. We share an overarching value of loving our children and wanting them to be safe, irrespective of our stance. It is time to demand a national discussion with the intention of clear action to stop the carnage now.\nEileen McPhillips Portner , 3 Now Trump is going to scapegoat people with mental health issues?, 3 Rewrite the Constitution, societies right not to be killed, trumps individual right to carry arms., 3 Sure...we all want safe schools and sensible gun control. Be careful what you wish for though.\nYou just better be very very very careful about implementing the \"strict gun laws\" that every progressive seems to be demanding. This is the USA people! Remember the \"war on drugs\". Sounded like a good idea back in the days of the wild west shoot-em-up Miami cocaine wars of the early 80's. Over the past 35 years it has morphed into a Frankenstein monster that has essentially placed millions more people of color behind bars and into the criminal justice system.\nLet's try THIS for an experiment first: Mandatory jail time for weapons possession in schools...and...only target white middle and upper class school districts. And of course...constant aggressive ongoing \"stop and frisk\" enforcement. See how WE, the privileged like it. The LAST thing we need is another tool of oppression running amok. , 3 Note to Donald Trump:  Every American high school has at least one \"disturbed\" teenager.  It's the nature of adolescence.  Take away the weapons. Pour billions of dollars into mental health care later.  , 3 The famous Carnage in America Inauguration Speech that so delighted the Trump Chumps across the country was partly correct.  We witnessed that Carnage yesterday SAD.  The blood of these children is directly on the hands of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, and Paul Ryan.  They have cynically and with great precision lead the Republican Party down this path by pandering to NRA and few wealthy families in the Gun Industry who profit immensely from the carnage on the streets and in the schools of our great country SAD.\nPlease no more hypocritical claims about mental illness.  Should we make excuses for the MS-13 gang because they\u2019re mentally Ill.  If I had a choice of a mentally ill person throwing a stone at me or shooting me with an AR15, I\u2019d pick the stone \u2026DUH\u2026SAD\u2026TRUMP.\nI have nothing against hunters owning shot guns and hunting rifles.  It would be hypocritical of me if I did since I like to eat meat.  Assault Weapons with large clips are another matter.  These are mass-murder machines and should be banned and made completely illegal.  We as a people should not be made to suffer because a small minority has an Assault Weapon fetish., 3 The real heroes were at the school. The real cowards are consistently MIA. As in, missing in \"in-action\". \n\nAnd who might that be? The GOP administration, congress and all other elected officials. Who obey their true first commandment. Namely \"we shalt obey the NRA\". \n\nI say a false god if there ever was! An evil god. The \"rights\" of the NRA should not trump (sad), should not over-rule children's rights to live. But that's the reality. , 3 From 1950s --- the famous quote of an appalled, fed up Sen. Joseph Welch who on natl TV finally challenged the despotic Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his defamation of American citizens--- Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?\u201d  A turning point.\n\nLet\u2019s say it loud and clear to our congress, the NRA and gun maker donors to our elections. Millions of Americans, including gun owners, now say to the US congress --- \u201c Have you no sense of decency left, at long last, Sir and Madame?\u201d\n\nSee NYT past op ed \u201cThe N.R.A. Protection Racket\u201d. by Richard Painter, chief WH ethics lawyer for Bush. \n\nSays, \u201cIf politicians don\u2019t play ball, their donors threaten to run somebody against them in a primary who will.\u201d Congress knows the rules. They and their financiers have sold a warped distortion of the 2nd Amendment to voters they\u2019ve conditioned over time. Now voters are seeing the truth, say the polls. \n\nSo the media must interview gun owners and even NRA members who want strong gun laws to help build a Resistance Mvmt. \n\nOur grossly deformed politics forces millions of children in schools coast to coast to endure cruel, barbaric risk of their lives. And all of us fear for our safety going to jobs, to shop, to live in our towns. \n\nWe the People of the USA are fed up----with corporate money manipulating politics, so guns became a respectable affirmation of American Freedom, instead of a threat to our lives that contradicts any civilized society.  , 3 No More!\nOnce upon a time (1968) there was a disturbed, disaffected student in my HS. Alienated, 'different'......disturbed, mentally ill.\nAssault weapons were not available.\n\nOne night he burned down the school.\nIt was rebuilt\nThe students in Florida are dead forever, 3 Today, no student in any American school can feel safe. , 3 I am so tired of thoughts and prayers!, 3 Let's see, Congress will offer \"prayers and thoughts\". As a parent, it is hard to see how that helps when your child has been murdered. I would rather they just shut up if that is the best they can do\n\nNothing will be done about this until either a shooter goes on a rampage in the NRA headquarters or a prominent Republican has a set of twins murdered in school. \n\nBesides, school security is rapidly becoming a growth industry. Soon, if not already, it will be traded on the stock exchange along with private prisons. Dead kids are good for business.\n\nReally, folks, how sick are we as a country? This is the fruit of capitalism run amok. Money before children's lives! Campaign contributions first, last, and always. , 3 As Ob\u00e9lix would say : \"Ils sont fous ces Am\u00e9ricains\".\nNot necessarily the shooter, mind you, but all those who oppose gun control and support the NRA. \"Fous\" indeed, collectively and stubbornly so., 3 \"deadliest school shootings in modern American history\"\n\nSeriously, do you need to say \"modern\"?  Were there any deadly shootings in ancient American history?, 3 Weapons made for use in Afghanistan are now being bought and used in America to kill students and teachers.  You should hear Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on Fox entertainment making condescending remarks about Democrats wanting to take guns away.  I'm sick with grief and I hate what is happening to our country.  , 3 No words for to express my outrage for the latest tragic massacre.  This country is truly broken..., 3 Does your Congressional Representative put the NRA's agenda ahead of children's lives?  Do your Senators?  \n\nVote.  Them.  OUT.  , 3 The message \"all our thoughts and prayers\" has been roundly criticized by the populace as utterly useless and absolute hypocrisy.  Pleas of \"do something\" resound.  Yet there will be nothing.  President Trump has made more empty promises to protect our children and wants to explore the \"mental health\" issue.  What utter vacuous drivel.  It is impossible to enforce anything related to a \"mental health\" issue when the NRA very successfully has been eliminating background checks of all kinds for assault type weapons.  The Republican Congress has been sheltering murderers and intends to continue as long as their campaigns are paid for by the NRA., 3 The Texas church shooter used an AR-15.  He also posted pictures of himself with his gun on social media.  He,too, was a loner who frightened those around him and was abusive to women & children.  In addition, he killed animals too. He was a white supremacist and Trump supporter as well., 3 \"Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said he would meet with state lawmakers to secure more funding for school safety and the treatment of mental illness. \u201cIf we have somebody that\u2019s mentally ill, they can\u2019t have access to a gun,\u201d Mr. Scott said.\"\"\n\nOh yeah, Rick.  That's NRA palaver, all the way down.\n\nSo much easier to determine in advance who's about to crack, than to keep military style weapons out of the hands of everyone.\n\nWhat derp!\n\nIf someone wants to exercise what he considers his constitutional right to deploy guns of mass murder, sign him up for front line duty in Afghanistan and wish him well.\n\nBut, for God's sake, don't give him the opportunity to take out his Republican vengeance on innocent high school students., 3 Multi-round high-powered assault rifles need to be banned from sale so they are no longer readily available to anyone in this country., 3 What do you want to bet the shooter is a product of divorce or a \"single\" mom just like the Sandy Hook shooter? , 3 All the wails and cry\u2019s for change will be for naught; here is the difference; years ago in Scotland, when children were gunned down in a school, Britain passed even more extreme gun bans than the tight controls already in place. The result, how many children are killed at schools in Britain or in Europe? Few and far far between. This country should just admit they love guns more than children, they love the second amendment more than their children. The second amendment is an archaic law from the 18th century written for a world that no longer exists. Go ahead gun lovers and those who cry it\u2019s a freedom issue, shoot whatever and whenever you want. And when the blood from your obsessive love is thick on the ground and you have no freedom from the tyranny of firearms, look around and see what you have truly gained: a dystopian world of kill or be killed, but you\u2019ll still be \u201cfree\u201d, right?, 3 It is time to sue the NRA into oblivion., 3 I think the less said by Cruz's lawyer the better. I doubt any American of any political stripe is currently interested in this psychopath's \"brokenness.\" , 3 Let's see if I have this straight.  A citizen informed the FBI that he had received a post threatening to kill school kids.  He even provides the persons' NAME.  Our FBI, who is supposed to take these things seriously and keep citizen's safe?  They did nothing basically.  They \"couldn't find\" this person?  Really???  I'll bet if it was one of their children at risk, they'd find SOMETHING they could do.  Let's stop blaming Trump and lay the blame where it belongs, on the FBI.  You share blame with the shooter by sitting on your hands, when you had the shooter's name and his threats.  17 lives lost because you didn't do your job.  Shame on you. , 3 Across the nation and next to every interstate, we need a \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\" wake-up call. Take the bloody emergency room photos of our school children and put them up, 14 feet tall and 48 feet wide, in color. Show the effects of an AR-15 bullet: bones turned to powder, body exit wounds the size of an orange, and missing jaws. And gaze upon the true carnage of our gun culture. It's time we face the horror, and then do something about it., 3 No sympathy for this 19-year-old man. He plotted and planned, amassing his arsenal and pulling a fire alarm in order to provide sitting ducks for his predatory degenerate desire to kill all the normal kids. He will be convicted. He has never been normal and never will, mandating he never be let out of prison. The courts  remand many violent males in America for crazytown psychiatric facilities but then send them back on the streets for an unsuspecting citizenry to handle, again and again., 3 First off, My heart goes out to those who lost loved ones in this all-to-frequent- yet-again tragedy. I can't begin to imagine the depth of your despair. Condolences to you...respect for them.\n\nNow I will apologise for turning this horrendous incident political...Republicans and the NRA will say: \"Now is not the time to talk about it...\"\n\nNow is the time, while these beautiful young lives are fresh in our minds.\n\nTrump is going to talk with authorities on making our children safe...and you cn guarantee it will be with a show of force of some kind. \"The only solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\" WRONG!!!\n\n5% of the world's population own 40% of the world's guns. With all the armies, all the wars, all the conflicts globally...almost half of the weapons on this planet are within the borders of the USA.\n\nThe old NRA adage: \"Guns don't kill people...people kill people\" is half true and 100% misleading. True, guns don't kill people, but people with unlimited access to guns will kill people.\n\nAmerica and Yemen are the only two nations without responsible gun control. Both nations are at the top of per capita table for gun fatalities. Does that tell us something?\n\nTo the legislators...and indeed the president:spare your \"heartfelt platitudes\" to the bereaved...and use your votes to curb guns. Anything less is a dis-service to these young people who are ow dead through no fault of their own., 3 Can we start showing bodies like in the wars (this is a war, correct?)?  People have a disconnect because we only see crying survivors.  They is no context.  Plus, it would remove all this conspiracy garbage., 3 I am all for more gun control as soon as the proponents of it such as Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Mike Bloomberg lead by example and disarm their security details. , 3 And our leaders continue to offer useless \"thoughts and prayers\"\n\nThe countdown clock to the next school shooting continues. We do nothing. We are numb. \n\nTicktock, ticktock, ticktock,..., 3 This US president is full of excuses... mental health. What nerve telling that to citizens who can't afford health care. The problem is guns, and him. The mothers and fathers of all the children and young people who have ever been killed by guns in the US must unite. If MADD can do it, so can they! It will not change until there is anger in every city, in every state of the USA. Trump - YOU are the problem. You're fired., 3 \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\u201d said Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami.\n\nIt's difficult to violate laws that don't exist., 3 So, is Russia funding the NRA...just a question....follow the money., 3 Trump, Grassley and Rubio, among other NRA apologists, said they need to address mental health issues. They were the ones who rescinded an Obama era rule that allowed social security to share with law enforcement about gun applicant mental health status. They can lie but they cannot hide their vote records., 3 Now we go through the candle-lit flowers and hand-wringing ritual--again.  This country should be collectively ashamed and might consider that this is what happens when voters elect cowards, idiots and snake-oil salesmen to public office., 3 Trump will apply bandaid to pulsating hemorrhage of heinous American Weapon Procurement System invoked for centuries. Enough!, 3 \"The shooting, captured on cellphone video by terrified students, has renewed a national debate on how to prevent more tragedies.\"  Duh., 3 1. Mass shooting\n2. Politicians decry one another \"politicizing\" the shooting\n3. Outpouring of \"our thoughts and prayers are with _____\"\n4. Gun control rhetoric and gun sales spike simultaneously\n5. See #1., 3 Some mass murderers are mentally disturbed. Many are not. The Vegas killer showed no signs on mental instability, for example. They just had a desire to kill, planned for it, bought their weapons and began to shoot., 3 I find it hard to understand why Americans can't fix their gun problem. It's as though you all have some kind of collective blind spot when it comes to gun control. The NRA, the First Amendment,the ole pioneering spirit of the West,self protection,these excuses are dragged out after every mass murder and you never do anything...crazy stuff.\nOther countries can do it (like mine for instance) so why can't you?\n\nThe poor families of these murdered kids and teachers and all the other past victims and all the future victims cry out for you guys to change your ways, so how about?, 3 I'm sad and scared that an emotionally unstable person can obtain weapons and shoot indiscriminately in this country.  \n\nPoliticians who receive money from the NRA should be forbidden from offering \"thoughts and prayers\" or concern for \"mental health\", when simple action will suffice.\nEdit (in 5 minutes), 3 We live in a nation with disturbing absurdities. You can't bring a Swiss army utility knife with a dull 3 inch blade into a government building or onto a plane, but a 19 year old can buy an assault rifle without any delay. Most people with mental illness are not violent, and some people are just pure evil. Let's stop conflating the two. He is not some paranoid schizophrenic hearing voices and pushing a stranger in front of the train. This guy trained with white supremacists, called an Uber, killed 17 people, and then with a calmness that should send a collective chill down all of our spines, went to Subway for a refreshment. That's evil. \n\n  What is really crazy is a nation in which one mass shooting after the next garners nothing but feigned outrage, fake sympathy, and empty promises that will be forgotten in a few days until the next tragedy. Too many of our elected officials take money from special interests like the NRA, gun manufacturers, to be able to carry out their sworn duty as public servants. And that too is evil by definition (profoundly immoral)., 3 Trump offers Help? Right. , 3 I've just read the profiles of the young people lost to this senseless act. It's truly heartbreaking, and underscores once again the national disgrace of our failure to address the scourge of guns. \n\nShame on the NRA, shame on the craven politicians who refuse to act while the national slaughter goes on. Shame on you all. , 3 Speaker Paul Ryan & others are quoted as saying \"now is not the time...\"\n\nExcuse me Mr. Speaker, but just when will be the time to have a serious conversation about gun control?  How much time do you need after Columbine, after Sandy Hook...??  Please let the American people know when would be convenient for you.\nSorry... but the Founders when writing the 2nd Amendment did not envision the rampant gun violence that grips our country today., 3 He is a home grown terrorist. Period. Mental illness allowed him to be radicalized.\nIt is time for serious gun control to save us from tomorrow's terrorist attack led by powerless Americans., 3 Cruz was radicalized by a white supremacist group. Why isn't that front and center in NYT coverage? White supremacist groups have been emboldened and elevated by trump. Why isn't that being discussed? \n\ntrump, conservatives, evangelicals, racists, and Republicans in Congress are all complicit in this mass shooting--in all the school shootings since trump has taken office. When are they going to be held accountable?, 3 Trump also exemplifies the bullying, gun culture, poor character, misogyny and white supremacy character that is the problem., 3 Wait, so this killer was partially trained by a paramilitary white nationalist group and then committed cold blood murder. Why is this not being classified by the politicians and the media for it really is? Namely, DOMESTIC TERRORISM. If this is not domestic terrorism, I do not know what is., 3 Making America great again, one dead kid at a time, courtesy of the republicans, the scalia 5 supreme court (Thomas, Roberts, alito, Kennedy, and the beloved Antonin) , and the nra, all of whom believe these terrorist killings are a small price to pay for all guns, all the time., 3 How about trying just \"Thoughts\" for an actual solution?\n\nWait, I'll just \"Pray\" that you will., 3 Why do people look for reason?  He knew exactly what he was doing and he's not at the end of the line. Obama tried so hard to end this violence and all his efforts resulted in Trump, whose waiting for a non-white to pull the next trigger.\n\nThis country is completely complicit! , 3 If an 18 year old in Florida can be deemed trustworthy with a deadly weapon, they should be permitted to purchase alcohol.\nAmerica is mired in perverse, needless violence and blind to its hypocrisy., 3 Advertising is a driving component in gun ownership! Has anyone remember actually see an advertisement for the N.R.A. or Colt?? No! Do you know why? Because every single night on TV you have shows that have actors toting every gun imaginable. Hollywood can't make a film without someone getting shot up and promoting it with a trailer or movie poster with someone branching a gun!\nHollywood is just as complicit as the N.R.A. They are the best lobbyists money can buy!, 3 Our fearless leader and his gun totting followers give completely empty, useless words in reference to this and all gun related disasters: \"... he would make school safety a top priority\" - wow, now I feel much safer. He also said \u201cWe are here for you \u2014 whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain\u201d. What we all need is a president and congress who take concrete action to prevent these more and more frequent disasters - more Americans are killed by guns (legal and illegal) than terrorist acts. They tell everyone it's a mental health issue so I think they (Trump, et al) should go to a therapist - they need the mental health treatment. What a bunch of sick buffoons., 3 Lets face some facts:\nIn the EU every year are 1.000 people killed by Weapon, 510 Million People are living in the EU and they change the ability to get weapon cause they think to many innocent die.\nIf i count Chicago, Miami and LA do i have 1.000 kills?\nSince 1979 more children died from firearm-related deaths as US-Soldiers in the Korea and Vietnam-War.\nMore US-Citizen (300.000) have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all wars in American history (starting 1775)and yes, WW1 and WW2 are in it. \n\nSorry about my english....it\u00b4s rusty and bad, i know., 3 \"The AR-15 rifle used in the attack was purchased legally.\"\n\nThat says it all., 3 Guess what?! Anyone who purchases an AR-15 or the like IS mentally ill. You need it for protection? That is pure paranoia. You need it in case the government goes rogue and starts attacking it's citizens - paranoia plus delusions of grandeur if you think that weapon will be of any use against the U.S. military in that delusional scenario. You need it to hunt?! Not only is that \"overkill\", isn't it a pretty good sign of mental illness when people kill animals for no reason. Plant something tasty in your yard and the deer will just show up for lunch. There is no legitimate reason on this planet for an individual to need that any type of weapon that shoots more than a single bullet. You're all cowards. And the senators who refuse to ban these weapons have a great deal of blood on their hands. It is disgusting., 3 Gov. Rick Scot of Florida wants to meet with state legislators for more funding for school safety. Are these leaders and legislators tone-deaf or willfully remaining deaf or will they just go around in circles skirting the issue.....until the next massacre. Why do they refuse to see the elephant in the room - GUNS! Every issue is thrown around that needs fixing after every carnage. Nothing happens, the loss of lives is forgotten... until the next one!\nLicenses, lock boxes, background checks, a wait of one month between 2 purchases, limiting purchases to 1 gun per month ( 12 guns/yr. ?? ), banning semi-automatics and ammunition and oh, treating mental disorders. This killer did everything by the book and so he can legally kill? Because that is the bottom line - license to kill! Frankly the US might be the only country where killing is easy because of our GUN LAWS. School safety? Sure Rick Scott. Call for emergent meetings, fly our flag at half-mast, cry crocodile tears, denounce the monster and the condolences prayers, comforting prayers...Americans are such sanctimonious hypocrites. They even let their own children to die. School safety? Why not just BAN guns? But that is a big NO. The NRA has to be kept happy.\nI'm sorry to say this, but I feel obligated. What would the reaction be if this carnage happened at Sidwell School?, 3 Maybe people should \"visit\" the gun manufacturers that make these guns and \"demand\" an \"explainatiom\" - they payoff politicians to allow this - and get off scott free., 3 Whose children will have to die before we bring down the quick and obvious curtain on this?, 3 Connecting the dots, there\u2019s  a deranged youth likely wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat who\u2019s a member of a White Supremacy group and violent towards females (and not only). Now let me think.... Who could have helped inspire this kid to go crazy? , 3 And once again the people of our nation with mental illness become the target of the finger of blame. , 3 There is no way this president can talk about mental health and guns when he bragged - bragged - that he could walk down Fifth Avenue, shoot someone and not loose a single vote. He wants to talk about mental health? He should get his own checked out first. , 3 \"He's just a broken human being,\" said Cruz's lawyer, as if that justifies or explains what he did when he took an AR-15 to school and murdered at least 17 people.  No, Ms. McNeill, Nikolas Cruz is a member of a white supremacist group and he is a home-grown terrorist murderer.  What IS broken is our system, for allowing people to get guns more easily than driver's licenses, and the worlds of the friends and families of those who were killed at the hands of this white supremacist terrorist. , 3 Where was the only armed security guard? He ought to have been at the only accessible entry to and from the school during class hours when the gunman arrived there? Doesn\u2019t\u2019t  the Times editorial office on 44th Street have only one street level public access staffed by several security officers identifying visitors?, 3 And the horror will continue; the morally bankrupt, slaves-to-the-NRA Republicans in the House just passed legislation that grants reciprocity for conceal and carry owners to those states that don't allow it. Great....now we'll have individuals like this young man feeling emboldened to go wherever they please to wreak their havoc. And yeah, it was done yesterday - same day as this shooting. , 3 If there are actually any Republicans out there who care about preventing these tragedies, here's some enlightening reading from the NY Times:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-...\nThis is why we don't have reasonable, responsible gun control and never will--the NRA owns the Republican Party.  , 3 Is the NRA a terrorist organization?\nThe U.S. Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as \"the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives\" (28 C.F.R.\nJust sayin'., 3 so Ryan says policy makers \"shouldn't just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\"  Do tell, Mr. Ryan, what exactly are the \"facts and data\" that would cause you to take action on gun control?\n\nAnd anyway, \"knee jerk\" is a ridiculous description.  if congress were to actually do anything ANYTHING about gun control, it would be a DECADES long \"knee-jerk\"\n\nGo ahead, Trump, take credit for all the shootings on your watch.  \n\nfor shame., 3 If you have the right to buy the gun, you have the de facto right to use that gun to commit murder.\n\nAmericans values the rights of gun owners more than they value the lives of their own children.\n\nIt's insane., 3 The shooter\u2019s ilk are Trump\u2019s base., 3 It probably won't happen under this administration, but I think it's time to start treating these paramilitary white supremacist/nationalist groups as a serious domestic threat. Back in the 90s, Europeans did not take seriously rising levels of crime among their Muslim populations, nor did they bother to properly monitor mosques that were proven to be promoting extremist dogma. Caution was dismissed as overblown and racist. Even after 9/11, the politicians dragged their feet. Today, there are now terrorist cells in Europe that operate like weeds. They are extremely difficult to destroy, because they took root a long time ago.\n\nThis incident is obviously not nearly as catastrophic as 9/11, but it's a grim warning of things to come. We should not make the same mistake. White nationalists are rearing their ugly faces yet again. We need to confront this problem now, before it continues to grow., 3 In a situation like the one about the youtube post, shouldn\u2019t the FBI be able to access weapons purchase records? , 3 Thanks W for stopping the assault weapons gun ban.  You just killed 17 people, most of them children., 3 I have no doubt that when future historians look back at our country, they will conclude that for a time America went insane. They elected a President that lies with nearly every breath, they allowed the mass shootings of children, they took health care away from poor people, and all in the name of what? Freedom, some would say. Temporary paranoid psychosis I would say. I hope the historians note that when the Republican party was swept away in the 2018 and 2020 elections, everything changed., 3 I'm listening to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida interviewed on CNN and the main take away I am getting from this man is to tell Florida voters to throw this man out of office.  The lies and hypocrisy is mind-boggling.  A typical Republican., 3 The criminal act was allowing a nineteen-year-old to have this rifle., 3 We're a Culture of Bullies with Guns\nOur society worships selfishness, fame, hate, violence, guns and bullies and we shouldn't be surprised we create monsters like Nikolas Cruz. The same sick values that created this monster are embodied in our national leaders and legislators who give us insanely lax gun laws. Even so-called 'liberals' who decry our lax gun laws are part of our bullying culture and it shows as most of them turn a blind eye to the bullying which mutated Cruz and other school shooters and leads to counless suicides by others who are bullied. Even the Liberal mockery of 'Thoughts and Prayers' represents hateful bullying.\n\nIt's obvious to me that we need much stronger laws over the control of guns, but there is a bigger point here. Our citizenry and our most basic values have become selfish, cruel and violent. Friendship has become a mafia, heroes have become evil, killing has become fun. We are now a world of bullies with technological capabilities never dreamed of only 100 years ago.\n\nPop Culture reflects our society very well. Christmas ads where the more , 3 Of course, Cruz bought his gun legally.  That is the only way the NRA and the Republicans would want it., 3 Another shooting the same response; nothing.  Americans have become a herd of violent, armed sheep, an oxymoron but I can't think of a better description., 3 He is an Orphan and society is paying for the sins of his parents who throw him on the street. He had mental issues and whole school knew about that but still nothing was done. The law of the land says that you can not do anything until the crime is committed . , 3 The question still remains: why did the FBI - who were informed about Cruz LAST September by a 37 year old You Tube video blogger named Ben Bennight, who emailed a screenshot of Cruz' comment to the FBI's tips account, and then flagged the comment on YouTube, who promptly removed it from the video - did NOTHING to followup on Cruz' comment: \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\" The FBI contacted Bennight right after he emailed them the posting, and they also called him right after Cruz did his shooting. But between last September and yesterday\u2026they did not investigate, do any followup to Bennight, they did nothing. What were they doing and what are they supposed to do? Maybe the Trump Russian collusion investigation was more important than preventing another school massacre? Who knows, but questions need to be asked and some heads should roll., 3  An unstated premise in the debate over gun control is that if some measure has the potential to save one life, then it is worth it. But that premise is not really used to shape public policy. \n\nWe could save some more lives if we built fire stations or hospitals on every block. We do not, because the cost would be high (not worth the additional lives that would be saved). We could legislatively limit the speed of all motor vehicles to 20 mph, but the cost would be high in terms of convenience (not worth saving additional lives.)\n\nGiven that on each school day, there are over 50 million students in schools, and each student would have no difficulty in getting a firearm, we are fortunate that there are not more school shootings. American schools should therefore be considered very safe places.\n\nCertainly, I am not advocating doing nothing, but I am advocating a very cautious approach. Whatever we do, we must be careful about curbing the liberties of the overwhelming majority of Americans who would never victimize anyone with a firearm., 3 One of the last major steps in the prevention of gun violence took place in 1996 when Congress passed the Dickey Amendment in 1996 as part of an appropriations bills, banning the Center for Disease Control to use funds to study gun violence. Since then not much has changed, the columbine high school and Newtown school shootings occurred, and yet Congress will not even enter into a discussion.\n\nAll we hear is that we should show respect by being silent as House leader Ryan utters the faintest request by asking that the public not make any knee jerk reactions.  And in this silence the NRA continues to fund Congressmen and women, as well as the present POTUS, who support their cause.  I support gun rights, but not the right to purchase an assault weapon designed for military use and not for personal defense, defense of the home, or sporting and hunting purposes.  I want to hear an intelligent and civil debate on viable steps to at least limit what the CDC should acknowledge as a public health hazard to our country's children- mass shootings at schools.  I want Congress to break their silence and act, act as elected representatives and not scared rabbits afraid of the NRA.  There is a disconnect between what I want and what I have - a Congress and a President that will not acknowledge the existence of a threat to the public and especially our children.  It is time that people not be quiet but hold our elected officials accountable., 3 These are the facts of life in America: Countless millions of humans will suffer from mental illnesses and emotional disturbances. The great majority  will never meet the threshold for being reported to any authorities, forget screening for gun background checks.\n\nHere's some more. Children will always gather in schools to be educated. Nearly all Americans will also forever keep amassing in places like Texas churches, Las Vegas concerts, Colorado movie theaters, San Bernardino workplaces, Orlando nightclubs and Manhattan streets.\n\nThese are the persistent facts of domestic life. They are undeniable and unchangeable.\n\nThe one potential variable in all this is what attendants beside us will be carrying. Will it be backpacks and briefcases and pocketbooks? Or will they bear legally-purchased weapons of mass devastation? To change this week's uniquely American picture, it's the one thing Trump can offer the aggrieved parents for whom he just pledged to do anything. It's the one thing a stone-cold Republican Congress can offer, other than those hollow  hearts \"going out.\" It's the one thing we can all push for to stop the anguished cries of fellow Americans., 3 Dear Mr. Ryan:\n\nGiven that these school shootings are happening every 60 hours so far this year, when exactly would be that window of opportunity to talk about gun control without the discussion clouded by tragedy?, 3 Children should not have to do \"Active Shooters\" drills in schools. No one needs the right to buy an AR-15. Politician shouldn't hide behind thoughts & prayers. It pains me to read all this madness every day.  \n\n\"But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still.\"\n\nI don't see the city anymore. You all have to stand up now before the lights are completely out., 3 The one thing that completely vexes my mind is why it is easier and legal for an 19 yo to buy a machine gun, or any kind of weapon, than to buy cigarettes or beer or have a drivers license? Why not have a minimum age to be able to buy guns?... why not demand to anyone that wants to buy a gun to have a college education and proof of employment?... Why not demand a proof of insurance, like we do with vehicles? I'm completly vexed, 3 It is a slap in the face to all the families who lose loved ones in these tragic and preventable incidents when the President plans to call a summit on school safety yet won't include any discussion of far greater gun control restrictions and measures. , 3 I have decided that the 2nd amendment is an old outdated right. If any of us really want change then we have to be willing to to talk with our neighbors about their guns and be willing to give up our guns. We must be willing to have very strong, very powerful gun regulations placed on us so that the rancher in West Texas can still deal with the snake or the errant animal but as gun owners we can no longer stand idly by. By not doing anything or saying anything we are a part of the problem. I am willing to give up my right to own a gun for the sake of teachers and children. I hope politicians who are under the financial thumb of the NRA hear me when I say I stand behind you with my vote and my small check towards your campaigns if you are willing to give this country more sensible gun regulations. Otherwise my vote must go elsewhere.  It is the least I can do to honor those that have died and to honor those parents who are heartbroken and grieving that their child is not coming home tonight., 3 A weakness in the US system -- too much influence of lobby groups., 3 The refusal by Republicans in Congress to address any elements of gun control amounts in effect amounts to tacit approval to people who are crazy. Why would you allow civilians to purchase an assault rifle with an extended magazine if there was no reason to use the weapon as they were intended? So Republicans in Congress by their inaction are saying in effect, yes, there is reason why you should have an assault rifle; yes, there us a reason why you might need to kill lots of people. Congressional Republicans have blood on their hands....and unless they act it will happen again...and again...and again., 3 We must oust and \"change out\" our do-nothing, NRA-purchased and NRA-intimidated Republican Congress., 3 A concept as oxymoron: Trump focusing on mental health., 3 This country is enraged! - Keep it up Mr. Trump and you will be out of the White House with your NRA groveling sycophants. , 3 There is a mental health problem alright, and it is this entire mad country.  We are seen by the civilized world as utterly insane, and rightly so.  We are insane to continue to vote for any member of congress who accepts contributions from the NRA.  We are insane to allow military assault rifles to be legally sold.  They should not even be allowed to be legally owned.  There will be an accounting for this one day, and the judgment will be severe, as it should be.  It is time for the millions of Americans who are incensed by this to come together to march on Washington in massive numbers, and to vote out of office any representative who has voted against sane gun restrictions.  I am certain that a strong majority of citizens feel the same.  If not, this is no longer a country in which I can live in good conscience.  It's time - for a lot of things., 3 Since Conservatives believe that the only way to truly be safe on a high school campus is to equip faculty with weapons, we should also be giving students Kevlar t-shirts since they are no longer safe from the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We are embarrassingly, frustratingly stupid and our younger generations pay the price for our greed, foolishness, and inaction. , 3 This is a mental health issue. It's high time we hunted these mad dogs down, not with a gun but with our votes. They take vast sums of money from the NRA and put weapons or war into the hands of people who kill our children... over and over and over again.\n\nHere's the ten most wanted list in both the Senate and House. Hunt them down mercilessly and vote them out of office.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-...\n\nShow no mercy!, 3 Kinda knew he might be an antifa or white nationalist. With this current climate im not shocked. RIP the students who didnt make it. Send this creep to the injection table. Make the world a slightly better place. , 3 See you all at the next one!, 3 his parents should be taken to court as well, 3 The Moron-in-Chief is also a coward.\n\nAs a person with a massively bipolar brain am am angered every time there is a massacre in the U.S. and the politicians who do not want to address the issue of restrictions on the 2nd amendment  and the sickness that pervades U.S. society raise the red herring of \"the mentally ill\".\n\nWhere are the politicians who will confront the ease with which guns and ammunition can be bought with restrictions comparable to every other developed society?\n\nIf the U.S. cannot find any, your children will continue to be slaughtered., 3 what a despicable bunch republican politicians are, starting with with the despicable-in-chief. the same bunch of lies after each of these shootings, mental illness this, mental illness that. yes, of course mass shooters are not well, but the overwhelming majority of people with mental problems don't go around murdering anybody. and the few ones who do would not be able to be this lethal if they couldn't so easily get their hands on virtually any kind of weapon they want. \n\nplus, if they really cared about mental illness, they might as well stop trying to leave millions of people uninsured, or with health insurance that doesn't cover mental illness.\n\nmost of these republican politicians are not stupid and they probably understand the consequences of their support for the NRA and their policies, but for whatever reason they don't care. they then go around toting their phony thoughts, prayers and sanctimony to everybody. i don't believe there is a god, but if there was one, she must be crazy mad about these despicable hypocrites who invoke her name to abet all this pain, suffering and destruction., 3 Your Senators\nYour Congressmen\nYour President\n   U put them in office ....\nand they upheld your right to have guns, 3 I wonder what it's like when a shooting victim or family member meets an NRA/GOP operative in heaven. I also wonder if God issues guns, and if so to whom., 3 Here's how to fix it.., yeah, here goes that 'Australia' thing again.\n\nAustralia USED to have a problem with gun violence!\u00a0\nThey had our 'enough-is-enough' incident in 1996 with 32 people shot up.\nA conservative (Republican) Prime Minister passed these gun laws:\n\n- Submit an application for a gun - 28-day waiting period. A reason for wanting a gun must be provided. Self defence IS NOT a valid reason. (So those who like hunting and farmers can still own guns)\n\n- Available weapons: rifles & pistols. Auto and semi automatics are BANNED.\n\n- To own a pistol: submit an application (28 d wait). You must belong to a registered pistol (gun) club and use their on-site pistols for 6 months before being granted the right to purchase your own.\n\n- You must provide evidence to police of how your gun is to stored - ammunition and guns are to be stored in separate locked containers.\n\n- If carrying in a car, the gun trigger must be locked and carried in the trunk - ammunition up-front - locked.\n\n'But what about the criminals?' you ask. An AR15 on the black market costs more than $30,000. The penalty is more than 10 years jail.\n\nRESULT: NO mass shootings since! No kids shot up. No lives ruined. No (glib) 'thoughts and prayers'. No 'we should do more for mental health'. No more excuses. No more BS.\n\nPrior to 1996, many yelled 'tougher guns laws won't fix it!'.\u00a0\nTHEY HAVE BEEN PROVED WRONG.\n\n... that's how you fix it.  No violation of 2nd amendment.\n\nTell your elected representatives - enough., 3 &gt; Mr. Jereb [, leader of the white nationalist group Mr. Cruz joined,] said that he did not know Mr. Cruz personally and that \u201che acted on his own behalf of what he just did and he\u2019s solely responsible for what he just did.\u201d\n\nSure., 3 #FreeUSfromGuns, 3 You all did nothing when 6 and 7 year old children were massacred. For shame., 3 Gun nuts can blather on about 2nd Amendment rights and the boogeyman of  government tyranny all they like - any private citizen who feels justified in owning a military grade weapon like an AR-15 and hundreds of rounds of ammunition needs a mental health intervention. America\u2019s obsession with guns is sick., 3 However, I hear the NRA is willing to pay for all funeral expenses. , 3 next time you florida moms and pops find yourselves in the voting booth pulling the lever for a republican, realize you are helping pull the trigger at the next school shooting..just sayin', 3 It's Florida, the state that will give granny a 10 year prison sentence for growing a pot plant in her basement to help with her arthritis pain; but where apparently any jug-eared malcontent can buy an assault rifle, no questions asked., 3 The NRA worships the chthonic;\nTo recall this requires no mnemonic.\nFor their right to bear arms\nWe will ever share harms\nThat make dystopian nightmares turn chronic., 3 Let's connect the dots....Cruz is a member of a white supremacist group, and the white supremacists supported Trump in the presidential election. A perfect Ven diagram, and another example of Trump's war on the American people., 3 Some thoughts on correcting inconsistencies -\n\nTrump overturned the Obama-era law outlawing guns for the mentally ill. Governor Scott said mentally ill people shouldn't be able to buy guns -he needs to challenge his president to re-enact the law he tore up. And since Trump said he'll do anything to help the school recover - he must condemn the Trump-loving white nationalist group Cruz joined and shut it down, and demand a bill on his desk to deny his neo-Nazi supporters the ability to buy guns.\n\nGovernor Scott's record on gun laws has made Florida one of the states most likely for its residents to die from guns purchased legally.\n\nThe bail bondsman said the FBI couldn't track down the YouTube school shooting threat BUT also said the FBI connected the threat to the shooting yesterday because the name was the same. Highly doubtful that there are too many Nikolas Cruz names to track. Yes, people can and do say a lot of things- but threatening a school shooting is not random speech. , 3 Congress & the \"N.R.A.\" have killed more children than the Taliban., 3 Shame on Congress! If this mentally-ill man had zero access to a firearm -- that has no morally-right business in the consumer market --1000s of people would still be alive. Trump's words of love are a joke IF he doesn't change the gun laws. Outrageous sham, these Republicans with blood on their hands. Change the gun laws now., 3 The only reason to own an AR-15 is to kill people.  If one was trained on Congress maybe then they would stand up to gun money.  But no, the lily-livered GOP \"prays\" instead.\n\nIt's a crime equal to the killers' crime., 3 Wonder how many of the parents, whose kids were killed, voted stands for NRA, Trump. Are they mourning victims or martyrs of their beliefs? , 3 This violent low IQ 19-year-old man is a good example of why JROTC and guns do not belong in high school. That's where he got his training. , 3 \"The F.B.I. on Thursday released a statement that said it received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel in September 2017. \u201cNo other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment,\u201d the statement said. The F.B.I. said it conducted database reviews and other checks, but was unable to further identify the person who posted the comment.\"\n\nBillions of Dollars spent on Homeland Security, the FBI, and CIA since 9/11, and they still can't trace a YouTube user????, 3 So there is ghoulish Pam Bondi, attorney general of Florida, which apparently is a paradise if you want an Arsenal, goes on tv and offers to pay for the funerals. So that's the trade off for the Republicans, you agree that your kids can be targets, and we'll pay for the funeral. And somebody needs to look into contacts between the NRA and Russia. Why are NRA members visiting Russia. Are Russians funneling money to GOP candidates through the NRA?, 3 Trump CAN help.\n\nHe can help by supporting gun control and signing gun regulation bills. Eight of the 10 states that have the strictest gun regulations have the fewest deaths by firearms. \n\nHe can help by condemning his white supremacist supporters and urging them to go back to their holes (and denying suspected neo-Nazis access to guns!)\n\nHe can help by bringing back the Obama-era law denying mentally ill applicants permission to buy guns - the law Trump overturned immediately after he became president.\n\nHe can help by demanding that his son to get off his pro-gun silencer campaign - if a silencer had been used yesterday, hundreds could have died in that school of 3000 children.\n\nGet started helping, Mr. Trump. Children are dying while you are at the wheel., 3 \" The president calls the gunman \u2018mentally disturbed.\u2019\"....\nThe kettle...  just called the Pot...  \"black..\"..., 3 We don't need to outlaw the ownership of guns - we need to outlaw the ownership of the Congress by the NRA.  VOTE!!!!!, 3 Gov. florida, president say mentally ... shouldn't be able to buy guns.  Did they check with NRA to see if they could say that?, 3 Why aren't we calling this young man a white supremacist terrorist?, 3 To the typical NRA member, whore politician, and gun manufacturer executive who all LOVE their military assault rifles:\n\"How many deaths will it take 'til he knows, that to many people have died\"...Bob Dylan., 3 So he was a white nationalist. A domestic terrorist. Will President Trump call for a ban on white nationalists? Will the NRA?, 3 It dawned on me as I read about this latest mass shooting: it will be the children, the survivors of these mass school shootings, who will put in place sensible regulations that will stem the tide of this violence.  They will, unfortunately, be able to speak and act with a passion and vigor no politician has today., 3 This carnage will never end until America has realistic and sane gun control laws. The only possible way for America to achieve this is to overwhelmingly repudiate the Republicans, who remain captive to the NRA. With both legislative control and judicial appointment control, America can begin to reclaim a sane interpretation of your Second Amendment and begin to enjoy a safer, more sane place to live., 3 Bottom line:  The voting majority chose to elect politicians who favor letting people with known records of anger-related behavioral problems buy guns.\n\nStudents should ask their parents if they're part of that voting majority., 3 I live more or less under the west-bound flight path into O'Hare Airport, depending on wind direction.  Since the Second Amendment says that \"...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,\" shouldn't I be allowed to purchase a Stinger anti-aircraft missile?  As it happens, many of my neighbors in this part of Chicago are Muslim, largely from South Asia and East Africa.  Should they be allowed to buy the missiles as well?\nIf Second Amendment Absolutists have an issue with a recently naturalized Somali or Pakistani living under a well-traveled flight path having access to anti-aircraft weapons, are they not acknowledging that there are some common-sense limits to that \"shall not be infringed\" business in the right to bear arms?  And if this is the case, then might not military assault rifles also be regulated? , 3 When people fetishize guns to the extent we do, when citizens feel they need guns to protect themselves from \u201cevildoers\u201d, and to stand their ground, it isn\u2019t a big leap for an alienated, disturbed person to use a gun to solve the problems and assuage the injuries of his own life; bullying, rejection, loss, emotional isolation. Go get the \u201cenemy\u201d with your gun. We need gun control legislation, a social safety net that promotes mental and physical health, and a new mind-set. Guns cannot be our default solution to injury and fear; we need to retool so we can envision solutions to problems that sideline guns. We need freedom from fear and desperation that doesn\u2019t involve packing heat. , 3 Gun owners should be required to show proof of insurance - and the premiums should be high.  Guns and ammunition should be be highly taxed, and the funds placed in a national victim's fund and/or used to assist  with mental health and other services.  We have gone after the manufacturers of tobacco and other harmful substances.  We to after car manufacturer's who sell unsafe vehicles.  We require citizens to have car insurance.  Why are fire arms exempt from any reasonable regulations to try and stem the carnage?  Politicians have blood on their hands every time one of these events occur.  , 3 One person's \"common sense\" realistic gun regulations are another's\n\"ban all firearms\" rallying cry. We see the whole spectrum in the comments section. \"Common sense\" regulation is not a holistic movement...the ideas are all over the place. \n\nIf these regulatory proposals weren't all lumped together in a slippery-slope package under the label \"common sense,\" then maybe gun owners would be more receptive in getting regulations enacted. I'd join in the cries for regulation (I have no use for \"tactical\" rifles and I'm fine if they disappear) IF I was certain that we would draw the line there. But group polarization ensures that the most extreme voices become the next threshold. , 3 I don't know why the dialogue on gun control mostly doesn't include licensing and age requirements for gun ownership in the first place? Just like we have driver's licensing and age limits for alcohol, nobody without a gun license and under the age of 21 should be allowed to own or purchase a gun, especially an AR15! If we could even get some consensus on that point, it'd be a great start., 3 Every United States citizen should be provided with the same degree of protection as are Donald Trump and members of Congress. If this solution proves difficult to implement (we may run out of people to do the protecting), the next best solution for the sake of fairness is for no one to have more protection than anyone else. After taking away the gun privileges of the mentally ill, Donald Trump and members of Congress should freely circulate among the people, trusting that people's thoughts and prayers will offer full protection against attacks by AR-15-toting sane individuals.   , 3 The entire country has changed to please NRA , and gun deaths keeps on increasing , is there a relationship here the GOPs does not and do not want to see ? Allow me to use the word trump\nNRA trumps lives\nGOP trump lives\nGun right trump lives\nGun right trump all other rights\nHow does one make sure there is no nuclear war ? Make more nuclear bombs and sell them ? That is NRA, that is GOP's mantra.\nChurches are not safe\nMovies theaters are not safe\nMalls are not safe\nSchools are not safe\nConcert sites are not safe\nAnd the NRA and GOPs answers to all above are,\n\" not the time to talk about it \"\n\" Gun control \" does not work \" - Like non- nuclear proliferation does not work ?\n\" Just enforce the laws \"\nAll the above talking points continues while more mass killings happened.\nWithout a safe education environment , we will fall behind the rest of the world ,certainly China.\nTrump's immigration policy have already brain drained this country, a lot of brilliant people have already chosen China, China is welcoming them because it is the single most important step to get ahead of US.\nIf all those NRA serving politicians believe no gun control, why are the not hand guns and  AR-15 allowed in capital hill ? They never have to experience the tragic death of a love one, 3 Every single shooting the same talking points are replayed back and forth over and over. How has this worked out for us so far? Increasingly, it is now fashionable (regardless of how inaccurate) to hold up the NRA as some kind of all-powerful boogieman, with some kind of magical deep state power. \n\nPerhaps, to some left-wing ideologues, this is easier to stomach than the hard truth; The NRAs only power comes from it's popular support. It's funds come from it's members. Often in small amounts, just like Bernie. The government contributions are a drop in the bucket compared to many of the lobbies in the country, and these are often wildly exaggerated to stoke self-righteous indignation. \n\nThe propagation of this stems from the \"mythical\" media bubble that makes it seem as if everyone in the country agrees with scrapping the second amendment (and they'd totally get away with it too, if it wasn't for that darned NRA!) \n\nYet, as you types should have learned in the election, just because your \"ideological voice\" is the loudest,  does not mean you dominate in the numbers you think you do. \n\nSo, unless anyone here still believes they can insult, belittle and lecture their way into political wins, perhaps the tone should be a bit more moderate, to reflect the realities of the voters beliefs. , 3 As a 19yr old, at least the Legislature ensured he couldn't inflict Mass Casualties inebriated as Gun Owner, by being able to purchase alcohol legally.  , 3 \"\u201cWe are here for you \u2014 whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an address to the nation.\"\n\nExcept, of course, to support meaningful legislation that might really help; legislation supported by over 90% of the American public, and even by many gun owners.  Except allowing the Centers for Disease Control to study gun deaths.  Except, in other words, to do anything.\n\nThanks for your thoughts, Mr President.  As usual, they are meaningless., 3 Here's how this will play out:\n\nThere will be outage from the left, the right will argue that gun violence is a regrettable byproduct of American \"freedom\", a scant few politicians will press for action on gun control, the NRA will say now is not the time to discuss gun laws, the President and GOP will focus on metal health rather than gun control... and nothing will be done to curb the violence... which will be repeated with another school shooting next week, and the week after that ad infinitum.\n\nWhen is enough enough, America?, 3 I get it, our Legislators will never have the \"collective will\" to make high velocity output guns illegal.  Then how about we legislate for any gun purchased that has any potential to become a semi-automatic or automatic weapon be legally required to be logged into a national database--including private sales--by the seller.  Also any ammunition that could possibly be used for any semi-automatic or automatic weapon also legally be required for registration.\nThis will keep the sellers accountable and we can then flag those who are accumulating weapons and ammunition beyond \"reasonable\" use and investigate from there.\nAt least it's a step in the right direction and it takes away the argument about the freedom to access guns.  \n\nEvery other transaction in this country is being captured (by every retailer) and no-one seems to mind at all.  Why not require something as important as this?\n\nWe need some organized monitoring around not just mental health but atypical weapon/ammo purchases.     , 3 To a large extent, this problem can be placed at the doorstep of the regulation advocates. They pop out of the woodwork when these shootings happen to call for bans on large capacity magazines, assault weapons, bump-stock devices, etc., then quickly fade back into the woodwork over the coming days. Meanwhile, gun rights advocates are working tirelessly every day to advance their agenda, fighting regulations, pushing for national concealed carry permits, writing books that present one-sided cases against the effectiveness of gun control. They are in the minority, but they completely control the narrative on this topic. There is a solution to this nonsense-go ask Japan; go ask Great Britain; go ask Australia. But until we can match the determination of the gun rights advocates, we can look forward to this spectacle again and again-not to mention the other ~30,000 deaths that occur each year in the US that we won't hear anything at all about., 3 As a retired teacher, I find Trump\u2019s simplistic perception a reflection of his class bias. He knows nothing of the nation\u2019s educational system-its demands and limitations.\nI feel we are failing to protect students and teachers. And until we elect men and women who will take on the gun lobby, our young and those who work with them are venerable.\nSuch a loss! So unbelievably sad and so unnecessary. , 3 !) My heart , thoughts, and prayers go out to the families.\n2) Painting a broad brushstroke on those suffering from mental illness is morally wrong. Those suffering from depression or anxiety are 3-4 time more likely to be a victim than others\n3) The time has come to ban all guns including shotguns and hunting rifles and , most importantly, bullets.\n4) the only way to match the power of the NRA is vote for individuals that will change the system\n4)The time has come to stop trying to find blame with this group or that one and work together to find solutions., 3 How can the people of Florida elect lawmakers who have so little regard for public safety that an individual whose erratic behavior had been reported to the FBI and law enforcement could LEGALLY buy a lethal weapon and ammunition?  What is wrong with these people?, 3 And when is this country going to start dealing with the out of control gun problem.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that weapons like this assault rifle were banned on a federal level. Now these guns have flooded the country and have been used at every mass shooting. \n\nThanks Republicans and your NRA money for the ongoing carnage., 3 Is there a national organization that is a counterpoint to the NRA? If so, it needs to be publicized so that we can join and support a concerted effort to lobby all legislators at every level to oppose guns, especially assault rifles. Nobody needs an AR15, or a bump stock. They should be outlawed and confiscated from all current owners and then destroyed.\n\nTo those who argue the same old \"guns don't kill, people do\", please read Nicholas Kristoff's excellent analysis, with verifiable statistics and graphics, that prove the exact opposite. The US has the most guns and the most gun deaths. It has to stop, and making comments to the NYT won't help. We need concerted action through a national organization to counteract the evil that the NRA has inflicted on this country. The cowboy mentality must end., 3 Mass shootings have become so common that there is nothing left to say about them that hasn't been said a thousand times before.\n\nBut nothing will change as long as the gun lobbyists own congress and Republicans could care less about the welfare of their own people., 3 I\u2019m sorry to burst everyone\u2019s bubble but guns didn\u2019t cause this carnage. An evil human being is responsible.\nIf you want to truly stop it you need to give law enforcement the tools and public support to stop it.\nThis is a serious issue and blaming inanimate objects is not going to result in positive change. , 3 Are there accessible statistics tracking the amount of money generated by the monthly/yearly purchases of AR-15 rifles state by state? Must be millions. Such greed over human lives., 3 For at least the fifth time in my life, the lines over weapon control are being drawn, again, for the same reasons, because of the same type of situation. I have heard, and said, and pondered, and debated, all this before, sadly.  So let me simply say this instead: \n\nRegardless of the trials of the day, always put aside the weight of the world and hug the ones you love goodnight.  While you will never know when that hug will be the last, they will know your love is forever.\n\nRest in peace, dear children.  We march forward yet again to this seemingly endless debate, always with your memory at the forefront, bolstered by the knowledge that you were hugged and loved in this life., 3 Is it a specific gender that would cause this?\n\nIt has not been identified & could yield clues as to why he, she, it did it., 3 It says something about what we are as a nation when we refuse to address the main cause of such violent deaths which is the abundant supply and availability of guns, after every gun massacre. It just shows that we value guns more than people, even our young ones. The root cause for all these incidents is guns and the ease of procuring those types which can inflict mass casualty. The second amendment dates from an era when we were a poor country without a standing army worried about foreign intervention, citizen militias made sense. That is not the case now when we are the most powerful country on earth with the capability to destroy the planet several times over. The second amendment has become a foil for the arms and munitions industry and the gun lobby (NRA) to maximize their profits at the expense of citizen safety. No place whether it be schools, movie theaters etc are safe anymore because of guns and it is ironic that the gun lobby will use this sense of hopelessness to encourage people to buy more guns, of course after sending all their \"thoughts and prayers\" to the victims and their families of gun violence! , 3 If we as a Nation wish to solve this continuing carnage across our nation our\nPoliticians need to address honestly the root cause of this critical problem.\n\nTrump, Rubio, Ryan, Grassley immediately identified the root cause of the problem as mental health. They turn their back on the fact every industrialized nation has people with mental health issues . Yet they do not have the gun carnage we have.\nWhy because guns particularly semi automaticsare are available to all in the USA but not in other countries I  cannot get my head around that a nineteen old American cannot touch alcohol but can get a murderous weapon\nTrump wants to make us great again but much of our nation lives in a state of fear on a perpetual basis, the fear of getting sick, getting shot in schools, church at concerts, the fear of hunger , the fear of being deported to a country unknown. Yet Trump only sees our borders as reason for insecurity\nAn article in today's NYT identified that children born in the USA have the highest risks factors compared to all other civilized countries.\nLet's make America honest again, 3 How many more children have to die needlessly before we can have a sensible gun control? My daughter is a freshman in a high school in California, today I sent an email to the principal asking if the school is safe and what they plan to do to prevent this from happening in our school. She replied: \"...we will be conducting an active shooter drill on our campus in conjunction with [the local police]...\" When I was in high school, the worst thing that could happen to us was a surprised chemistry test. I never imagine in my life time that we actually have to do an \"active shooter drill\" in our school, high school! For those politicians and others who insist on the right to bear arms as an excuse not to put a stringent gun control, I hope this is a wake up call; this can happen to your love ones too., 3 A daughter texted her mother from a storage room, amidst rounds and rounds of rapid fire.  She said:  \n\n'If I don't make it. I love you and appreciate everything you did for me.'\n\nIn the wake of another mass shooting, do we believe, in our collective hearts, that victims, family members and survivors will be able to say -- of their country: \n\n'I appreciate everything you did for me.', 3 I think people should be allowed to buy AR-15s and the like.  As a condition of that purchase, they must live in the District of Columbia and may not leave with their weapons.  Who says we don't need a border wall?, 3 Campaign finance reform would fix the problem of the gun lobby.\nJust look to the way Europe and Canada do their political campaigns. Much better than the US, and we could adopt their method if the people absolutely insisted on this to their Congressmen. It would take unity and perseverance, but it is within our grasp. Maybe if your kid was one of those killed, you would care., 3 So unfortunately it's time to re-read last fall's article citing Adam Lankford a professor in Alabama. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-inte...\nThe conclusion reached in that article hasn't changed.\n\"The Difference Is Culture...\nAfter Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.\n\nThat choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart...\n\", 3 OK, NYT.  Lie number one, that I know of.\n\"Asked whether he understood the circumstances in which he found himself, Mr. Cruz whispered two words: \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d \"\n\nI saw the video of his court appearance.  He didn't whisper.  He spoke in a clear voice., 3 Why cut off the cash cow, aka NRA and their massive contributions to GOP congress members and Donald John Trump? Gun control, bah! until we get rid of these parasites who people our government., 3 There is no legitimate reason for a civilian to own an AR15. Next time your neighbor brags about his Bushmaster call him out for his complicity in the murder of school children., 3 It\u2019s irrelevant to which hate group this person held allegiance. If it wasn\u2019t white supremacists it would have been another group who advocates hate. People like the shooter seek that dynamic out like starving people seek food, and they always will. I don\u2019t see that as the problem. The problem is the ease with which the shooter was able to legally own an assault rifle that soldiers use in battle. Such a weapon is not necessary on the streets of America and in the hands of potential homicidal lunatics.  I used to think that if somebody shot up  Congress and made them bleed for once instead of our school children, things would change, but, sadly, when it did happen, absolutely nothing changed. So, we\u2019ll weep for the dead, call for the execution of the shooter, blame his mother, the police, the water he drank everyday, rage for or against gun control at the top of our lungs and then forget about it in a couple of weeks. , 3 Don't drink while you're pregnant, ladies.  Also, let's not let troubled depressed teenagers have assault rifles.  \n\nIf nothing's going to be done about gun laws, we need to start shunning and shaming people who own assault rifles, unfriending people who post pictures of guns, and making it public knowledge who in our neighborhoods keep guns in their homes., 3 well now ,someone has identified the shooter in Florida as one of Trumps \u201cvery nice people\u201d,one who killed a woman in Charlottesville and this one who has\nKilled 17 young people in their school,yesterday\nThe right,ALT right,the people better known as fascists of my generation.Trump\nEmploys at least Two,they fly around on airforce one,the one you and I pay for.\nThe reason ?so gun makers can sell weapons.\nMoney in the pockets of gun manufacturers,sellers,money money money\nMoney money and money in the pockets of mostly old white men in congress\nNow your kids and my grandkids are at risk everyday because Trump and every\nHouse member,and Senator take money ,Millions,and millions,and millions ,\nAnd millions ,and millions of American money that goes to make the guns to kill our kids we don\u2019t even have the right to say they can\u2019t sell guns to mentally ill\nPeople.Do they care about the mentally ill .......No .They can\u2019t get care unless they have the money to pay for it!!Are the mentally ill also part of our government????, 3 Mental illness takes many forms and is a source of social stigma.  Not every person with mental illness is a killer. Lumping them together is unfair to say the least. Moreover, almost no one wants to admit to suffering from \"it\".  For quite a while, it was represented as the Shhhh disease...don't talk about it out loud, in much the same way that Cancer was regarded as the big C. With respect to the surge in school shootings, most  school personnel are not qualified to diagnose and refer, let alone mandate or provide treatment.  Anyone can say no. Philosophical and political views are not mental health issues. They are cultural variations in a society that has come to a level where my rights are more important and more valid than your rights, and so,  regrettably, this is  not just about disaffected youth.  This is about people with \"issues\" who cannot be corralled or kept locked up against their will.....until they purchase and use an automatic weapon that has no mandate for qualification of ownership, and kill.  Only then might they be sent away, or given the permanent state of punishment that they deserve.  I wish the second amendment protected these victims the way the founders intended it to do, but it didn't. Damn shame., 3 The conservatives are blaming mental illness, but what is that?  In cases like this it looks to me like a mind poisoned with far-right bigotry, hatred and glorification of violence against anyone perceived as one of \"them\"., 3 There will always be people with various forms of mental illness, dangerous or not, diagnosed or not. There doesn't have to be easy access to guns. Civilized societies have figured that out.  , 3 I just heard Paul Ryan say that we have protections in place so that mentally unstable people couldn't get guns.Our idiotic president took away those protections purely because they had Obama's name on them.No one in their right mind would say that mentally ill people should have guns..our president clearly has proven that he is insane and the entire GOP is in the pocket of the NRA.This is not your grandfather's GOP and anyone who blindly pulls the lever for republicans hasn't done their homework or is corrupt or stupid or all three.Paul Ryan just told a huge whopper on nat'l TV.and should be forced out ASAP., 3 When a person with mental health problems can buy this kind of weaponry legally, what does anyone expect?  As a society, we put very little priority on mental health care.  Insurers regard mental healthcare as a big, sticky, expensive ball of wax, with no end in sight, unless the law forces them to cover treatment, and funding is provided as needed.  Many people with mental health problems are not able to pay for the care they need, because of their illness, after all.  Those of us who have family members with mental health issues know firsthand that the police are a virtual brick wall.  The law doesn\u2019t let them do much before a crime is committed.  Florida has pretty lax gun laws too, from what I understand.  It was a perfect storm, in this case.  But the bottom line is, you can\u2019t shoot people if you don\u2019t have a gun, much less a collection of them.  I think the onus should be on the legislators in Florida who passed the laws that made this possible.  The governor of Florida called this act \u201cpure evil,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t accomplish much, does it?  The Governors and legislators, and the NRA should be part of the solution.  They must be made to come forward with workable solutions, but that will never happen without single-minded, implacable determination, large financial contributions, and lots of activism., 3 The solution to this shameful problem that has led to the murder of many people in our country is to finally accept the fact that we as individuals should not have the right to own these weapons of mass destruction, for that is the level of gun ownership in our country. The 2nd Amendment is completely taken out of context and used and abused by those who want to in essence profit from the death of innocent people. \n\nPeople around the world look at us in disgust and I agree with them. Speak out, speak up, fellow Americans, to demand lawmakers make it illegal for all of us to own guns as we have no right to have the power of death in our households and hands., 3 NYT is a great paper and leaves no stones unturned. With each new mass shooting, we get fancy graphics, unearthed smartphone videos, detailed descriptions of the anguish of families who lost their loved ones for no reason and thousands and thousands of comments. Just like the politicians and law enforcement leadership who appear on TV for a couple of days after each incident with long faces and obvious impotency in dealing with this, this great paper is also looking robotic.\n\nQuestion is how much focus this shooting would get from NYT a week from today when our great president pops a newsworthy balloon of some kind or his counterpart in NK does something smart? Will NYT carry the torch on this issue then? And, if not, then we all will, just like this time, again come together virtually for the next episode, and then the next one after that and so on. , 3 There will be no action whatsoever until most of the current Members of Congress are voted out.  Plain and simple.  We are spinning around and around with the same old garbage rhetoric from the NRA, the same old excuses about why Americans are not entitled to health care, that options like Medicaid for example, should be cut.  So how are mentally ill people supposed to receive treatment?  They need health insurance with real treatment options, but no one wants to pay for it.   Congress can't have it both ways.  Either get all of the guns off the streets so the mentally ill can go untreated, or treat all of the mentally ill so they don't have access to the guns.  (Or my pick... treat the mentally ill and get some real gun reform too.)  But no--- we keep hearing about how either situation just can't be helped, but instead we are all supposed to \"pray about it because now is not the right time to make changes.\"\n\nBy the way,  you can see if your Members of Congress accept \"donations\" from the NRA.  You can check at the Center for Responsive Politics which does comprehensive research into which companies, groups, organizations, etc. fund the campaigns of the people elected to represent US.  You might be surprised by what you find.  \n\nhttps://www.opensecrets.org/, 3 Our President couldn't even say the word \"gun\" in addressing our nation about this tragedy.  He babbles on about a wall making Americans safer, but refuses to say that better gun control laws would.  He is the terrorist we should be worried about the most.  Regardless, any elected official who has received \"blood\" money from the NRA should keep their mouths shut about this tragedy, and better yet, voted out of office the next time they are up for re-election., 3 This kid lost his adoptive mom, had to adjust to a new set of caregivers, and exhibited problems in school that led to expulsion. That sort of response to loss of a parent is not atypical. He was known among his peers as owning a gun or guns and as a ticking time bomb, and his social media accounts showed disturbing posts, which is atypical. I am strongly in favor of radical gun control, but why did this kid not receive sustained supportive help? \n\nWhen you push an obviously serious problem onto others to deal with, and in this case there appeared to be few others who could help, then you increase the odds that a kid will fail badly in some way. Our schools should be places that are best able to help troubled kids by engaging them and treating or facilitating treatment of their problems while keeping them close so they don't feel alienated. Troubled kids get more support that way and can be engaged in different ways by many people on staff, in class, in clubs and groups, and in sports. \n\nThe trend over the last several decades is to put cops in the buildings and escalate many infraction and behavioral responses that used to be dealt with in more normal adult-to-kid supportive ways. You don't solve problems by pushing them away. This kid obviously felt pushed out by the adults who were in the best position to help him and felt as if he had no one., 3 \"...Trump Focuses on Mental Health Over Guns\"...This headline is Onion material...gold Jerry gold...How can anyone place the name Trump and the words \"mental health\" in the same sentence without convulsing with repressed laughter.\n\nNote photo which accompanies this article --- Are these two girls checking the \"reality\" on an iPhone?  I'm sorry...I'm over seventy years old and I just don't get it., 3 How long will we allow the Russians to keep funding the NRA on a massive scale so the NRA can buy politicians wholesale at state and federal levels? Forget election tampering - Putin owns our politicians through his NRA proxy and is underwriting the funding of mass murder and social chaos in America. , 3 Nutcase with no prior history walked into a store and bought a military weapon with ease, JUST like our founding fathers intended!   Until we vote out the politicians owned by the NRA, nothing will change.   We, as a country, have decided that gun industry profits trump our own safety and security., 3 I do not want to hear the words \"mental illness\" or \"prayers\" or \"bullying\" or any other useless anodyne until the assault weapons ban is back in place.  Who were these friends who allowed this child to bring an assault weapon into their house?  How is it his mother allowed this troubled boy to have an arsenal of guns?  What is wrong with people???  Just because our craven Congress is in thrall to the gun lobby, just because Florida has totally irresponsible gun laws, how is it that individuals responsible for children appear to have no idea whatsoever that guns are deadly and that automatic rifles are super deadly?  I am beyond disgusted and not only with Congress., 3 17 counts of premeditated murder, not TERRORISM?! This was a clear act of terrorism influenced by a white supremacist group (read: terrorist organization) in Tallahassee, the Republic of Florida group. It's time to treat these mass shootings as exactly what they are: terrorism. And it's time to rout out the white supremacist terrorist groups in the United States. America First, right, Mr. Trump?, 3 I'm certain it is worth the perks of office to wrap oneself in the Second Amendment, kowtow to the NRA while it stuffs your pockets, and beg it not support your opponent. Sleep well, Congress. , 3 All that money for the military, all that money for a wall... sure, we need protection from outside forces. But considering our toxic politics and mass shootings, we need protection from ourselves even more., 3 Our national flag should depict a mass shooting with an AR15.  It obviously reflects the principles of this country.  We vilify those with best intentions who struggle for work but applaud the industry of firearm manufacturers like Colt and Smith & Wesson., 3 As I've before so many times, these guys are stand-up NRA \"law abiding citizens\" that the NRA and its followers say should be armed to the teeth. Until they pull the trigger and kill people. Then they are disavowed as having mental health problems. But remember even when Trump is bleating on about mental health he signed a bill into law a year ago removing regulations that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase a gun., 3 Lincoln talked about the shame of men who were \"wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces.\" How to understand, then, our tolerance of the gun lobbyists and weapons manufacturers (not to mention the politicians they purchase) who profit off of the blood of children.  These people literally make their take-home money off of the murder of innocents. Gun sales always go up after the fear mongering that attends shootings, giving money to manufacturers.  Gun control efforts also increase, which are countered by increased expenditure upon gun lobbyists. Pusillanimous politicians fund raise their bribe money based off the 'threat to guns and the [second clause] of the second amendment.'  How many murders make up each one of these peoples' mortgages?  their car payments?\n\nPerhaps it would be useful to have a NYT series that features  photos of the gun lobbyists and NRA types, as well as their 'thinking and praying' and profiting politicians, side-by-side next to photos of gun victims.  These parasites are likely immune to shame, but public acknowledgment of the source of their money would be of use to our bleeding society. , 3 Of course he joined a white anger group.  He is bombarded with people telling him he is the worst kind of human trash because he is a straight white male who wants sex and success.  \n\nOn guns, nobody under 21 years old should be able to buy or own any gun.  Under 21 use with direct supervision only.  For semiauto rifles and handguns, a mandatory 6 month wait and reasonable purchase limits.  And then the most important part,... 10 year federal time for any crime of violence with a gun.  No exceptions.  No leftie judges slapping the wrists of the gun criminals., 3 The foreign media provide more details on the shooter\u2019s association with a white supremacist group and on the fact that among his victims are several Jews. He may be a real ideologically-motivated terrorist, after all. This matters. What it amounts to is the fact that NRA provides means of committing political violence to terrorists, whether of Islamist or neo-Nazi variety., 3 I would like one solid, reasonable, fact-based argument as to why a person needs to own an assault rifle other than sadistic, violent, unbridled aggression.\n\nI'm waiting. , 3 This morning I dropped my kids off at the school bus stop, and for the first time, had a momentary panic attack as the thought crossed my mind that it is not entirely unreasonable they might not come back alive. I have spent some time today researching which group I can join that would most effective at reducing such incidents.  And yes, that includes groups advocating for gun control.\n\nI live in the West.  Hunting and shooting are a part of the culture here.  Guns are worn openly in public.  But I am done.  I am no longer willing to support unlimited rights to own such destructive weapons.\n\nYes, part of this tragedy is a mental health issue.  Certainly that is one variable.  However, until there is an astronomical improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of individuals who would carry out such an attack, I see no reason to allow unfettered access to machines, the only purpose for which is the rapid killing of human beings. \n\nYou want to hunt; target shoot for sport; keep a gun for protection? Fine, I really don't care.  But even my hunting friends agree, if you cannot hit your target with a few bullets, you have no business owning a gun.  It is time to address some issues., 3 Until the voting population of this nation votes out of office any politician that refuses to look at meaningful gun control - particularly regulating who can obtain military grade weapons-this will continue to happen.  You can focus all you want on mental health, but the reality if this nation is awash in guns.  We have a violet culture and we relish violence in movies, gaming and other \"mainstream\" cultural media.  We have only ourselves to blame.  No where is safe - churches, schools, movie theaters, shopping malls, concert venues, night clubs -and you can't have a metal detector and armed guards every where.   Due to the large numbers in the nation, one thing we should consider is requiring insurance for ownership.  We should tax weapons and ammunition.  We need to elevate the cost of gun ownership significantly.  Yes, legal owners will howl that this doesn't keep criminals from getting guns.  However, I don't recall \"criminals\" being responsible for any of the recent mass shootings.   We have a domestic terrorism problem, and the root is the use of military grade weapons that are used to terrorize the citizens of this nation.  , 3 So this guy trained with a white supremacist militia?  Why have the other members of this terrorist organization not had their door broken down and been dragged off at gunpoint?  , 3 sub literate, white, right wingers are the greatest threat to our country. not middle eastern terrorists., 3 Someone has to explain that to me like to a five year old.\nThe kid couldn't have gotten a light beer and pack of cigarettes, but can just walk into a shop and buy an assault rifle.\nThe kid would have been arrested with a few grams of weed in his pocket, but running around with an assault rifle is ok.\nAmerica, you sure have your priorities straight ..., 3 So Mr. Cruz belonged to a hate group with mentally health issues. But our president deflects the hate issue by only calling the gunman mentally disturbed. Of course the only solution is to \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health\u201d and just accept the horror of American terrorists; members of hate groups.  Our president has emboldened them when stating their members are very nice people.\n\n\u201cWe are here for you\u201d, says the man bought and paid for by the NRA. There has to be a sensible process and solution to protect the rights of all gun owners and to keep guns away from very dangerous individuals. The existing laws have failed America yet once again., 3 Traitor Trump, white supremacists, and the NRA. The pieces all fit., 3 why don't the hollywood hypocrites stop putting out ultra-violent films that poison our youth, desensitzing them to violence. guns are not the only issue here.   , 3 Madness is doing the same stupid thing over and over and expecting a different outcome. \n\nWelcome to Trump/NRA World. , 3 Here is one more report, among thousands and thousands [nonstop], of a mass killer having purchased his weapon of mass destruction \"legally\". The gross irony, given the mass killers' use of their weapons \"illegally\", is staggering.\n\nOnce again, mentally challenged Trump zeroes in on curbing mental illness -- rather than enacting tougher, indeed uncompromising, new gun-purchase laws -- as our society's principle call in reducing gun violence. And once again, with this cockeyed thinking Trump falls into the rabbit hole.\n\nSure, mental illness often plays a factor in these mass murders. However, it is a motivation, not the Cause. Mental illness does not kill; guns do.\n\nOf course, sadly, this analysis makes but a tiny drop in \"what to do?\" about America's Gun Problem. The greater problem of our gun culture -- far more demonic than in any other civilized nation -- is the problem with our culture at large: the angry, partisan, have-and-have-not culture that is so dividing us, it is making strangers of ourselves and enemies among us.\n\nSo much is broken and in dire need of fixing in this woeful nation. The demented gun market makes up just a tiny part of our woes., 3 trump rules! guns rule! white guys murdering at will with ar-15s rule! the gop rules! learn it! that's the way it is. nothing will change., 3 For there to be any change, the students, teachers and their families and friends that have endured these horrific shootings must join together and make sure that on Election Day, Americans nationwide vote sensibly. How much longer can we allow this to be ignored? How many more victims will we bury? \n\nShame on those in Washington who think it's OK that Trump signed a law revoking Obama's regulatory initiative that made it more difficult for mentally disturbed to purchase guns. This was on February 28, 2017. Supporting this bill was/is/remains a sign of mental illness.\n\nHaven't we had enough?, 3 I am going to address the comment made by Paul Ryan, then shut up.\n \u201c.... shouldn\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data.\u201d\n\nSince Sandy Hook, Congress has been locked in a knee-jerk reaction of doing nothing.    Try something else.   , 3 Gov. Scott is lame and the entire state of FL is complicit with the murder of 17 children and adults! They have no regulated gun laws at all., 3 Hey Trump, stop binging Fox News, Tweeting, and playing with your hair, and read something for once:\n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-i...\n\nToo many words / facts ?  Let me quote it for you:\n\n\"If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. But the mental health care spending rate in the United States... and the rate of severe mental disorders are all in line with those of other wealthy countries.\"\n\n\"In 2013, American gun-related deaths included 21,175 suicides, 11,208 homicides and 505 deaths caused by an accidental discharge. That same year in Japan, a country with one-third America\u2019s population, guns were involved in only 13 deaths. This means an American is about 300 times more likely to die by gun homicide or accident than a Japanese person. America\u2019s gun ownership rate is 150 times as high as Japan\u2019s.\"\n\nCould it be the GUNS? \n\nAnd no, we don't have more crime than other western countries...\n\n\"...the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries... American crime is simply more lethal. A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner... but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.\"\n\n* Now please pass this around to the adults in the room. *\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9217163/america-guns-europe, 3 \"A white nationalist group claims the suspected gunman as a member.\" Does this mean Nikolas Cruz was one of those 'Fine People\" that Trump spoke about ?, 3 Just what is it going to take to finally have the sit-down and really change meeting on Gun Control. The wonderful USA is the only country in the entire world with regular mass shootings of its citizens by other citizens with semi-automatic and other weaponry bought in a store. Doesnt anybody get it yet? ..and a mental health discussion is NOT it. , 3 VOTE all Republicans out of office. They are only beholden to the NRA and its war chest of money - not to the safety of our citizens and our children. \n\nAny law-abiding citizen can follow the process of background checks and if it takes longer so that a person like Cruz who faced disciplinary action in school or maybe should have undergone a psych eval before he LEGALLY purchased is stopped from getting a gun, then that will make our country safer. Yes, crime will still happen but GUNS make crime more LETHAL. Cruz would not have killed 17 people with a knife or a baseball bat or a chainsaw or any other type of weapon., 3 Trump tweets: \u201cSo many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\u201d\n\nAnd what are the authorities supposed to do with this information? , 3 Paul Ryan lives in Lala land, and part time in Ayn Rand land. He is not a competent adult when it comes to these sorts of issues. How much data do we need? How many shootings do we need to decide that enough is enough. I will bet some of the parents and friends of those killed in all of the school shootings think we have enough data and that there have been enough killings to quit flapping their collective jaws about guns and do something. OH wait, Ryan needs the NRA, silly me. The NRA makes the GOP's world turn. What was I thinking? We need to paint the NRA and it's supporters, including the pols who take money from the NRA, with the brush they deserve, the brush and paint that say \"Sponsors of Killings\". Yes it's \"this killing is sponsored by the NRA, Paul Ryan, Donald tRump, and all those that take NRA money\". Call it like it is., 3 No need for gun controls here we've only had 18 of these incidents so far this year. What's the big deal! Can't let something like this interfere with the commercial side here, the money is far more important, now isn't it!!!!!, 3 \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon\" - Just like the GOP likes it. The right to commit mass murder is the most treasured right the GOP worships, and those soulless politicians will never budge no matter how many need to die as a result of their misplaced beliefs., 3 First step: All candidates and elected officials, state and federal, stop taking campaign donations from the NRA and gun manufacturers. Listen to individuals and families affected by gun violence instead. Listen to police who face guns every day; Listen to school authorities. Listen to the families of mentally ill individuals with violent tendencies. Listen to gun safety experts. Listen to constitutional law experts to find ways to reduce gun violence without trampling the rights of responsible gun owners. Where there's a will, there's a way. , 3 We must always report such bad and threatening behavior? OK! Hey, a bunch of white guys got together in Charlottesville a while back and marched with tiki torches chanting \"Blood and Soil!\" and \"Jews will not replace us!\", 3 In an article from another publication, it was reported that Cruz had participated in paramilitary drills with Jereb's group in Talahassee, FL. Even though Jereb claims his group \"tries not to participate in the modern world,\" wanna bet the drills included assault rifles?, 3 Carnage in the streets Trump mentioned at his \"inauguration.\"  Well, he owns it.\n\nTrump?  Mental health?  Guess he'd know, the darned ol' stable genius., 3 Ask yourself, do you feel safe knowing that almost any \"citizen\" can hold distant power over your life? I ask my friends that question. No one trusts an armed population.\nPerfectly sane people can descend into madness at some point in a long life. Quite a number do.\n\nSo I suggest:  The only people who can own any firearm will belong to a hunting club or association of several members. Each member of the club will be responsible for the mental health of every member. Each club will be carry a bond against harm by any member sufficient to cover any damage done by any member, say $10 million.\n\nAll firearms will be kept in a locked safe within the club location. No single member can access the firearms. Regular activities can be scheduled around those sports involving firearms, including contests of skill and hunting expeditions.\n\nExceptions to the group control of firearms can be made for licensed and bonded individuals who derive their livelihood or sustenance from hunting in rural areas only.\n\nPeriodic review of the mental and emotional state of those licensed individuals should be mandatory.\n\nThe fearful thoughts of those who feel the need for protection should be made more aware of the danger of home ownership of firearms, including the deaths of loved-ones through suicide or by children playing with an unsecured weapon. No greater tragedy exists.\n\nBy such actions a safer world can be had., 3 I guess Donald was acknowledging his own mental illness when he publicly suggested that perhaps the \"second amendment people\" could \"do something\" about Hillary. , 3 Per NYTimes reporting in October 2017, the following representatives received the following funding from the NRA during their careers, 1989-time of report.\n\nYour prayers are hypocritical and lack of real action cruel, Congress. Were these amounts of money worth it? I would be the victims of every mass shooting would say no.\n\nJohn McCain\t$7,740,521\nRichard Burr\t$6,986,620\nRoy Blunt\t         $4,551,146\nThom Tillis\t$4,418,012\nCory Gardner\t$3,879,064\nMarco Rubio\t$3,303,355\nJoni Ernst\t        $3,124,273\nRob Portman\t$3,061,941\nTodd Young\t$2,896,732\nBill Cassidy\t$2,861,047\nFrench Hill\t$1,089,477\nKen Buck       \t$800,544\nDavid Young\t$707,662\nMike Simpson\t$385,731\nGreg Gianforte\t$344,630\nDon Young\t$245,720\nLloyd Smucker\t$221,736\nBruce Poliquin\t$201,398\nPete Sessions\t$158,111\nBarbara Comstock\t$137,232 , 3 The worst president in American history CANNOT even mention the word \u201cgun\u201d after the latest massacre of children in this troubled nation by an automatic weapon!  He instead focused on mental health as if a troubled youngster who slaughters 17 people is mentally ill.  I believe we can all figure that one out!  , 3 NRA MONEY IS BLOOD MONEY. It is time to hold the NRA and politicians accountable for their complicity in enabling these mass shootings., 3 Why does the NYT continue to report on mass shootings like this? It is clear that nobody cares enough to do anything, my guess is that if a gun control measure was put to vote in Fla. it would lose, we can continue to be cannon fodder for the gun inustry. The NYT can put up the mass shooting dashboard just so we can keep track:\n   Days since the last mass shooting\n   Number killed in the last mass shooting\n   Number of mass shooting this year\n   Total killed in mass shootings this year\n   Gun industry profits in the past year\n   Gun industry/NRA campaign contributions in the past year , 3 blood on the hands and souls of the NRA and their GOP supporters , 3 A depressed loner and crazy about guns,what better country than the US to be born in., 3 Paul Ryan is saying today that mental illness is the real problem that explains these massacres. This is false.\n\nThe incidence of the most common types of mental illness are relatively constant across populations. Yet the US is the only country (at peace) that has this level of mass murder. Clearly the difference is that the US allows widespread and easy access to weapons that can cause mass casualties.\n\nSecondly, barely one month in office Trump revoked an Obama era regulation that prevented sale of firearms to those with mental illness. So Trump's only action on gun control was to make a bad situation worse. His actions make Americans less safe.\n\n99% of the rhetoric from this man is empty and false., 3 When Donald Trump talks about the killings in Chicago it's guns, but when we have these regular Mass Killings in our schools it mental illness..........if it were just mental illness, you could grab the guy when he was trying to use his fist beating people.\n\nIt is time to Ban All Assault Military Style semi automatic weapons being sold to the public and force a nation wide mandatory background checks.\n\nNo one should be able to buy and own weapons that are as potent as the ones Police, Law Enforcement or the Military use, this is not a second amendment issue, no one is talking about not owning rifles or shot guns for sport and hunting., 3 Well, thank god he didn't have to break any laws to obtain that assault rifle., 3 Paul Ryan and all you other law makers who take money from the NRA, all of you with blood on your hands, save your pathetic prayers and sympathies and finally tell the NRA It's over.  Start doing your jobs...working for the American people......and start passing gun control laws.  Stop the sale of guns at shows and online, ban assault weapons, ban bump stops.  What will it take to open your eyes.  Do your children have to be murdered in schools or movie theaters before you begin acting as responsible law-makers/parents.  SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!, 3 If the shooter had said \"I want to join ISIS\" it would have been a significant statement the authorities and press would get excited about.  After all, ISIS are killers and they kill, for the numbers of it.\nBut he said he wanted to join the military, the American military.  He even played Army with a pretend para-military group.  How many of our mass shooters served in the military, in any capacity?  At least a third of them.  Even one of the \"original\" school shooters, Columbine, the dominant of the murderous pair, had a parent who was in the military.\nMost Americans are unaware, and the press certainly will not repeat, that there is a wide swath of evil, a lack of respect for human life, that exists in our military establishment.  The people in the military will say it's a necessary evil, to protect the 'homeland', but it has gotten out.  I know about this.  I was employed by the DoD for 17 years in Washington DC.\n America has no respect for human life.  It's fashionable to kill.  People don't respect the elderly.  They are dumped in nursing facilities to die.  Most of the people who die in disasters like hurricanes or wildfires in California are the elderly, abandoned.\nMedical error is the third leading cause of death in the USA, the most powerful country in the world.  You would think doctors could do better.\nThat kid wasn't mentally ill.  He is at war.  For every person who cries about the evil he committed there are others who quietly cheer him on., 3 Q:  \"What's the difference between fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and ignoring White Supremacists here at home?\"\nA:    Not much.  We're fourteen years into losing at the former and have allowed the latter to survive since 1776. , 3 The public defender refers to him as a \"child\" -- but he is 19, so he is an Adult by most definitions - who is accountable to corral the behavior of someone 19 years old with red flag indicators? We really do not have social systems in place to accomplish that and with future budget interventions, we will have even less capacity. , 3 Perhaps teachers and their students in Florida should protest gun laws in Florida by refusing to attend school until the law is changed. Or perhaps we need a constitutional amendment to allow the states to regulate guns however they see fit within their boundaries.  If the people of Florida continue to elect state officials who have surrendered their judgment to the NRA about the right to buy automatic weapons, then the consequences only need be theirs. , 3 The mental health argument is an insult. This is all on the NRA., 3 We just had a kid step in front of a train last Sunday.  One of our students.   There are a lot of troubled kids out there today.  So sad and tragic., 3 Why not just save these comments and paste them on the comment section of the story of the next mass shooting? There is a sequence of reactions that follow one of these shootings as day follows night: shock; outrage; fervid calls for gun legislation; flowers left at the site, candlelight marches, and forgetfulness. Look at the list of school shootings and see how many you remember besides Va Tech, Columbine, and Sandy Hook. And if the latter, in which 20 babies were murdered, did not move the needle on gun control, nothing will, From 2009 t0 2011, we had a Democratic President and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. How many gun control laws were enacted? You got it: none. It's hopeless., 3 Prior to the 2008 Roberts Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, the Supreme Court limited the right to bear arms to the federal government [United States v. Cruikshank (1876)] and the type of weapons to a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation of efficiency of a well regulated militia\" [United States v. Miller (1939)]. \n\nNow the stats:\n\n- Between 1982 - 2008, before the Roberts Court 2008 affirmation of the individual's right to bear arms, there were 47 mass shootings with 735 casualties. That equals 15.3 casualties per event and 28.3 casualties per year over 26 years. \n\n- In the 10 years since the Roberts Court affirmed the individual's right to bear arms, there have been 50 mass shootings with 1,342 casualties; a rate of 26.8 casualties per event and 134.2 casualties per year.\n\nAnd you ask, who is to blame for this madness?  My answer: Any Politician, Party, Judge, Lobbyist, or Person, including and especially, the President of the United States, who does not act to eliminate weapons of mass casualty from civilian society.  , 3 Governor Scott says this is not the time to discuss gun control. And Trump thinks gun control is for losers. The NRA-controlled Congress sends condolences but refuses to act. People in this country are routinely murdered because politicians refuse to follow the wishes of 80% of the American public who want some control over weapons of mass annihilation on our streets and in our schools. If citizens refuse to elect politicians unless they support gun control we might achieve some sanity in our country. The NRA won't be happy until every kindergartner is packing heat. STOP THE MADNESS!!!!, 3 Paul Ryan says we shouldn't knee jerk react without all the data.  \n\nWe have  all the data.\n\nGun manufacturers lean on lawmakers to withhold legislation, because it will adversely affect their profit margin.  Lawmakers withhold legislation, and our children die because of it.  \n\nThis is American genocide, not against ethnic or religious minorities, but against ALL Americans, for the sake of the profit of a few.  , 3 Another NYT article shows that the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle used was easier to obtain than a hand-gun.  Common-sense gun control has worked for every other country in the world.  Stop the NRA's stranglehold on our legislative process.  #stopthekilling, 3 What would the commentary be if the shooter had dark skin and was a Muslim? Would Trump chalk it up to mental illness then? What does it say that the Uzbek man who mowed down the West Side Highway, San Bernardino culprits, etc. are branded \"terrorists\", yet the Las Vegas shooter is a \"sick individual\"?, 3 Wow.  Can't buy beer, but sure can buy a super semi -automatic killing maching.   Way to go NRA., 3 \"Bangbang prayers bangbang prayers bangbang prayers\".\nThe soundtrack of Republican-ruled America. And if prayer was so efficacious, we wouldn't need all these prayers. Or guns., 3 Chris Rock proposed to tax bullets at $1,000 apiece. Amen. , 3 Pretty sure he doesn't care. It will be nearly 10 or 15 years before he ever get executed., 3 The shooter had the shooter had a YouTube account until 2/13 and the FBI couldn\u2019t find him.  Another FBI failure along with ignored warnings to the FBI about Arab flight students before911, the Boston Bombers, the San Bernardino killers, the Orlando killers and the Chelsea bombers.  lynch  publically admitted to not being able to find Salman Mateen after the Orlando killings.  Thank God that under Trump she is in prison., 3 A Republican senator couldn't have stated it more plainly or more truthfully. When Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) was asked to comment about what should be done to end the unconscionable gun violence in the United States, this is what he said: \n\n\"I don't think we need more gun control. I think we need more idiot control.\"\n\nSpoken like a true idiot. \n\nWake up, America. Vote the idiots out of office. All of our lives depend on it., 3 I watched Hannity rant last night about our failure to secure schools, suggesting we use retired military and police to guard them.\n\nGreat idea! Let's not forget churches. And movie theaters. Outdoor music concerts. And nightclubs. Let's station well-armed retirees everywhere! That'll do it. , 3 Ours is a perversely violent nation.  Our idols are guns, cowboys, cage fighting and the NFL.  We are uniquely able to rationalize and even enjoy the public spectacle of an unarmed black American shot in the back by a cop on an Oklahoma highway.  Wild west.  We don't really believe in each others' family or community - because that would mean accepting that we are a multiracial and interfaith society.    So, all the rampant violence and rage and ignorance creates homicidal maniacs at a rate that surpass any nation.   These American terrorists are monstrous creations of ourselves, and our president., 3 Imagine what Trump would be saying had the mass murder been committed by a Muslim, immigrant or refugee.  Assuredly, Trump would not cite mental illness or blandly state that no one should have to feel afraid.\nIn fact, you need not wonder.  Trump used the occasion of the Pulse nightclub shootings to ask for a shutdown of Muslims entering the country, and asking President Obama to resign from office for not using the term 'Islamic terrorism.'\nTrump cares about those killings he finds politically expedient, the rest are just collateral damage from the NRA's stranglehold on our nation., 3 \"The president has blamed mental illness for previous mass shootings, even as one of his first acts as president was to repeal an Obama-era regulation that would add the names of mentally ill Americans registered with the Social Security Administration to the database used for gun purchase background checks.\"\n\nTrump is a liar and a hypocrite. He also deeply in debt to the NRA and his Russian comrades, who are happy to see us destroy ourselves with gun violence:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/02/02/us/politics/ap-us-trump-russ..., 3 This isn't about white supremacists. This is about mental illness and gun control. While supremacists are vile, they're not responsible for these mass shootings (2% of all gun deaths in the U.S.) or the tens of thousands of other deaths (two-thirds of which are suicide by gun). \n\nWe need some commonsense legislation. In virtually every, single shooting there were huge red flags. \n\nViolent temper\nHad brought a weapon to school\nSerious disciplinary problems\nFringe of his peer group\nBullies peers or is an abusive partner\nPreoccupied with weapons\nHas been expelled from school\nCruelty to animals\nLack of family supervision\nPrefers violent themes in media\nDepressed or suicidal\n\nAny one of those or even several doesn't necessarily mean someone is about to execute a mass shooting, but taken together with other warning signs, it should be pretty easy to spot and intervene. It's time for our politicians to act to stem this tide. , 3 Maybe someone needs to inform Donald Trump that just because someone \u201csays\u201d or \u201cthinks\u201d someone has mental health instability or issues, that is not proof enough to prevent someone from purchasing a gun based on \u201cmental health\u201d as he would like to predict. \n\nAgain.  This president does not have a clue.  \n\nDonald - read the lips of the 2,900+ students who ran out of the Parkland School yesterday, terrified, and today grieving - many of them are calling on their governor, authorities, legislators, parents, and yes, even the president to stop the sale of automatic guns! \n\nHow many needless funerals does this country need to face?\n\nAnd for what?  To satisfy and reap more legislative donations from the NRA? , 3 \u201cNeighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\u201d\nIs it just me, or does it sound like Trump is blaming community members for this tragedy?  Perpetually passing the buck., 3 How can anyone take anything this phony blowhard says seriously?  He does not care about anyone or anything other than himself.  See if he proposes any legislation or measures that would restrict access to firearms by anyone.  Don't hold your breath., 3 We are a crazy country.  What kind of a joke democracy do we have when Wayne LaPierre of the the NRA, Grover Norquist, and the Koch brothers had more influence over Congress than the vast majority f combined American citizens.  The 2nd Amendmentmade some sense 200 years ago when we didn\u2019t want and could not afford a standing army and we were a rural nation.  The amendment is nonsense today.  In my younger days, I enjoyed hunting quail and pheasants but I had attended formal courses on firearm safety.  Also served as an Air Force Officer for 22 years.  No civilian needs an assault rifle  with an untrained yahoo and few need a handgun .   No firearm sportsman wants to be i the field with an untrained yahoo who thinks he is Wyatt Earp, 3 This isn't so much about guns as it is about alienation. , 3 \"We're here for you?\" \"Whatever you need.\" \"Whatever we can do for you?\" I'll tell you what they need and what you can do, Mr. President,  do something about gun control. But you won't. Because you have the NRA breathing down your throats, you and Congress.  I often wonder what would happen if just once Congress did something about gun control, like making assault weapons illegal, and they lost the support of the NRA.  Would the members of Congress be struck by lightning? Would they fall down a well? Is the money from them that important to you that you allow all these children to be killed time and time again without blinking?  Is your heart made of stone? You know what's coming in November and you deserve it, each and every one of you.\n\nWe don't need assault weapons  - we don't have big game in this country and we aren't at war in this country. There is no need for these war weapons., 3 #guncontrolnow, 3 Clinton's fault. She diverted FBI resources away from crime prevention to the fake Russia election collusion charge., 3 Its not hard to buy a semi-automatic AR 15 in Florida.  Why, because Florida Republicans love guns, love the NRA and don't care about dead children shot to death in their school or dead adults shot to death out on the town (they did nothing after the Pulse shooting in Orlando, also an AR 15).  \n\nIn fact, the Florida legislature is due to vote today on a bill that would further weaken the minimal background checks required for concealed weapon permit.  They don't even care on the optics of weakening gun laws the d ay after this mass shooting.  , 3 Right now--dreaming of taking their country back--a million armed, aggrieved, working-class white fellows are listening to talk radio or watching Fox, seething at Libs, minorities, and others. Some are relatives, some friends of friends, and most of them seem to be unhappy with tedious democratic processes. It's as if they want a civil war but are unsure why or how to start or where to shoot. Most of them need counseling to sort out their violent urges., 3 That while supremacy group is doing us all a favor by showing us the extremist approaches of its members.  They cannot disavow the actions, sorry.  You supported this perpetrator.  You gave him a place, and comfort for his views.\n\nThink about if it were one of your children who dies, or your child's teacher?, 3 Marco Rubio stands there with his pockets stuffed with money from the NRA and Gun Lobbyist and says it's not the time to talk about gun control and banning these Assault Military style weapons. \n\nHollow and meaningless words by Trump today as he parrots the approved talking points of Wayne LaPierre and the NRA, he's talks about mental illness, but refuses to talk about the one common denominator and elephant in the room, Military Assault Style Weapons, as he stands there in a pool of blood of the victims., 3 After every incident of school shootings there are the usual and often repeated questions about gun control, mental health care and on and on. There is really only one question which should be asked: Why is America the only developed country on the planet where these school shootings and other shootings continue to happen?, 3 Last year in February, Trump repealed an Obama administration regulation to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. Just remember that. , 3  A few months ago the New York Times put together a list of the senators and congressmen and women who receive the most financial funding from the NRA. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the list with each Republican:\n\nSen. John McCain (R-AR) $7,740,521\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-NC) $6,986,620  \n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) $4,551,146\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) $4,418,012\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) $3,879,064\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FLA) $3,303,355\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) $3,124,273\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-OH) $3,061,941\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-IN) $2,896,732\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) $2,861,047\n\nRep. French Hill (R-AR) $1,089,477\n\nRep. Ken Buck (R-CO) $800,544\n\nRep. David Young (R-IA) $707,662\n\nRep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) $385,731\n\nRep. Greg Gianforte (R-MT) $344,630\n\nRep. Don Young (R-AK) $245,720\n\nRep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA) $221,736\n\nRep. Bruce Poliquin (R-ME) $201,398\n\nRep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) $158,111\n\nRep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA) $137,232, 3 Rubio be gone ASAP--you are a disgrace to your state and a disgrace to this nation.  And all of your NRA-supporting party members., 3 I'm so glad that this American could purchase this gun legally.\nNRA members and employees should be proud of their work. \n\nSomewhere in my memories from high school, I remember that the freedom to bare arms had something to do with militias. , 3 Students should go on national strike and refuse to return to class until politicians act.  They will continue to be failed by Republicans and the NRA, and die, until they take matters into their own hands., 3 We all know our elected officials will do nothing meaningful to address the situation (other than utter vapid \"thoughts and prayers\"). Short of removing your children from school, here's my suggestion for one thing we parents can do:\n\nEnsure your children have on their cellphones a pre-loaded a text message saying something along the lines of the following:\n\n\"Mom, Dad, we have been told there is an active shooter at our school right now. I am trying to stay safe. I wanted to tell you thank you for being my parents and that I love you in case I don't make it home.\"\n\nNot all children will have time to compose and type such a note themselves when their school experiences a mass slaughter. It's not much, but it's better for their parents to receive such a text rather than nothing before finding out their child is dead., 3 I love the GOP Senators and Congressman who are offering prayers to the first responders and victims, who are bathed in the blood of the victims, because they are enablers of these mass shootings by accepting the Blood Money from the NRA, and Gun Lobbyists to keep these Assault Weapons and killing machines legal to the general public.\n\nIt really is time the majority of the country stop supporting these politicians that are bought and paid for by the NRA, and bathed in the blood of our murdered children., 3 And Trump thinks the problem is on the other side of his imaginary wall., 3 I give up. I agree with Trump and Rick Scott. This is a mental health problem - the mental health of GOP Congress members. \n\nWhat does the DSM have to say about individuals who put their own reelection above the lives of the people who voted for them and their innocent children? And what does it say about someone who reads \"A well regulated militia...\" and think it means one guy with as many guns as he desires? , 3 So the latest mass shooting has reopened the debate about what can be done to prevent these tragedies. Let's look at this situation realistically.  There are over 300 milliion guns in the US and law-abiding citizens are unwilling to give them up.  Congress is unwilling to take on the NRA and adopt even limited gun control measures.  Civil libertarians are unwilling to allow law enforcement to detain someone or take his/her gun based on social media rantings or other behavioral markers that fall short of constituting an actual crime. \n\nThere is a solution.  It already is in place at airports and should be expanded.  Police or other armed security personnel who are trained to spot potential killers (and maybe metal detectors) should be posted at every entrance to every school, mall, stadium or any other place where the public gathers.\n\nNow obviously this solution would be incredibly expensive and inconvenient.  But we can't have our cake and eat it too. If the public is unwilling to incur the expense and annoyance of such a system it means that we have collectively decided that the risk of us or our loved ones becoming the victim of a random shooter, and the anxiety associated with that risk, is not great enough to justify the cost and inconvenience of added security.  Fine.  But the next time a mass shooting happens remember it ultimately is us who have made the choice to live (and die) with these tragedies.                       , 3 What a disaster. Cruz could have been stopped if medical and psychological therapy had been employed.  There must be a rethinking of how we apply therapy and medicine to segments of our population that are likely to harm themselves and others. \n\nThe FBI was warned, students knew Cruz was likely to do something like this, the school board knew he was dangerous because they expelled him yet Cruz was able to gain access to the school.  WHY?  Everything was put in place except mental health professionals who should have kept tabs on him., 3 What Republicans say after every mass shooting: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims.\"\n\nTranslation: \"Until you pay us more than the NRA is currently loading into our campaign funds, get lost: we couldn't care less.\"\n\nRemember, guns don't kill people - Republican inaction does. , 3 Who in the world cares about what Donald Trump says about events like this?  It doesn't matter what he says...he is incapable of providing any meaningful leadership and merely clogs the airwaves.  Frankly, the same can be said about Paul Ryan.\nThe real story here is the bottling up of constructive legislative proposals by the GOP.  The words don't matter...actions directed to change do.\nSo start covering the real story, NYT., 3 A legally purchased weapon, military drills to kill the darkies when they need to with other bigots - and the governor pretends this is about mental illness. \n\nYeah. If people allow this to slide by, it'd be a shame - if it weren't so dulled by repetition as over and over the same thing happens. , 3 I think there also needs to be a cop at every entrance of every school in my opinion from now on. If that goes through no one will be able to get through unless you show that you are student of that particular school and show your lanyard of that particular school with your picture id that is what needs to happen now., 3 Our militia certainly isn't well regulated if this is the type of person who can legally purchase a semi-automatic rifle and do this much damage. Just saying ..., 3 \"...the family had seen signs of depression in Mr. Cruz, but nothing indicated that he was capable of this kind of violence. The family had allowed Mr. Cruz to bring his gun with him to their house, insisting that he keep it in a lockbox.\"\n\nHere's a rule of thumb that any rational person should follow: If your child or other family member is depressed, they do not need access to guns. You should take those guns away and monitor the individual more closely than you normally do while they are undergoing treatment for depression.\n\nSince our morally bankrupt Republican-led government won't change the laws regarding mental illness and guns, we should have some expected rules of conduct when it comes to mentally ill people and guns, don't you think?\n\nI know that this family was trying to do the right thing by caring for him after his mother passed, but come on. This is going to keep happening again and again. , 3 Trump tweets \"No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school\". The opposite in fact is true, how could any child ever feel safe in an American school?, 3 Every teacher, professor, parent and student should go on strike until these assault weapons are banned. Gun owners should be forced to purchase liability insurance for each and every gun they own...just like cars. It will be on the insurance companies who would have to pay for these tragedies to decide who should be allowed to own a gun. #GunReformNown, 3 Enough with the prayers!  They solve nothing.  Enough with the focus on the mentally ill!  Too nebulous and won't stop psychopaths.  The only solution is to ban the purchase of live ammunition!  Unless you are in the military of the police force (and I would argue the police don't need live ammunition either), make it illegal.  But the US won't so nothing will change.  Until the next one or the next chapter in Trump saga.  Which will come first?  Bets?, 3 Can I say it? One of Trump's base. , 3 From an email from the Brady Campaign (named after Ronald Reagan's press secretary who was badly wounded in the assassination attempt)\n\"Early reports indicate that the shooter exhibited increasingly violent behavior, and that his mother had even resorted to contacting law enforcement in the past to control him. This behavior led to his expulsion from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year. In cases like this, a law known as an \u201cExtreme Risk Protection Order\u201d can empower those who are close to an individual in crisis to ask a judge to temporarily take away the person\u2019s guns. But Florida doesn\u2019t have such a law. If Florida had such a law, his family would have had the ability to prevent this shooting before it began. Four states (CA, CT, OR, and WA) currently have such laws, and it is being considered in statehouses across the nation. Contact your state legislator to ask them to support ERPO legislation in your area by texting PARKLAND to 877-877.\"\nFact sheet re Extreme Risk Protection Orders:\nhttp://www.bradycampaign.org/sites/default/files/ERPO-Fact-Sheet_08-2017..., 3 The question isn't whether or not he bought the assault rifle legally, but rather why can anyone buy an assault rifle legally. The assault rifle in civilian hands has only two purposes; to be used to kill a lot of people quickly, or to be played with as a thrill toy. Neither of these purposes is justifiable, but the Republican Congress refuses to act. The assault rifle with an extended magazine has been used many times in the past to slaughter members of the public. We know that it will be used to slaughter members of the public in the future. Congressional Republicans have blood on their hands. They are responsible for the deaths of the students at Parkland. They need to be held to account. , 3 Maybe when Donald Trump brings up the question of mental health he has first hand knowledge., 3 House Speaker Paul Ryan says public policymakers \u201cshouldn\u2019t just knee-jerk before we even have all the facts and the data,\" adding \"We need to think less about taking sides and fighting each other politically, and just pulling together.\u201d  What craven mealy-mouth heartless pabulum. When George Orwell wrote that \u201cPolitical language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidarity to pure wind,\" he had in mind moral vacuums like Ryan.  Here's some data (from Politico): From the NRA during the 2016 election cycle, $171,977 to Ryan, $5,900,000 to GOP candidates, versus $106,000 to a half-dozen NRA-friendly Democrats.  Blood money., 4 It's incumbent upon all of us to hold our representatives and our society as a whole responsible. Especially in an election year, neither we the public nor those in the media can allow ourselves to let this go over the course of the next month. This kind of tragedy is supposed to be unacceptable, but it is our collective acceptance that permits these horrors to become routine., 4 This is your second amendment in action. With a few state-mandated exceptions all of you have a constitutionally enshrined right to own assault rifles. Want fewer of them around? Try only voting for politicians who will actively support a constitutional amendment to change that fact. All the rest is hand-wringing, national-day-of-mourning, flags-at-half-staff, meaningless nonsense. Don\u2019t want all the bullets flying around your country? Bite the bullet and amend your constitution., 4 The chief hombre says it\u2019s too early to be thinking of gun control? Has he forgotten about Las Vegas and the many other shootings? What a cop out. , 4 It\u2019s a good thing all of these guns are protecting everyone from any tyranny, right?    , 4 The bulletridden cloak of thoughts and prayers hasn't even saved one life, ever. \n\nPast time to get our government representatives off their knees and out of church. Their continual use of religion as cover for stupidity and/or cupidity is why it has no place in governance and why it, like those who mouth the platitudes, belongs in the political boneyard., 4 You get the government you deserve and everything else along with it, 4 I wonder if one of the GOP had a child in one of these horrific incidents if they'd still be satisfied with only \"thoughts and prayers\" to console them. , 4 Okay world the USA is #! !!! We are the greatest! No, no! in health care or education, or infant survival rates, etc. We are #! in the number of lives taken by gun violence in any given amount of time. We are proud to protect those 2cd amendment rights. We are America, we have the right to bear arms...this is what makes us great. Really? We are one SAD country indeed. , 4 Where is the #again and again and again...I don't have twitter, but soon every american family will be able to say me too! about a relative killed in a school shooting, 4 \u201cWe\u2019re children. You guys are the adults.\u201d, 4 You're not allowed to drink beer under 21 but you can legally purchase an assault weapon. GOP is a total disgrace. , 4 I just don\u2019t get it! Ever since Weinstein got caught there is not a single day w/o media coverage of abuse/rape/assault.... But, as many others already said, a month after Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Pulse, etc, etc, etc, etc.... there is nothing but silence about people being killed in mass shootings...... You media please stop talking Trump and Weinstein every single day the way you do, pages over pages and better start talking NRA, guns, mass shooting, people killed every single day for the next 365 days! Of course only if you agree that so many lost lifes and so many people left behind is worth writing about! Thank you NYT!, 4 I here so many arguments against it, but the we are going to need metal detectors and security personnel at schools.  This has already been done in some New York schools.  It is the only effective counter-measure to stop these horrible murders of our school children., 4 Who will be the first brave politician to say publicly that they will no longer offer there platitudes to the victims and their families but rather say they will do something more meaningful.  That while perhaps they may not yet know all the answers but that they will commit to work to finding solutions that will reduce gun violence and mass shootings in America with whatever action it takes.   Weather it is more mental health care, more effective regulations related to weapons and ammunition, more effective security, more studies into the cause of gun violence or any other ideas.  That they will work with anyone including the NRA, Democrats, Republicans, and anybody as long as effective real progress is made. That this is what is owed to the families of the victims.  And that they will not stop until progress is made.    It's time to reject the idea that platitudes are all we can do.  The time to start fixing this problem is now.  , 4 If legislators again don't take action, aren't they in effect saying that these shootings are acceptable?, 4 All the counter-arguments fall flat:\n\n1) They'll get them anyway.\nTrue. Some will. But for some it will make it harder. Save lives.\n\n2) It's against the American tradition of liberty.\nTraditions are not more important than the lives of our citizens.\n\n3) The ones who are most determined are least likely to be stopped.\nTrue. But some are just doing it because it's easy. Let's stop those.\n\n4) There are benefits for law abiding citizens.\nTrue. We can create a more secure legal path for those people and make it harder for others.\n\n5) It's an inevitable problem. It's part of life.\nNot on this scale. We can lessen the problem.\n\nWho in their right mind can argue these points?\n\nBut here's the thing.\n\nI'm not talking about guns. I'm talking about a much more severe problem. drugs.\n\nGuns killed 13,000 in 2016\nDrug overdose killed 52,000\n\nThe drugs come (mostly) from Mexico. Why aren't Democrats up in arms about massively upping border security? All the arguments they make: they'll get through anyway, it's against our immigration tradition, there are economic benefits, it's part of life are the EXACT SAME as the Republican arguments against gun control.\n\nThe answer:\n\nBecause border control will lessen future Democrat voters. That comes before 52,000 lives. Same way Republicans won't do gun control cause it will lessen NRA donations and voters.\n\nPolitics and money first. Don't kid yourself. You're all the same., 4 It's interesting that the confessed killer in Florida this week isn't yet old enough to buy a drink but is old enough to buy an assault rifle.   Makes perfect sense to me.     (Just like the amnesia about the \"well-regulated militia\" language in the Second Amendment.    Not often seen on bumper-stickers.), 4 It's very moving to see teenagers express their opinions about this tragedy. They are resilient and will get through this. \n\nBut I am thinking of the first graders in Newton (Sandy Hook) who watched their little friends die. One little girl survived the slaughter and was quoted as saying \"they are all dead\" when she was taken from the classroom.\nThat breaks my heart., 4 School shootings, nightclub shootings, church shootings, concert shootings, workplace shootings, mall shootings, road rage shootings, domestic violence shootings, and on and on and on.  Let's face it America, we obviously don't care.  If we did we would demand some action from our elected representatives, something other than\"prayers and thoughts\", but we don't., 4  There is a  culture of  violence  that has developed  in which  the  assault rifle is a significant symbol.\n  One thing that would seem helpful  would be to  recognize  that  any private individual or business that  buys, sells, or  is seen with  an assault type  rifle  for  whatever reason should  be  shunned. Businesses  should  be picketed and boycotted  and individuals  should  be isolated.\n No law is necessary for  that. If you know  someone  who has  a  high-powered semi-automatic  rifle shun them  and  tell  them why. Ownership of  stock in  such   companies  should also  be  anathema. The point is to create a responsible  national culture  and personal and financial  accountability that has  greater impact  than  waiting for  the NRA or Congress to  come  around. We have the power to make  this happen., 4 These events are horrible, but more gun control is not really the way to go. Mexico and Brazil have very requirements in order to buy legal weapons, but they have a very high rate of homicides by fire weapons. We must find out why these people carry out these acts, act on any leads that can prevent these incidents., 4 At a garage on the east coast, my service manager and two of my  fellow mechanics carried handguns and collected assault rifles.  At a social service agency in the Midwest, my boss kept an assault rifle in the trunk of his car and carried a Glock. In my next job, working for a state agency for persons with disabilities, another supervisor carried a Glock and a coworker brought his new assault rifle to the office to show it off. At yet another government agency, my closest coworker's idea of a fun weekend was to spend it with his sons, shooting their assault rifles.  I have highly educated, well-to-do  relatives  whose hobby it is to build custom AR-15s.  I don't believe my experience is an anomaly; after all, I only moved to this country when I was 18. I grew up as an ex-pat in Pakistan, where the only citizens I ever saw with guns lived in villages near the Afghani border.   This is not an NRA problem, or a gun-nut problem or a GOP problem.  This is an endemic and deeply systemic disease., 4 Sad but not unexpected. I remember the outrage after Sandy Hook and still nothing much was done.  At that point when America decided that murdering young children with a firearm was an acceptable price for \"freedom\", the gun control debate was over. I have always joked with my children, who are all in their 20s, that my number 1 job as a parent was to make sure that they made it to adulthood happy and healthy.  America's adults have failed their children., 4 After all these many horrors do NRA officials slap each other on the back and say \"Well, that was a good day's work?\" Do the members of congress who have betrayed the trust of their country and its citizens for the blood-soaked money if the NRA congratulate each other for helping massacre innocent children? Do voters who keep these monsters in office understand their complicity in this American tragedy?, 4 The time for \"reasonable\" gun control laws has passed  Anti-gun advocates must reach for the stars.   We need UNREASONABLE gun controls starting with repeal of the Second Amendment.  In addition everyone who owns a gun should have a valid license to have a gun, must complete a course, must BE  required to have liability insurance, must renew their gun license every 3 years, and will be fined if the gun is used in a criminal offense.  Beyond that guns must be heavily taxed just the way we tax cigarettes and alcohol.  No civilian should be able to purchase an automatic weapon or semi-automatic weapon. \n\nSorry gun worshipers - your right to own a gun does not \"trump\" my right to LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  , 4 Publish the names and call out everyone who is on the board of the NRA. We're looking at you fake minister Grover Norquist.  , 4 Voters need to make NRA political contributions the kiss of death for your local politician\u2019s career., 4 Strong-willed American women recently started a \"Reckoning\" that is putting an end to work place sexual harassment and an end to the scourge of powerful men abusing their positions.  No one could have foreseen the incredible sea change this Reckoning has brought about.\n\nWell its time for a second Reckoning.  If strong-willed American women can bring down abusive corporate executives, what's stopping a strong-willed American populace from putting an end to the NRA's stranglehold on the politicians that refuse to change America's gun laws?  The American people need to make it socially unacceptable for ANY politician to bow to and take money from the gun lobby.  Make taking their money so socially toxic that no politician will be able to refuse gun reform.  Do it now, before the next (inevitable) school shooting.   , 4 gop WILL NOT do anything. It does not matter how many children are killed... Trump, NRA, gun lobbyists, Foxnews WILL keep offering excuses and alternative reasons. American citizens can keep getting killed at a crazy rate - it does not really matter to them as greed completely trumps any concern for America.\n\nIt is up to us. If big tobacco was eventually beaten, the big gun lobby can be too. What can WE do? Do not say \"vote\". Voting is imperative - but not enough.\nWhat can we do for this specific menace? Fire up a consistent media storm? Put up a clock in Times square up-to-date with gun death scorecard in US? Take out full page ads conservative leaning (but not propaganda)  publications? , 4 I am proud of the America I know that has had enviable history of being an inspiration to many countries around the world who have looked to up to us in terms of how we operate and conduct ourselves as a society. Unfortunately, we are now \"America the Sad\" in terms of showing the worst about our society to the global community at large as they watch in sheer awe. Why is it that we do not read about horrific school and mass shootings in other highly respected countries like Canada, UK, Australia, etc.? Why, why? Are we actually more stupid? Are we really less educated? Do we honestly care less about one and another vs. say the Canadians, British, Aussies, Swedish, etc.? I work for a global company and I am ashamed of continually trying to explain to my peers around the world why we as Americans - the leaders that we think we are - how can we NOT doing anything to help protect our children. We are indeed a laughing stock to the world (ie. my peers are stunned at how we let the NRA govern and push us around; they were at least smart enough to never let the NRA exist in their respective countries)! We, as adults, have done nothing to force our government to emulate how other advanced democratic countries both love and actually protect their children...it is a very SAD statement about who we are as Americans right now!, 4 Dan Barry mischaracterizes our politicians like Trump, Ryan , Grassley, Rubio. None of them are leaders. They are the modern day version of  Judas Iscariot.  They are indebted to and  enslaved by the NRA, who gives them their 30 pieces of silver. in return, they, like robots, carry out the NRA's mission. A leader thinks for him/herself,they analyze information, they weigh the pros and cons and reach a reasoned ,and, hopefully a principled decision. None of the current Republican politicians have exhibited leadership qualities or behavior on gun control. They have chosen to pledge their allegiance to the gun lobby,not to our most vulnerable and innocent schoolchildren,or to church goers,who are slaughtered by the likes of the Parkland shooter, a teenage mentally ill man who was able to kill them with a semiautomatic military style weapon. They now offer empty thoughts and prayers to the latest group of victims' families., 4 Let\u2019s just try it, for a year say - enact some sane gun control measures, ban assault weapons, close the gun show loopholes, keep weapons out of the hands of those with records of violence/stalking. See what happens. Responsible gun owners keep their guns locked up, crazy/angry/sad people can\u2019t murder 50 people in a minute. DO SOMETHING to change the laws, and just see if it helps. This inability of those somebody (not me) elected to stop putting the NRA and their huge wallet ahead of innocent bystanders is inexcusable, sickening, pathetic, and needs to just end., 4 Assault weapons are big money. The NRA is tool of weapons manufacturers. It is because of the NRA and its extraordinary power to control politicians that the Assault Weapons Ban expired in 2004, and wasn't renewed, reopening the market for the high-capacity magazines favored by mass murderers. It is the NRA that in 2005 secured a law immunizing manufacturers, importers, distributors and dealers from any civil liability. As the head of NRA Wayne LaPierre said, \"History will show that this law helped save the American firearms industry.\" This is not about values; this is not about the Second Amendment; this is about money. And if the Republican party is anything it is the party of big business, big tax breaks, and big profit regardless of whether it kills. \n\nShame on Americans who vote for men and women who support the NRA. Like another commenter said earlier, pulling the lever to vote for a Republican is just like pulling the trigger on kids.\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nra-vs-america-20130131, 4 Why is the second amendment more important than our children?, 4 A thought.\n\nCollect every second of cell phone footage from the massacre. Every second taken by frightened children while it happened. \n\nChildren frantically hiding in closets and stairwells, literally running for their lives.\n\nFrantic faces delivering their last words into their phones, their pleas, their screams, their \u201cI love yous\u201d to hysterical parents.\n\nEvery second of those horribly, horribly tortured moments.\n\nPut them all together and force every congressman and senator to sit and watch it. Together. Let them see each other reacting in horror, crying, praying.\n\nLet them see what a few thousand bucks from the NRA every election cycle bought them.\n\nLet those poor, scared, helpless children deliver the true State of Our Dysfunctional Union message. \n\nWe put dollars and assault weapons above our children and their/our future. Period.\n\nYou want to support right to life. Here it is. Here's your chance. Right here in front of you. Because right to life lasts more than the first nine months., 4 Get America out of every other Nation. \n\nStop selling weapons to terrorists. \n\nThe change can start now, 4 And again and again and again we elect politicians who refuse to do anything about it. We got exactly what we deserve., 4 As an European citizen it is unbelievable how US citizens dont rise up against this situation.\nDo you have the notion that this is not happening in any country in the world like this ?, 4 Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas is where President John F. Kennedy died.\n\nParkland, Florida should become the place that inspires all of us to demand that JFK's call to \"ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,\" finally be honored by a Congress and President who seem to lack the courage and humanity that JFK sought to call forth from all of us., 4 It seems to me that the media is not giving this crime the same cold blooded coverage it gives terrorism- the PR lesson learned during the Vietnam war- don\u2019t show the results of the violence and it will be more tolerated. I had to look hard to find 1 article stating the number of wounded in addition to the dead, often a larger number when assault weapons se re used, the explicit photographs that actualize the degree of violence are also suppressed, no blood, no bodies, no dismemberment is shown unlike when there is Syrian war footage of children in hospitals after a gas attack, or even the shocked dirty boy crying that became an iconic\nImage of the brutality of that civil war, or even the broken foot shown during the Boston marathon attack. I don\u2019t want to see this graphic horros, but this suppression of the violence is enabling the NRA to bank on us forgetting this carnage in a few days and riding back to another election cycle filled with endeared politicians. The left often points out the difference im language and legal process used when a minority commits a crime or even an act of terrorism contrast with a white criminal, this is a case in m point- cover this the way you would cover terrorism and we may see a change, keep pulling punches and watch more school shootings happen and then sell\nmore papers, 4 I wonder if the citizens of Florida will now consider a ban an the sale of assault rifles such as the one used in this tragedy and tighten up their background check system? From what I have read the purchase of such a weapon in Florida is as easy as buying a loaf of bread., 4 We will be remembered by how we respond to this.  This is the defining moment of who we are as a nation.  Are we pawns of the NRA and gun nuts or are we a sane and reasonable people that will make the changes that will address this issue?, 4 In my close circle:\n\n1. My Dad, in the few years before retiring as a teacher, knew the code word at his school for an active shooter lockdown.\n\n2. My sister runs drills with her kindergarten students where they hide under their desks pretending to be \"quiet as a mouse.\"\n\n3. A dear friend with a 4 year old will be home schooling because of school shootings.\n\n4. Another dear friend sits in a line of cars everyday waiting to pick up his son, for an hour, because that is the protocol to ensure complete control of people entering and exiting the school. He's not allowed in the door to pick up his son himself.\n\nThis is not how the rest of the world lives., 4 Require every politician who has refused to consider basic gun safety laws to be locked in a room and look at the photos of the carnage.  No cell phone, no distractions.  Just several hours of photos non stop.\nLet them listen to the stories of the families.\nThen see if they can still say that the money from the weapons industry is still worth more than lives. , 4 I think at this point we can all understand and acknowledge that even with Democrats controlling the House and Senate (unlikely, but let's assume it comes to pass), nothing radical will be done in terms of gun ownership laws. The Amendment apparently cannot be amended.\n\nThere is another solution here, and this one should please Republicans and Democrats simultaneously. It's market-driven (Republicans, rejoice) and it would lead to a much-reduced selection of guns available for purchase (no more assault rifles or sub-machine guns, for example).\n\nThe solution is simple (in theory): according to Forbes in 2017 the 10 richest Americans had a combined fortune of over 450 billion USD. Let's go over this again: almost half a trillion USD.\n\nSmith and Wesson is valued around $400 million USD. Let us be generous and say that overall the US gun manufacturing industry sector is worth 50 billion USD.\n\nThis means that if these wealthy US citizens are genuinely concerned they can use their financial resources to buy out all these companies and stop/restrict gun manufacturing.\n\nSlow down, some will say. Some of the gun manufacturing companies are private; how can you buy them? Well, it's the market - everything has a price. Even if some minor manufacturers refuse to sell out, they would be fairly limited in terms of capacity (and logistically other measures can be introduced to limit their manufacturing ability).\n\nI welcome replies/rebuttals., 4 As much as I despise the NRA and the politicians they have bought off we must admit that with the number of assault weapons on the street we cannot fix this with gun control legislation which, if enacted, will take a generation to have an impact so we must play defense.  Given the power of social media let's create a mechanism to encourage all students to alert teachers and others of friend/associated they are concerned about.  Unfortunatety, the students will have to be our first line of defense/knowledge.  Also, asking retired military or law enforcement, with proper training and clearance,  to join a national taskforce to place more visible security in each school across the nation.  The stakes are too high to  keep kicking this down the street.  DEFENSE is our only chance. , 4 Maybe this time there will be a deviation from this pattern as I am seeing the children who survived demanding change.  Some of them are going to be able to vote in November.  , 4 Nicolas Cruz did not act alone. He was aided and abetted by The President of the United Sates, 52 Senators, and the NRA., 4 These \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d are not being answered., 4 Maybe when we have one a day Congress will develop some backbone.  NRA just go away. , 4 To all of the republican senators who have blood on their hands the families of those murdered in Parkland, those who have been murdered and those who will surely die because of the gun laws that are written by your master wayne lapiere. a hearty thank you. You are beholden to the cowards at the nra and your party will forever be known as the party of hate, and the love of guns. We the voters will make sure you never set foot inside the capitol dome again. Your old ways are not wanted anymore. Time for voters to stand up to cowards like you who will forever have blood on your hands, blood that will never wash off. We are finished with the likes of you., 4 First and foremost, get rid of Citizens United, to remove the money from the politicians,  then and only then will these politicians stop representing these huge corporations and start representing WE THE PEOPLE.   Second, our public schools are run by the state.   If you have a problem with how your State run schools are being managed, try voting in some one who will actually represent you instead of the lobbyists.   Start paying attention to where your local officials are getting their donations from and vote accordingly.   If you want gun control, vote the elected officials that take money from  the NRA out of office.   Republicans are not the only ones taking money from the NRA, they are just getting the most.   , 4 If we want to avoid repeating the cycle of futile responses to the massacres of innocents, maybe we should ask different questions.\n\nThe question \"why\" has not led to any progress -- probably because it is not a scientific question, but a phenomenological one.  That is each dysfunctional shooter is dysfunctional in his own way.  Public policy cannot deal with individual motivations for murderous behavior.\n\nInstead, responsible news reporters and we the people should demand on knowing HOW the massacre was enabled.  Then we can focus policy reforms on disrupting the flow of events that lead to mass killings.  , 4 \"An organization called Gun Owners of America complains that 'another gunman was able to roam freely without any armed teacher or principal opposing him.'\u201d\n\nIs that not like an industrial polluter of water complaining that people are causing themselves to become sick and die because they have not invested in personal water purification systems capable of reversing the harm the industry is doing to a vital public resource? I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something about that argument seems a bit off to me., 4 One thing is clear: we as a country continue to value violence and guns, especially automatic weapons, above safety and security.  It's as simple as that or we would not have these repeated incidents.\n\nAnd, it's a false argument to say that if you keep the guns away from mentally ill people you solve the problem.  For one, good luck trying to identify everybody who is mentally ill.   Can't be done.   And, the consequences of missing even a few real risky persons are catastrophic.   Instead, if you get rid of the automatic weapons you will prevent the vast majority of these cases.   The reason is that these guns enable \"lazy opportunists\" who would be very unlikely to commit the crimes if they had no automatic weapon.   That is, these weapons enable them to kill large numbers of people with little effort; if they needed more effort, they would not  likely commit the crime.   Do you think this kid or the fellow in Las Vegas would have committed their acts if they had only a shotgun, a six-shooter or a sword?   Highly unlikely.   There's no rush to it.  The quickest way to prevent these incidents is to keep automatic weapons out of the hands of civilians.  Even many gun enthusiasts would agree.      , 4 Home schooling could get a boost.  Too bad most parents have to work.  In a first-world country this doesn't happen., 4 It's so unbelievable and difficult to even imagine the magnitude of this very sad and horrific tragedy. A country like USA with all it's resources and great thinkers are unable to solve such a seemingly straight forward problem. Unless, heads at the top start rolling, I don't think anyone will care to solve this at the right earnest. Shedding crocodile tears doesn't help. It has become too frequent and can engulf almost every district. God bless the parents and the little kids. We all hang our heads in shame, anger and sorrow., 4 the majority of these atrocities are performed by mentally ill people or people who have obtained those guns illegally.  more people are killed each year by illegal handguns in our inner cities.  more people die each year from diabetes and obesity.  more people are killed each year in auto accidents.  so logic dictates that we need to take cars away from people, outlaw spoons, take away illegal handguns, restrict automatic weapons from falling into the hands of criminals/terrorists and then, and only then, restrict semi-automatic weapons from sane, legal owners.  Basically, in that order.  but remember, criminal/terrorist types who get their weapons illegally will always be able to get them illegally.  restrictions on ownership to the sane, legal owner does absolutely nothing to prevent these catastrophes.  your anger and venom is mis-directed.  you are going after the wrong fish., 4 Americans want Gun Control\u2014good strong control. We want the NRA dismantled. We want our children to be free of the fear of the crimes the NRA is feeding in the suburbs, the city and the ghettoes.\nENOUGH!!!, 4  I'm not a Constitutional scholar (notice Wikipedia's summary below) on the Second Amendment),  but common sense tells me that profiteers hid behind the Second Amendment not for its orginal intent, but to sell guns to make a buck.    For every responsible gun dealer there are hundreds that use the Second Amendment or lax State laws to justify their lack of oversight to make money.  Do car dealers put a drunk driver behind the wheel and say fine drive off, not my problem, I got a check and you have insurance?   Now is the time for every state to pass laws that penalize the seller of automatic weapons and their manufacture for guns involved in mass killings of our own citizens.   Put these people out of business.    Let them loose everything precious to them.  Don't let them hid behind the Second Amendment.    Slam the door shut on this ridiculous disregard of public safety.     \n\nThe right to keep and bear arms in the United States is a fundamental right[1][2][3] protected by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, part of the Bill of Rights, and by the constitutions of most U.S. states.[4] The Second Amendment declares:\n\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.[5][6], 4 This disgusting environment can be solved so easily.\nAll you have to do is restrict assault weapons.\n\nIn order to buy one you must pass a federal background check. You are also limited to the amount of ammunition you can buy.\n\nThe local law enforcement should be made aware of your gun ownership.\n\nYou want to end the slaughter? Then end it.\n\nLouie, 4 America\u2019s untouchable love affair with guns and violence is a disease that seems morbidly resistant to the antibiotic of reason. It is madness and the tears of the parents will once again run into a vacuum. No number of dead children will ever hold sway with the NRA and their legislative lackeys; how tragically pathetic. , 4 If politicians (I.e. Republicans) don\u2019t want to act without evidence, let them fund NIMH and CDC to study gun violence rather than do so much to restrict such funding that it would be academic suicide for a researcher to build a career in gun safety research.\n\nTechnology is vastly underutilized, both to make guns safer while allowing them to function for self defense, and to improve the accuracy of risk assessment.\n\nIn this setting what does it mean that the Administration\u2019s \u201cAmerican budget\u201d would make massive cuts to Federal support for research?  We should not have to choose between fighting cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and addressing gun-related suicide and homicide.\n\nTo paraphrase the sainted but now-disregarded Ronald Reagan:  \u201cMr. President, tear down this wall!\u201d, 4 It\u2019s time to be proactive. Imagine the power of a march on Washington lead by the survivors of all school shootings and all the people who support gun control laws. Maybe then Congress and Trump would pay attention., 4 So what do you think would happen if each of those children belonged to a Republican Congressional representative?  Would they still pontificate and rail against gun control?  How do you think they would choose between greed and their own flesh and blood. If only they were not so well insulated against the threats that the rest of us Americans are so readily exposed to. , 4 to own a gun like the AR 15 should be a privledge - not a right - training liscensing insurance - fell free to add to the list. You must be liscensed, pass a test and insured to buy a car. any bozo should not be able to gat this WEAPON of DESTRUCTION. , 4 Do you think our politicians would still do nothing and hide behind NRA's skirt if these slaughtered kids were their own kids? \n\nHere's a challenge for our president and congress:\n\nThis is your moment to shine. You've been so extremely motivated to pass the tax law, how about you show the same urgency in fixing the gun problem? Oh, you're too busy lining your pockets with NRA's money... Is it worth it?\n\nFor all gun fans in this country who feel so strongly about the 2nd Amendment: \n\nWhich one would you rather have?\n\n1. your gun\n2. pick up your kid's body from the morgue, 4 The Second Amendment to the Constitution:\n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nI realize this has been argued ad nauseum, but my understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent was that, without a standing army, it was necessary for the states to have militias, consisting of the citizenry, on call to quell insurrection or invasion.  An English professor is welcome to correct me, but it would appear that the second part of the Amendment (\"the right...\") falls within the envelope of the first phrase, \"A well regulated militia...;\" the right does not stand on its own.  This Amendment is therefore not a license to freely hold weapons; such holders are de facto a part of a militia, and should therefore be subject to weapons possession, training, rules and use accordingly only under the auspices of a WELL REGULATED MILITIA.  That said, given we now have a standing army (in direct contradiction to the Founders' intent, I might add), militias, and therefore the Second Amendment, are obsolete. \n\nHow is this not obvious to our legislators, particularly given the number of attorneys who reside in the Capitol, and state houses across the nation., 4 Two big parts of the problem is Citizens United and two year congressional terms. We the people are no longer are represented by our Washington politicians. They represent their big money campaign donors and do their bidding. Nothing is going to change unless it is ordered by their donors. And the two year term limits extremely exacerbates the problem. , 4 I wish some of the brave kids who have survived these traumatic shooting events would ban together and start a movement calling for gun control. I think it could catch fire. #KidsLivesMatter. , 4 Every Senator and every Representative should be locked up 24/7 in the chambers taxpayers provide them until they pull their seemingly useless, cowardly and down right stupid heads out of wherever they've been keeping them [such as in the NRA bank accounts] and pass sensible gun control legislation.  This is not rocket science but it does take folks wanting a change.  And, no bean soup for our so-called Senators.  Otherwise, we need a March On Washington with the city and government shut down until these jerks either do the job for which they are being paid or resign.  And, I mean starting NOW....no holiday for any of them; no weekends off, no being let out of the chamber except to use the chamber on a 5 minute timed break.  Paul Ryan: are you listening?  McConnell:  are  you listening?  Congress: are  you listening?  Lyin' Donald:  are you listening and can you understand?, 4 I am boiling over in anger. Innocent schoolchildren (not to mention teachers and other school staff) continue to get slaughtered because the cowards in Congress don't have the guts to say \"No\" to the NRA. As far as I'm concerned they are as mentally unstable as the perpetrators of these mass shootings., 4 One plus one adds up to two.\nOne: U.S. is the only western country with virtually unrestricted gun ownership; One: U.S. is the only western country where mass slaughters by gun violence occur frequently.\nTwo: Unrestricted gun ownership has created a public safety crisis. , 4 Our politicians are proud to accept \"blood money\" from gun lobbyists. While we watch helplessly as our children, yes children, are murdered. No, no, no, this is completely unacceptable, unconscionable, return the bribes and save our children's lives., 4 Why don't we ban alcoholic beverages? This year many innocent people will be harmed or killed by individuals under the influence of alcohol. Yet we tolerate it year after year.  Sure, there are laws regulating alcohol, but nearly anyone can get it anytime they want. Why do we think it would be different with AR's???\n\n I don't really BTW, support banning alcohol :) \n\nBut the point is, why is everyone so keen to bans AR's when we all know it will work about as well as prohibition did (or the war on drugs, or illegal immigration....). \n\nIdeologues use these mass tragedies as excuses to blame the \"other\" side while we all know full well that nobody has a viable solution. We don't blame Miller Beer every time a drunk commits a crime.....would it be a double standard to hold gun manufacturers responsible for gun crime?\n\nLock down our schools and make them as secure as the hall of the pentagon or congress., 4 The NRA doesn't kill people nor does it support murder.  Don't forget that the NRA isn't some amorphous organization. it's made up of millions of American citizens., 4 Words, this article, mean nothing. I am completely desensitized to these events. The new normal. You readers enable the NRA by not opposing their candidates at the polls. You remain ignorant of their NRA payoffs. Condolences mean nothing to these suffering families some of which likely support the NRA.\nJust saying. ACTION. Decimate the Goliath of the NRA., 4 Come, you masters of war\nYou that build the big guns\nYou that build the death planes\nYou that build all the bombs\nYou that hide behind walls\nYou that hide behind desks\nI just want you to know\nI can see through your masks\n\u2026\nLet me ask you one question\nIs your money that good?\nWill it buy you forgiveness?\nDo you think that it could?\nI think you will find\nWhen your death takes its toll\nAll the money you made\nWill never buy back your soul\n\n - Bob Dylan (and everyone else who\u2019s sick of this), 4 I believe you should have the right to own a hunting rifle or shotgun or a pistol so you can hold an intruder at bay with one hand and dial the police with the other. These concepts are in lasting accord with the bill of rights. The rest of the second amendment has to do with a well regulated militia: a village platoon or company of minutemen selected and led by a trustworthy officer. The rest is madness., 4 We need to vote out any politician that receives money from the NRA because they are never going to vote for any restriction on gun control. They simply don't care how many kids are murdered as long as they receive their NRA pay cheques. Little boy blues Trump and Rubio are poodles of the NRA so they make pathetic speeches and run away to hide. Lets have a national referendum and let the people vote because all the NRA poodles in Washington will continue to sit on their thumbs., 4 The same old stories, again and again. The same old stupid explanations from the politicians and american gun nerds. What is the problem in this country? Too many weapons? Too many mentally ill people? Probably both - like in no other country on the planet! It does not help to pray to the lord every time this is happening. Lord, please let rain brains over this failing state!!!, 4 17 lives were lost because of your stubbornness, USA... \n\nbecause you love your guns more than your families...\n\n...making you the most dangerous country on Earth., 4 Two days before the Parkland slaughter, police in Everett WA (1 of 5 states with red flag laws) prevented an 18 year old student from carrying out an attack.\nFrom his journal: \"My aim has gotten much more accurate. ... I can't wait to walk into that class and blow all those (expletive) away,\" \n\nHe continued: \"I need to make this shooting/bombing ... infamous. I need to get the biggest fatality number I possibly can. I need to make this count. ... I'm learning from past shooters/bombers mistakes, so I don't make the same ones,\" \n\nI doesn't matter if someone \"knows\" an individual is dangerous. Police can do nothing unless there are \"red flag\" type laws, which are as popular among the NRA and their stooges as a gun stock ban. \n\nhttp://komonews.com/news/local/police-everett-teen-arrested-after-plotti..., 4 For Trump and the rest of the GOP to stand there and preach about school shootings being all about mental illness, without the mere mention of gun control, is irresponsible and insulting.  NO average citizen, mentally stable or not, needs the right to bear arms with a military grade assault rifle! \n\nAmericans should be fed up with the NRA putting our lives at risk at soft targets for the sale of these hideous death machines just so they can line their pockets - obviously, at ANY cost.\n\nWe cannot tolerate this anymore.  We cannot allow them to desensitize us and treat this as the \"new normal\".  We cannot allow companies that make and sell these guns to profit off of killing our children.  Let us do more than pray after yet ANOTHER senseless and avoidable tragedy like this one; let's vote the GOP out of existence  - instead of us.  Then we can actually write and pass the right, common sense laws and put check systems in place to stop this from EVER happening again., 4 When are progressive states going to get out from the yoke of the gun happy red states? Can't believe there isn't more of a seperatist movement down there. , 4 From A  on down, easy to identify politicians corrupted by NRA blood money lack the judgement to solve complex problems. Thoughts and prayers are not a strategy, these people need to be removed from\noffice. Call the NRA what it is, a terrorist organization associated with death that holds us hostage., 4 Congress, What's the matter, can't you make it without the NRA? Stop with the \"thought and prayers\" - you're a bunch of spineless cowards., 4 It's like we're a primitive culture living beside an active volcano.  Every once in awhile, it blows and kills a few dozen of us.  Our response?  Prayer.  Maybe this time we should throw a few virgins into the pipe., 4 The Constitution is neither a straight jacket or suicide pact especially when it's misinterpreted as it was in the Heller decision. There is nothing to stop us from banning the ownership or manufacture of weapons that have no other purpose than to kill.  The only thing missing is the political will to act. I'm not optimistic that we as a people have that political will but its up to us and we have been warned., 4 I am not usually an all-or-nothing sort or person, but for me, this all boils down to access to weapons designed for mass killing. I am sure there are a multitude of factors that have led to the escalation of these mass shootings, but without access to weapons made for military personnel, not for civilians, these massacres don't happen. It really is that simple. I have no issue with anyone who wants to own a handgun or a rifle for protection or what have you, but really, does anyone other than a military person facing hordes of the enemy in a life-or-death situation need a weapon designed to quickly mow down as many people as possible? I think not. , 4 Thing 1:  People with a need to lash out.\nThing 2:  People with guns.\n\nAlone, each thing is tolerable.  Together they are trouble.\n\nThe NRA and Trump defend Thing 2 and blame Thing 1.\nMany of the rest of us worry about Thing 1 and blame Thing 2.\n\nBut it is the combination that is deadly.  And since we will neither recall guns and ammo any time soon nor will we devote our resources to making a society that breads less untempered rage, frustration and darkness, there is little doubt that gun-related mass killings will continue.\n\nIf Trump, the NRA or any conservative politician gave a fig for these devastated families, they would join with the liberals to propose comprehensive gun control legislation AND programs for reducing the violence in our society.\n\nBut no.  It is clear that the lives lost are just a blip and the power that comes of courting the NRA and firing up the base far outweighs the price of these lives., 4 One really can\u2019t blame the FBI for not acting in January on the shooter tip, after all with more important things like keeping Trump in their sights, who has time for inconsequential matters like that?, 4 Yes, I am awfully tired of the refrain that \"we offer our thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nThose thoughts and prayers don't help one bit unless you know the victims intimately and can give the friends and family comfort.\n\nYou know what helps? That's right, keeping guns out of the hands of a LOT of people who cannot use them in a responsible manner.\n\nNobody is trying to take your guns away, gun owners. We just do not want you shooting up little kids in school. Trump? Got that?, 4 My letter to the editors of Arizona Republic and Prescott Courier. All I can add here that T. going to comfort families is a sin and and an insult to those who grieve. Maybe they will run him out of town.\n\"After the massacres, I challenge ALL people, regardless of politics, to imagine a child, an adult, we love mowed down in seconds and dying with huge holes in their bodies, and now to go into deep painful mourning, rend our clothes, weep, wail, and ask Why? Imagine the trauma of stepping over dead classmates and friends and family.  ALL of us must go beyond spineless thoughts and prayers. Take your mourning and fuel it into action. We are the adults and are supposed to be protectors, not enablers of a gun industry and a Congress that shrug and dig in their heels and collect money...on the backs of the innocents. Shame on them! What mindless pernicious horror is this? We must take off our blinders as we try to imagine and honor those for whom this is an unbearable real nightmare. Rise up on behalf of the innocents! Do not support or vote for someone who opposes any kind of gun control. This is our duty.\nRev, Marti Garrison\", 4 The rest of the world looks on aghast at America as you let children be murdered.\n\nHow can gun rights override the right not to be killed?\n\nEvery right has a limit. Demand sensible gun laws, America. , 4 Here\u2019s to the heroes: the teachers who shielded their students from harm and died in the process. \n\nFor years, teachers have been denigrated for working too little, having the summers off and going on strike for better wages and working conditions. \n\nFrom Columbine to Newtown to Parkland, teachers have illustrated their first concern is for their students\u2019 safety., 4 I used to think of school shootings as akin to school bus crashes. They're sad, of course, but inevitable.\n\nBut actually, my comparison is missing something. if school bus crashes killing multiple students were this common, there would be regulatory action to make school buses safer. \n\nThe automotive industry would have to set up a powerful lobby group designed to prevent any regulation to improve school bus safety in any way, despite large majorities of school bus drivers (to say nothing of the non-bus-drivers) actually favoring reasonable safety regulation. Any Congresscreature favoring reasonable school bus regulation would then be assailed by the lobby group as favoring the abolition of school buses, in order to get the bus drivers and their supporters to oppose those politicians, even though most of the bus drivers actually favor said regulation.\n\nSo then horrific school bus crashes would become much more routine, thanks to the power of the school bus lobby. Every time, our thoughts and prayers would go to the families of the victims, while we assure them that we will take no useful action whatsoever., 4 If a terrorist had shot 17 Americans in some foreign country, what would the president and congress say and do?  If 17 American athletes were killed by a rogue state, we can be certain that the president would threaten retaliation.  If 17 American soldiers were killed in the line of duty, we would strike back.\n\nIf an American kills 17 innocent people on home soil, the president and congress do nothing., 4 Why don't you nice folk in the elite media cover this issue any time other than in the aftermath of a shooting?\n\nIf you didn't spend so much time trying to bring down President Trump, you might be able to report on things that matter., 4 Reap what you sow. Enough said., 4 The republican party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA. It took less time than the 6 minutes the shooter needed to murder 27 people, for the NRA shills to regurgitate the same old, \"too soon\", \"mental health\" talking points. They gave us bump stocks last time but nothing came of that. What will they offer this time? Trigger guards? Be still my still beating heart!, 4 Sadly it's time for the NYT to republish its mass shooting countdown clock - the one that shows how many days since the last mass shooting, and the one before that, and the one before that... the one that shows how many pointless \"prayer and thoughts\" must have taken place... the one that shows the permanent state of procrastination US legislators are in.... and the one that shows that the US needn't worry about external threats from the likes of North Korea and refugees because it would appear you're very effective at - and seemingly okay with - killing yourselves., 4 if you belong to the NRA you are complicit. Don't hide behind specious propaganda about protecting America on the home front, don't hide behind the joy of hunting and the environment, don't hide behind \"I need a job\", don't hide behind some goofy notion of god given rights. You are complicit. What to do? Quit. Stop the money. And, if you want to protect the homeland, join the military. If you want to hunt, use a bow and arrow for up close hunting experience. If you want to protect the environment don't litter it with ammo slugs and casings. If you want to exercise your rights regarding god, be charitable and donate blood to shooting victims. The rest of us will vote the gun supporters out of politics and enforce laws., 4 Here's a prayer:  \"May God help our elected representatives to come to their senses, stop kissing up to the NRA, and pass the sensible gun control legislation that will get assault weapons out of the hands of all who don't actually need them.\", 4 Major change is possible by striking/ not going to work/making yourself heard till a law is passed... \n\nbut we love our guns more than to do such silly things, don\u2019t we?, 4 Once the Democrats, as they will, attain a super majority in both houses of Congress, the gun issue should be approached based on the concept of what is known as zero-based budgeting.  No piggybacking on last year's budget; you begin from zero.\nFor the gun issue, and as a gun owner, I would begin by banning all automatic and semi-automatic weapons.  Period.  Make possession a felony.  Buy back all the illegal weapons, if necessary, but end ownership.\nNext would come the hunting community.  Identify the most common and most preferred firearms, and calibers, used by hunters and make them legal.  Firearms not on the legal list for hunting would be illegal.\nNext, require special permits for firearms used for target shooting if those firearms range outside the bounds of those legal for hunting.\nNext, register every legal gun; and, require full disclosure of ownership transfers and make such transfers involve a 10-day waiting period.\nLast, attach nationwide civil liability to gun ownership.\nOh, and move the NRA headquarters to Antarctica., 4 As Americans we have all collectively decided this is OK. We allowed the gun lobby and the courts to redefine the meaning of the 2d Amendment from its original intent, we continue to elect people who receive legal bribes from the gun lobby, we ignore the blatantly obvious data that says our level of gun ownership is insane and we quickly move on from these tragedies without any action or followup. We are all complicit. Shame on us all., 4 The dialogue has to change. The NRA and the complicit GOP present sensible gun control as a binary choice, 2nd amendment or no 2nd amendment.: you are either for guns or against guns, eliminating the possibility for conversation and new legislation. They (GOP & NRA) have to be VOTED OUT since they will not listen to the will of the American people. Every legislator on the NRA payroll needs to go. Period. , 4 Enough. Do what other countries have had the guts to do. Effect change via physical presence. \n\nAmericans, at this point, if you aren't marching on Washington en masse to physically throw out the Republicans responsible for this inaction, you are complicit., 4 OK folks, here's how to fix this problem. Sorry to all you out there who think this is an impossible task given the widespread number of firearms in the United States of America.\nSo here's what we do: we don't restrict firearms. Let the guys who want guns have them. What we do do is restrict the sale of ammunition. Yep, ammunition, those little things called \"bullets\" that do the actual harm. Make it so the limit is 5 bullets that a person can legally posses outside of a gun range.\nSo let's say the FBI gets a call that some yo-yo out there is a possible threat to public safety. What do they do? Do they try to check out that person's sanity? What an insane idea. No, they don't. They get a court order and raid his house. If they find more than 5 bullets there, that yo-yo is history.\nSimple. I must be dreaming. Given the complete and total dependency of the US Congress on the NRA, this proposal is laughable.\nNow who are the losers here? The American people. , 4 As long as we continue to allow disturbed people access to guns we have to accept that these events will continue to tear the fabric of our society.  Gun control has to be intelligently implemented.  Shame on us that we can't protect our children or even provide safe places to be educated.  The media trumpets the tragedy.  Violence permeates our society the media and entertainment conglomerates contribute to the problem.  How many movies have to you watched with a gruesome body count.  Video games provide much the same.  If young impressionable minds are constantly bombarded by the idea that violence is an acceptable solution what should we expect when there is easy access to weapons of all kinds.  It's time for the media, our lawmakers and everyone to demand change.   Any legislator who is opposed to gun control must be removed from office.  My confidence in the integrity of our system of government was severely eroded when the Sandy Hook massacre of little children resulted in no change is further eroded by this and every other shooting incident.  Pay attention.  Our inability to address this and many other serious issues are a sign of our countries continuing decline.   , 4 NYT, as the national paper of record, you have the unique ability to materially change the mass school shooting kabuki in the U.S. \n\nEvery time a mass school shooting occurs, publish an online list of every member of Congress (past and present, organized by state) who has received a contribution from any gun rights advocacy group. Don't delete any name based on their stated position or vote. Include the total dollar amount each member received. Keep publishing the list until this reprehensible national paralysis ends. \n\nThough this tactic may appear to be aimed solely at Congress, it's primarily intended to remind all those who vote (or don't vote) of exactly what they're allowing to happen. As we are still a democracy governed by law, the blood of these innocent children is on our hands., 4 Thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers.\n\nCoffee break's over. Time to get back to what's important in my life.\n\n(Lather, rinse, repeat every few weeks.), 4 We have 3 issues here, 2 that are often discussed and a third that I believe needs some study.  Each and every time one of these horrific incidents occur, everyone immediately starts the debate over about gun control and those with mental health issues having access to guns.  At what point do we start to figure out why our society is yeilding these individuals, primarily young men, who seek a cowards way out of the mess their lives have become.  When and why has it become \"the norm\" to murder in cold blood individuals who you are upset with or at odds with?, 4 I guess the prayers aren't working! Please don't tell me to pray harder., 4 Are we fed up yet ?  I think we are.  We can no longer depend on our government to do the right thing for it's citizens. So we must take it into our own hands now. Remember in November. Remove every last one of them., 4 Average US voter turnout in mid-term elections: 40 percent.\n\nAmericans may tell pollsters they want stricter gun laws, but when it comes to doing one simple thing to help make that happen, most cannot be bothered., 4 This article exactly reflects my thoughts. As a foreigner living in the U.S., it is difficult to understand the obsession with guns and the insanity of allowing these shootings to happen. Why are these events not called terrorism? Why should this be any different the from someone mowing down people in a van? How much money went into fighting terrorism (answer: unbelievable amounts) and what gets done to prevent any person, mentally disturbed or not, agenda or not, to buy a gun and randomly kill people? I am sure way more people got killed by this NRA-sponsored, state-tolerated terrorism than religious/fanatic/politically motivated terrorism. And why does the U.S. refuse to learn from other countries?, 4 After tragedies like this, the gun lobby under the guise of respect for the victims, states that now is not the time to discuss gun control.  From now on, when a gun rights advocate wants to engage in a discussion about a private citizen's need for legal access to assault rifles, my ONLY response will be, \"Now is the time\".  Pass it on. #Nowisthetime., 4 I would also recommend the media tone down the coverage. Report the news but don\u2019t glorify it. , 4 Innocent children being senselessly murdered by military grade weapons.\n\nThis is NOT a political issue.\n\nThis crisis has only been confronted by raw ineptitude in the Cogress.\n\nThis is a MEDICAL issue.\n\nThe CDC should not be controlled by politicians, who get lots of money from the NRA.\n\n     ER docs, Trauma surgeons, pediatricians must confront this crisis, because lawyers are not doing a great job.\n\n     If the flow of military grade assault rifles are confiscated, the sale of these weapons outlawed, when the sale of clips and bullets stop, only then will Americans keep our children safe at church or school. Only then will adults keep these weapons out of the hands of mentally ill patients., 4 All this praying and candlelight vigil activity is a waste of time. It is almost an insult to the families who are victims of these shootings. Maybe there would be a different response to all of this if the 17 fatalities were all children of the 17 congressmen that are the staunchest supporters of Second Amendment rights. For good measure towards a different outcome, maybe Wayne LaPierre would also change his tune if one of his children were to have fallen victim to the Wednesday tragedy at Douglas High School., 4 The only government regulation that gun rights advocates seem to respect is the second half of the the 2nd amendment to the Constitution. Even the well regulated militia part of the very same amendment is left off the words above the entrance to the NRA headquarters. The right to bear arms is lifted out of context and above all else, including \u201cthe right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d as asserted in the Declaration of Independence. They would place a tool of death above the sanctity of life., 4 No partisan political leader who prays for the wounded and dead in this school shooting while collecting and counting more donations from the N.R.A. in order to keep getting elected to office without a primary means well regarding gun control., 4 If we and our elected officials can't see this for what it is, i.e., naked greed and intimidation, maybe we deserve to live this way. \n\nHow about this, NYTimes? Publish the NRA voting scores for every senator and congressman. Then launch a national campaign to scare the enablers more than the NRA does, They have the best lobbying apparatus in the country, but they don't have a majority. End this., 4 stop calling it lobbying and start using the right word , corruption, 4 Vote.  Election 2018 is 8 months away.\nVote, contribute. Find candidates and volunteer.\nContribute money to Red State Dems. It negates some of the Koch Bros America for Prosperity money.\n7 years of GOP Congress.  5 years since Sandy Hook.\nGive Dems a chance.  What have you got to lose?, 4 Be like other countries - take away the guns!, 4 Someone please post publicly how much money each Republican politician has received from the NRA. , 4 The vast majority of Americans - including socially conscious gun owners - say this must end.\n\nEVER GUN in OUR United States of America must be REGISTERED on a national database, state LICENSED and fully INSURED for liability.\n\nJust like cars.\n\nAttention gun owners:  WE THE PEOPLE do not want your guns.  WE want your guns to stop killing us and our loved ones.  Don't you?  , 4 The thread of religion and ritual may be more important than we think. Garry Wills suggests that Guns have become our national Religion, or Moloch, to which we perform the human sacrifice of our children:\n\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/daily/2012/12/15/our-moloch/\n\nPerhaps some may change their minds when someone suggests they may be thinking about their Gun more than their God., 4 This is just a rehash of a rehash of a rehash\u2026 It doesn't matter what happens in the US when it comes to guns because of the motivations of our elected officials- i.e. MONEY! The agenda of preventing gun control clearly doesn't take into account our safety- just like an obsession with rolling back regulations in almost all areas of our lives ignores the reasons behind the need for these regulations in the first place. We're wasting time analyzing the profiles of mass shooters because mental illness is a common disease which our society has increasingly chosen to treat as a personality flaw with fewer and fewer resources devoted to dealing with it.  As long as high power weaponry is easily available, this carnage will continue. \n\nFunny how the right likes to limit women's access to birth control, but have no interest in discussing preventing access to weapons that take our children, friends, and loved ones away with senseless acts of mass violence. Nor do they care to offer resources to educate and protect our most vulnerable.\n\nThe narrative that taking away regulations (and not allowing regulations of powerful weaponry) is a boon to our society is deeply flawed.  Industry self-regulation has time and time again proved unsuccessful (Bhopal, Love Canal...).\nAnd, why bother fining VW (clean diesel) for doing what industry does best, maximizing profits! \n\nCan't we examine the motivations of our leaders before we vote them into office in the future?, 4 This answer is straightforward, IFF people really do care to protect our friends and families from slaughter.\n\nIn 1994, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein introduced what was informally called an \"assault weapons ban.\"  The Democratic Congress passed it; the Democratic President (Clinton) signed it.  (The NRA then poured $$$$ into Congressional races to hand the Congress to Newt Gingrich)\n\nThe 1994 ban expired and Bush and the Republicans blocked attempts to reinstate it.  \n\nSince then, a heart-wrenching body count has soared, while Republicans block all attempts to reinstate this ban or to institute other reasonable and sane safety measures.\n\nDiane Feinstein remains in the Senate, and has introduced an Assault Weapons Ban, as described here, along with informative links.\nhttps://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/assault-weapons\n\nWill the NRA shill Republican leader Mitch McConnell even allow a vote on this? Doubtful.  Anyone who votes for a Republican Senator, even a \"good\" one, votes to let McConnell control the agenda in the Senate.\nhttps://thinkprogress.org/mcconnell-no-new-supreme-court-justice-until-t... \n\nAgain, assuming people really do care deeply enough about protecting our friends and families from the ongoing slaughter, get out and vote, and only for Democrats.  The choice to stay home, or of a Republican because X, prioritizes X over the safety and security of our families and children, it is that clear., 4 Comes down to \"Citizens United\". Take that any way you choose. Either the ruling that lets the NRA hold financial sway over who gets elected and push that gun sales agenda, or Citizens stand United in holding elected officials to doing the job they were elected to do - protect and defend citizens. , 4 We feel so sad about the tragic loss of life yet cannot understand why no action is taken. \n\nFor the same reason that it is not a good idea for North Korea to possess nuclear weapons, it is not a good idea to have guns available for general purchase. How many NRA members support giving Kim Jong-Un access to Intercontinental ballistic missiles? \n\nWe are rightly worried about the prospect of an armed Kim Jong Un and are doing all we can to prevent that. Why not do all that we can to prevent the general public possessing lethal weapons? (for they are more likely to kill Americans that Kim Jong Un is), 4 To our leaders (word used loosely) in government who keep offering prayers:\nIf your prayers were worth anything, mass shootings would have ceased by now.  But they haven't, so obviously we need something more effectual, more practical, more results-oriented than your useless prayers.\nWe need you to do your jobs.\nWe need you to turn your backs on donations from your NRA benefactors.\nWe need you to deliver legislative changes -- perhaps even to revisit/rewrite the Second Amendment -- there IS a history in this country of Constitutional Amendments being repealed and/or revised -- to account for contemporary technology and the fact that the U.S. Armed Services constitute our well-regulated militia .\nWe need you to rise, albeit stubbornly and belatedly, to this moment.\nIf not, we need you to relinquish your seats for people who will...\nand come November, we'll make sure you do., 4 There is no civilian in the country who needs an assault weapon.\n\nWant to shoot one?  Have designated ranges where they can be rented for 30 minutes, and shoot at targets all you want.  Turn them back in, they get locked up, end of THAT story.\n\nThis is insane.  , 4 America is owned by greed and corruption.\n\nThe government is controlled by greedy, self serving opportunists.\nWe have totally lost our sense of direction.\nAmericans are competing with each other for survival.\n Ronald Reagan made a great effort to assure us that that as Americans, we are all \u201crugged individuals\u201d and that we need to compete with each other.\nTo me, that was a frightening turning point that explains why we are where we we are. \n\nTo me, the founding fathers had a very different idea, and we should remind ourselves of that often.\n\u201cWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\u201c\n\nE Pluribus Unum\nOut of many, One, 4 \u201cThoughts and prayers\u201d?\n\nAs useless and nonsensical a statement as there could possibly be after yet another mass shooting, uttered by the cowards in elected office who take their large donations of blood money from the NRA.\n\nI remember Paul Ryan talking about how \u201cprayer works\u201d after the mass shooting in the Texas church last year. Seems as though all the prayers after that shooting incident failed to prevent the latest slaughter of innocent children and school personnel in Florida.\n\nRather than thoughts and prayers, Mr. Ryan, how about renouncing the NRA and passing some meaningful gun control legislation?, 4 I am praying. I am praying for those lost in this senseless attack and for those left behind who love them. I'm praying for yet another community that will be permanently damaged by this horror. I'm praying for our political leaders, that they will have a change of heart and pass legislation that will restrict access to weapons meant for a battlefield. I'm praying that our leaders will have the courage to protect this country's people from such carnage. \n\nAt the same time, I will be voting only for candidates who genuinely support sensible gun control. I will be reaching out to legislators urging them to implement laws that protect us all. I am ready to do anything to keep this from happening again., 4 An attorney recently heard on the radio said that laws have been passed to protect gun manufacturers, so that is not even possible to sue them and get anywhere. Most of those suits would be dismissed. We need to rewrite the Second Amendment, but at this point the people riding the new amendment that would need to be approved by, 4 No restrictions to buying guns in Florida but the legislature there would rather restrict and punish Pediatricians just fort asking a parent if they have a gun in their home.  , 4 It is time for all the mother's in America, Democrat, Republican, and independent to stand up for their children when they vote in November. How many deaths are we expected to have to endure when all we get from President Trump and supporters of the NRA are \"thoughts and prayers\"? These are children being killed by weapons of war. What kind of society just accepts this?, 4 To continue my previous thought, the legislators that would rewrite the second amendment that would need to be approved by 3/4 of the states are so beholden at this point to the NRA and gun manufacturers, that the 2nd Amendment would probably be rewritten to demand that every citizen, including kindergartners, be absolutely required to carry a gun. Is this what the founding fathers intended? As a nation we are absolutely demented on the subject of gun ownership., 4 And so in the wake of this latest gun tragedy we hear this from one of our fine public servants in the Congress: \"We don't need more gun control, we need idiot control.\"  So said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. Okay Senator, go ahead and outlaw idiocy. That's not a bad idea if only because you would be one of the first to be arrested for violating it. What a clown., 4 Let's reframe the conversation, I'm not anti-gun, I'm pro life.  For my constitutional freedoms, to attend school and movies and concerts without fear. , 4 When my adult brother died through no one's fault, I watched my parents close his casket for the last time.  At that moment, to them, he was no longer 39 years old.  He was once again their infant son, and they closed the lid on a box that would put his lifeless body into the ground.  As hard as it was for me and my siblings to see, it paled in comparison to what they felt.  More than 17 families in one town will do that this week, all because someone with common human issues and failings could get their hands on war weapons.  \n\nYou want to have a gun and hunt? You want to be able to defend your house?  Fine.  There are firearms that can do those things.  Use them responsibly.  But the notion that anyone can have any firearm they want because of an 18th century fear of tyrannical regent government is not worth making a parent go through that horror.  \n\nCongress:  fix this or we will find people who will.\nMr. President:  please show us you are more than the boorish, bullying, hardhearted satyr the evidence presents - show us that you are a caring, parent, who loves the lives of your children more than anything else, and stop this repeating nightmare.  , 4 The most shallow, hollow words from a politician after such a tragedy.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with you. But is is not the time to talk about controls.\" Go figure!, 4 Why is it that so few people are willing to accept \u2014 in spite of the mountain of evidence \u2014 that prayers are not at all helpful? , 4 If we didn't get it fixed after Sandy Hook, I doubt we ever will. Thanks to the NRA for building and funding this culture of fear, where the only solution is for more guns., 4 Who is regulating the \"well regulated militia\" ?  , 4 No I am not going to send prayers and no you are not in my thoughts.  That is pointless.  But how can people get up in the morning, send their children to school knowing that they are not safe.  Are Americans that spineless?  Does a sacred cow like the second amendment trump the safety of innocents?  Every American should be ashamed of themselves.  Your politicians will not make a change.  They are funded by the NRA and the arms industry.  Demand a referendum and overturn the second amendment once and for all.  The American people rose up in the sixties and overturned the stupid decision to go into Vietnam.  Rise up again and demand change from your politicians.  And stop having vigils.  This just exacerbates the fantasy.  Face reality:  GUNS KILL.  No more pity:  the murder of innocents in the US is viewed by the world as a farce., 4 The NRA solution is more guns everywhere.  That\u2019s the ticket.  Lots of people with limited training, unsure of who is good and who is bad, shooting rapidly at anything that they \u201cthink\u201d is the bad guy.  Should work out perfect!! LOL, 4 Again.....\n\nOne of the many takeaways of this latest outrage is that a well funded, organized minority, and gun rights people are a minority, can hijack a country and enforce its perverted will on everyone.\n\nThe Nazis did it. The communists did it. And radical right wing Americans are doing it now. Today.\n\nYet you sit, glued to your screens and do nothing. \n\nPathetic., 4 It seems to me it is strictly the NRA that is killing us.  That organization is unsupported by the American People (look at the polls - 90% of Americans want background checks for example).  So the NRA owns many, many of the Congress and threatens to primary any Republican who doesn't tow their line of guns for everyone, no restrictions.  \n\nIf every member of Congress could come together as a group and tell the NRA - \"go ahead, primary us all\" - we might be able to squash this deadly, toxic bug.  John McCain, our war hero, got 7.7 million dollars from the NRA, tops in Congress.  How can a good man like McCain do this any more?\n\nWatching the news after one of these nightmares is like News Porn. I don't watch sex porn and I'm sick to death of watching News Porn, watching/hearing terrorized people.  \n\nWhat is different this time is that people are telling their government to shut up and DO SOMETHING.  We are insane to allow ourselves to be captured by such an organization as the NRA.  Who are we, America?  What are we?\n\nThe kids are speaking up and out and demanding we adults do something.  I demand the Congress consider my plan.  Give up your blood money, all of you tell the NRA to go to hell with their bullying of primarying, and Save Our Children.  \n\nNo more with this death of our babies!, 4 You can't say our leaders have done nothing,..didn't they make it easier for folks like Cruz to buy weapons?\n\nA deranged 19yr old can buy ARs but not a brew?, 4 Guns are very well made, sturdy, reliable objects. The US has very many of them, something like 1 gun per person, with more than half owned by only 3% of the population. So everyone who wants a gun or 30 or 300 has a gun or 30 or 300. Sales of guns have slowed down now that Obama is not in office. So here's the thing. The gun manufacturers are now desperate. Their backs are against the wall. Corporate stock prices depend on rising (not level, not falling) sales.  They certainly give plenty of their piles of money to the 535 people whose job it is to legislate and regulate guns; they could give every bit of profit to these 535 to keep their stock prices up. A few hundred or thousand of our children are as nothing to the price these manufacturers will pay to keep selling unneeded, unwanted and very lethal guns. , 4 Thoughts and prayers from politicians who are glued to the hip of the NRA will never change the situation until all these Republicans and their puppet President are voted out of office. Only through people's voices and votes can we get rid of the men and women who have no shame, no spine and no regard for human life. America, the country of immigrants and progressive ideas, the country of dreams to be made has become a bedrock of racism and violence, especially gun violence. Stand up, resist and vote! , 4     One cannot avoid the conclusion that the NRA is evil and that those politicians who recieve thier money and support have evil in them too.  There will be no gun control. We will have schools as armed camps to \"protect the children.\" Those protectors will be, by and large, ignorant, poorly trained, police wanna-bes who will end up shooting any H. S. kid who they feel disrespects them. More carnage.\n   You think Zimmerman shooting Trayvon was horrific? Wait til you see what happens when idiots like Marco Rubio put this plan in place, 4 \u201ca well regulated militia...\u201d\n\nOwnership of an assault weapon should require membership in the state\u2019s national guard. The weapon should be kept in that guard facility\u2019s armory. \n\nFirearms for home or personal defense should be limited to revolvers and non-automatic long guns, like shotguns and hunting rifles. , 4 Tell your good friend that it is his fault. Tell him with anger and with love that he is to blame for the young innocent lives that were taken. Tell him that without his active gun support or his political apathy this would have been prevented. Tell him that if he owns a gun he should be for gun regulation, not against it. He can see the danger every time he pulls the trigger. Make him understand that it is his fault. Tell him!, 4 Face it, we are a barbaric nation full of people who have been brainwashed by the NRA and the gun manufacturers.  They must have their guns. They must have the guns that are built to kill humans.  Any gun you take away from them is wrong.  More guns and more guns.  I don't understand it and I don't understand their paranoid desire to arm themselves to the teeth in the name of \"defense\" or 2nd Amendment or \"liberty.\"  There is something very wrong here, and our politicians have made it very clear to terrified Americans that they will do nothing to stop this.  So, folks, nothing will happen.  This will continue., 4 States which have citizen's initiatives that can be voted on by the general public must immediately start gathering signatures that ban the possession and sales of any firearm that was designed to be converted to fully automatic or designed for sale to any military organization. If all firearms were limited to six rounds that would give time for people to escape an active shooter or rush the criminal while he was reloading. These two changes would save many lives while keeping firearms available for home protection or hunting. Of course these laws would drive the militia types nuts because they seem to think a few thousand out of shape fifty year olds and untrained kids can defeat the US Army, Air Force and Navy with their AR15s., 4 I weep as I read the news and I refuse to apologize for my tears. But our collective sorrow is not enough.  Our children, our communities and our county are in crisis and we must act. But don't allow this debate to be co-opted by the pro-gun minority. This is not about mental health, this is about guns.  This is about the availability and free access to guns by anyone and everyone. A person who is mentally stable today may be mentally unstable tomorrow. Keeping guns away from the \"mentally ill\" is not the answer. Limiting and banning access to weapons of mass murder as a means to keep our children and communities safe is common sense.  Sorrow is generally followed by anger so let's use our grief to change things now. Remove these weapons from our society., 4 Over and over.\nActual change must come from Congress, which has been held by the GOP for the last 7 years.  But Congress works slowly, regardless of party.\nPractically, the best course for gun change is to change Congress. The GOP has demonstrated since Sandy Hook, about 5 years ago, that they will do nothing. Add that to their growing list of failures, their horrible \"Success\" (tax law), and Dems should all the issues on their side. I hope we can all support their elections.\nElection 2018., 4 All students of the USA- refuse to attend school until Congress passes significant gun control legislation. Voters- do not vote for any candidates who receive money from the NRA., 4 Dear 2nd Amendment proponents: you have a decision to make.\n\nYou can have your kids or have your guns, but not both. \n\nWhich is it? We, and the kids, need your answer., 4 Your congressmen and women have blood on their hands.\nThey must be mentally ill themselves, perhaps on the pyschopathic spectrum, because they let you and your fellow Americans be shot at and die every day by gunshot wounds without doing anything to prevent it.\nProtest! March locally, march to the state capitol, march to Washington DC, contact your congressman or woman to express your horror and disgust at their callous lack of action about the slaughter.\nSomeone has suggested showing graphic photos and footage of the bloodied victims, like for the Vietnam war, to rouse people's anger. Perhaps they should.\nAnd if you have an ounce of compassion Protest! and vote the pyschpaths out of office!, 4 Call a spade a spade. The headline needs to read:  \"Children are shot and buried. Leaders do nothing. Repeat.\"  Prayers never solved one problem, not once.  And prayer NEVER changes behaviors. , 4 We've always crowed to the world about how great democracy is, and by extension how great our system of government is, but really; what an idiotic & morally  bankrupt country we live in, finally; where children aren't sacred but assault rifles are., 4 Don\u2019t forget that gun sales will likely spike after another gun tragedy. , 4 It is really tragic to learn about the deadly school shootings like the latest one in Florida  that often claim several young lives but what's intriguing is reluctance on the part of the lawmakers to even discuss the sensible gun control regulations. , 4 The Republicans are fine with this situation.  We have to keep pointing that out.  We have to vote them out.  It is a national disgrace., 4 An Open Letter To Paul Ryan\n\nDear Sir,\nNow is not the time for knee jerk reactions? What is it the time for, more pandering by gutless self-serving politicians to deep pocketed special interest groups like the NRA? You Sir, and your colleagues, should be ashamed of yourselves for not demanding stricter enforceable gun control NOW. I am a gun owner and like many others want something to be done, anything, to try and prevent these mass shootings from happening again. My cousins where in that school in Parkland, hiding in closets, running past the dead bodies of friends, listening to their classmates calling out for their mothers as they lay dying in the hallways of their school, and but for the grace of God I\u2019m not attending funerals right now. This has to stop. You claim to defend the Constitution, have you even read it? A WELL REGULATED Militia.. You sir, have failed us miserably to regulate and once again our children must die as a result of your inaction. Do your job, step up or step aside., 4 I wonder how many people decry the violence, offer prayers, and then vote for Republicans. , 4 If a shooting massacre were to occur at one of those tony private schools around Washington DC, which many children of Congress attend, then perhaps, maybe, possibly, Congress would do something., 4 Prayers?  Really?  Seriously?  \n\nYou Republicans don't pray. I know that because you have to have a heart to pray.  And Republicans no longer have a heart or a soul. All you Republicans care about is the money you're getting from the NRA!  Dead kids don't bother you. \n\nSo every word that is coming out of your mouth is an added insult to the families of the victims in this massacre.  $3million dollars to Sen Mark Rubio to keep his silence and loyalty.\n$171,000 last election to Paul Ryan to keep silent and pledge loyalty.\n$30 million towards Trump's election for his silence and complicity. \n\nBut to the children of Parkland school, misery and death, and mourning that will never end for the families and friends. , 4 The state of Florida is picking up the tab for funeral expenses.  Will the\nstate pick up the medical and rehabilitation expenses of the survivors?\nMaybe the NRA will offer money. , 4 The media - including the NY Times - are giving Nikolas exactly what he craves: attention and publicity. His name and face are everywhere. He's famous, just like all those other mass murderers. \n\nThese killers are almost always mentally unstable. They want attention, and national recognition is definitely attention.\n\nIf we really want to stop this obscene copycat killing, tell the story, but never mention the shooter's name and never show his face., 4 The U.S. arms industry is truly unique in being the only business that is Constitutionally protected from any government interference by virtue of having its own amendment.  (Well perhaps we could add the press).  Just imagine, for a moment, our country if the auto and drug industries had similar libertarian protection from regulation.  Our Constitution is great but obviously not perfect.  We need a change or clarification to the second Amendment either by the courts or the amendment process., 4 Our need to know vs right to know.  Where's the balance?  We want and need to be aware of what's going on in our nation but I can't help but wonder if the media, by endlessy publishing and showing the events on tv actually hurts us.  All of these deeply disturbed individuals want fame and glory.  Nearly every one of them talks about achieving fame and infamy, and wanting to out do the last one in terms of body count.  Televising and printing it over and over just glorifies it and gives them something to try to out do.\n\nWhere the balance?, 4 Why this repeating cycle?  Because at the end of the day most people believe that these random tragedies will not happen to them.  Unfortunately, it will take more frequent horrific events like Parkland before anything concrete will get done. , 4 Only the top 1% of income earners have the political ability to change how America is governed. They are not threatened by gun violence, and use the 2nd Amendment to create division in order to manipulate democratic participation to enforce their rule. Even when the ruling class is victimized by gun violence, like at Sandy Hook or last year's shooting of Congresspersons, they know they are not threatened as a class by it. Instead of solutions preventing manufacture and mass distribution of fire arms, citizens should expect more screening at their schools, and wherever elites meet the public. The divisiveness the gun lobby has created will continue to be used to split the electorate, and atomize individuals, which has served to create and accelerate the income inequality that provides the ruling class with its power. The civic horror represented by gun violence will be used to increase police authority, but not to protect citizens. Protection of wealth is the only goal of America's rulers.  , 4 Gun laws that will prevent school shootings are urgently necessary and have been for a long time.  In the meantime, the next best thing is to make our schools unavailable to shooters.  Every school in every town and city in every state should lock all the access doors all the time .  (The doors of course would be operational for exit in emergencies.) The front doors need metal detectors and guards.   When some judges were shot, courts put this system in place.  It works.   We don't tell the babysitter to leave the door unlocked, so why do we send our children to schools without ANY security?  It's a sad world but in the absence of moral leadership, defense will help.  , 4 The latest Florida gun shooting is so sad. Unfortunately, I believe it is up to school children to stand up and demand the USA does something about gun control.  School children are being murdered.  They must fight for their lives.  They need to speak out. The youth must organize themselves. And be aware that adults in this country have failed them. They, our school children, are being sacrificed in the pursuit of gun profits... , 4 The NEA and AFT should call for a strike, nationwide. No school until gun control is enacted! It's too dangerous to teach school in America until this massive proliferation of guns in civilian homes is brought under control. I would march with them and I think I would not be alone., 4 The Republicans refer frequently to 2nd Amendment Rights. The origin of the Second Amendment, with its language on Well Ordered Militias, invites scrutiny: what purpose the militias? Answer: Slavery, and the fear of slave owners of slave revolts which the owners needed weaponry to suppress. Yet another constitutional compromise over slavery, having no relevance to the 21st century and the sorry state this country finds itself in, with its oversaturation of automatic weapons. The only solution for this is to vote these enablers of gun violence out of office. With due respect for Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan et al, now is the time for a pitched political battle over gun rights and violence., 4 Our politicians should follow our President's advice. Our President should follow his own advice. So many signs...and yet they do nothing., 4 Non-Americans reading this: boycott the USA in protest over its politicians' callous inaction on gun control by not visiting it.\nUnless you must visit for work or family, don't go there.\nThese politicians need a wake up call. They only appear motivated by money, and as Americans are not storming the Capitol in protest at the slaughter, let the rest of the world express our desire for an end to this slaughter by witholding our tourist dollars until they come to their senses., 4 We already know of the inane excuses, deflections, and inaction from half of Congress. We need to hear about the ideas and plans the other half are suggesting. Let's focus on the responsible members of Congress and what they say, because that is how we learn who to vote for. , 4 If gun laws weren't enacted when 20 BABIES were killed in Newtown, CT, and their parents went to DC to plead with their representatives to pass regulations, I fear we will continue to live this nightmare again and again., 4 For all of you who think that anyone can respond to a shooter by shooting back is delusional. The shooter has a plan, you don't. I was held up at my business by a person who had served a \"life sentence \" for murder and was out of prison.he entered my store with his gun drawn. If I had a gun and reached for it I would be dead.\nArming teachers would be a foolish idea, this guy was in the middle of a bunch of children, even a sharpshooter wouldn't be able to hit this target.\nIt's time to elect people who are not beholden to the NRA., 4 As a mother, I will not be voting for any republican in 2018 or 2020. , 4 My \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d are directed in one direction. Praying that all Republicans (and Democrats too) who do not support the banning and confiscation of assault weapons are swiftly removed from Congress.  And I will put those prayers in action by actively campaigning for local and national candidates who support this one issue. It is time for \u201cwe the people\u201d to demand our right to the pursuit of happiness which cannot be realized under this tyranny of gun violence.  , 4 Nikolas Cruz turned to a hate group to feel he \"belonged\".  The group knew he was lonely.  So many of the school shootings have been perpetrated by retaliatory young men alienated from our society: Adam Lanza, the Columbine killers, the killer in today's headlines, ... To get to the root causes, we must also address the greater issues of bullying and social isolation.   This scope also includes the Patriots Day bombing in Boston, the mad doctor in Texas, perhaps even Las Vegas. This encompasses what is the much greater scope of the successful solutions discussed in the RAND study \"How Terrorist Groups End\".  The pot will continue to boil until we put out the flame. , 4 Mercenaries are by definition \"primarily concerned with material reward at the expense of ethics.\" Again we see proof here that our legislatures and even our executive mansions are full of NRA  Mercenaries - house members and senators, governors, presidents, lobbyists, etc. People who accept massive funding from the NRA and related groups, while offering nothing but their platitudes and prayers in each incident of this type.\n\nWhat good are the prayers of someone who is professionally unethical, who enabled the killers? \n\nWe must defeat this army of NRA Mercenaries and those who traffic in death by selling arms to anyone. Never vote for them until we have a national registry of those not allowed to own guns and universal background checks. Children are restricted from many things by law because they are underage. Why not gun possession/ownership?, 4 \"national paralysis over the Second Amendment.\" This quote from the article, sums it up. Nothing will change for you because there is no price too high to be paid, self evidently, (to which the routine massacre of innocents bears witness and confirms) to maintain an arcane piece of legislation, drafted when replacement teeth were made of wood. It would be funny if it weren't so tragic. A first world country with a third world view of basic human priorities. Mindboggling and utterly obscene in its depravity., 4 The flag over the People's House is now flying at half staff in honor of the people massacred in the latest gun shooting.\n\nIt's a very sad day when we now need to routinely lower the flag to honor ordinary American citizens doing the ordinary things of life, like going to school, worshipping in church, or attending a concert, who are killed under increasingly ordinary circumstances! What is so honorable about being murdered by a fellow citizen practicing his right to own an assault rifle?\n\nMight as well keep the flag at half staff... it is now meaningless in a routine kind of way., 4 I am debating spending this holiday weekend creating \"cards\" to send to the Republican leaders in Congress and maybe the leaders of the NRA.\n\nThey would have pictures of the victims and say things like \"You are responsible for this,\" \"Stop praying and start acting,\" \"God has already answered your prayers with gun control legislation -- you just aren't listening,\" and \"You allowed a man with a mental illness to purchase an assault rifle and this is what happened.\"\n\nBecause all of those things are true.\n\nWe cannot allow these people to deny their culpability in these tragedies anymore.  I'm sick of their platitudes and empty words.  I'm sick of the nonsensical \"the guns aren't the problem\" line.  Of COURSE the guns are the problem -- it doesn't really take a lot of sense to know that.\n\nThey hold the power and they are responsible.  We need to make them feel that responsibility., 4 When the collective conscience of a country is mentally ill, it is impossible to notice metal illness. When we are all living in a social psychological break with sanity, insanity becomes normality. When a country gives Donald Trump control of the largest nuclear arsenal in the history of mankind, how can we begin to discuss gun control.  , 4 We weep with you and share your unfathomable pain.  \n\nCondolences.  Repeated 17 times.\n\nThings must change.  Now is the time and we are the heartbroken and angry people to do it., 4 Helpless hand wringing about the power of the NRA is another predictable part of the ritual. Why not do something different this time? Form a foundation with the sole goal to oppose the NRA. Collect $100 from everyone who agrees with this article, plus support from some sympathetic billionaire, and you'll have a sizable war chest. Then promise that every politician supported by the NRA will have twice the amount of money running against him. No better time to start than now, especially given all the fresh talent willing to run in the midterm elections. , 4 To all those lawmakers who pray for the fallen. I think you're prayers have been answered. You're just not listening. The purpose of guns is not to protect people but to kill them. We have more guns in this country than any other nation on Earth. Consequently we have more gun violence. Is your right to bear arms, greater than some one else's right to live?, 4 Isn\u2019t our constitutional right to \u201cLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness\u201d being taken away by a domestic terrorist organization, the NRA? Don\u2019t they terrorize anyone who does not support their agenda of promoting and selling weapons of mass destruction? I\u2019m puzzled as to why we the majority of Americans that support sensible gun laws and banning weapons of mass destruction don\u2019t vote out every member of congress that continues to be a slave for the NRA! After all a Republican President sent us into a war half way around the world with the pretense of destroying weapons of mass destruction, but they won\u2019t do it here where they are a reality., 4 We must vote out the NRA AKA Republicans, 4 The Problem: Republicans in Congress. Solution: Remove them. Period., 4 We watch in awe as the story repeats itself and nothing changes- a 19 year old is not allowed to legally buy a beer but is able to buy an assault weapon and kill 17 people.....-\nI wonder when politics will take responsibility and start a bipartisan approach to end this nightmare, putting the interest and safety of kids over the monetary interests of the gun lobby.   Unbelievable .... and scary ate the same time.\n\nWe should all put pressure on Congressmen and Senators to end this and call the problem by name and address it.\n\nWe pray for those who are hurt and for the lives lost., 4 Thoughts and prayers really means shut up, we're not going to do anything., 4 Three times/year, for the past few years, I've sat huddled in a corner of the classroom with a group of 6-year-olds, trying to stay quiet, whispering reassurance that if any \"bad people\" got into our school, we'd be safe behind our locked door.  I simply can't imagine how badly I'd have felt if any of them were shot.  Or imagine how badly the teachers and parents must feel who have lost children.  Do we really love our guns more than we love our kids?  Please, let's do something to stop this killing., 4 I bet the majority of the victims\u2019 families are gun owners and gun-right supporters. I\u2019d like to know if they are going to change now in view of the tragedies that struck their own families. This could be a good research project., 4 I would like the NY Times, the Washington Post, and other big and small city newspapers to publish OFTEN the names of senators and congressmen and congresswomen who have taken or continue to take huge amounts of money from the NRA.  I hear their names on TV but miss some of the names as they are not on a list or in an article.  For the sake of all of us, publish the names of those who take money from the NRA and show how much they have gotten.  I hear it on TV, why don't I see it in print?  Then I and others can know who never to vote for again.  And AR-15 have got to be banned NOW., 4 History will highlight this period of the world's steep decline of respect for the United States and the internal decay and divisiveness eroding our society. The causes, in part, will be attributed to our abnormal, unhealthy attachment to guns, especially semiautomatic weapons; the shameful abdication of responsible action for gun control laws by legislators bought by NRA money; and the normalization of school shootings. What a legacy!, 4 Show pictures of the victims.  It worked to change minds on Vietnam.  Show pictures of the slaughtered kids, splayed out in hallways and classrooms where moments before their young minds roamed free.  Textual depictions can not compete with the visual reality.\n\nShow pictures of the victims. , 4 The thoughts and prayers, however well intentioned (if self-serving: Wonderful Me! Compassionate Me! Caring Me!), don't seem to be helping much. If you have time for a candlelight vigil, you have time to volunteer at the schools in whatever capacity is necessary to help prevent what is becoming all too common occurrences., 4 Even articles like this one, reflecting on our sad American ritual, have now become part of that futile ritual., 4 It would seem helpful for all media to stop showing pictures of the shooter or even identify their name., 4 What I have come to realize is that most GOP members of Congress just aren't very intelligent. Yes they are cowards and shills for their corporate sponsors, but they also simply aren't smart enough to even debate, let alone fix, complex problems., 4 He LEGALLY purchased the AK-15. I cannot come to terms with this. He legally purchased a semi-automatic weapon. And the Congress allows this to happen.  They are enablers . They are complicit.  , 4 The problem is that there has never been a workable solution offered. Ban this and ban that is not something the American public would accept and/or follow. Americans even refuse to have national ID cards! So offer a realistic solution and then we can start to discuss it., 4 Until real progress is made on this national nightmare, I suggest just because someone owns a gun, they may not be fit to possess it. Take the guns away at the first sign of trouble. Moms and wives, you can and should do this. , 4 I remember being revolted when gun sales soared after Sandy Hook. And then came the \"hoaxers.\" At that point, I really lost confidence that anything would change. We can try to work for change through the ballot, we can even some day muzzle the NRA. But there are too many guns out there, and too many angry, angry men. Some enormous cultural change, the sort that takes a century to organize, must take place.  And it will have to attack not only the culture of guns but also the rogue, terrorist culture of the berserk men who mishandle them.  , 4 I think it\u2019s time for Americans to realize that thoughts and prayers just don\u2019t cut it and in my opinion and at this point it is a more than a bit insulting. Politicians might as well tape the expression and have an aid play it back so they don\u2019t even have to discuss it since it\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t care enough to do anything\nThe mental health issue they all fall back on is a pure cop out. There are crazy people all over in all countries. There\u2019s no way we will be able to find all these people prior to them doing their crazy things. Only in the US are these crazy people allowed access to the weapons needed to perform these horrific crimes. Spineless politicians are the obvious problem. , 4 Prayers = lip service. Worse than useless., 4 Here's a great idea (not mine, unfortunately) for expressing your disgust with your elected representative's reaction to all the mass shootings. Take a personal check, redact the routing and account numbers, and make it out to your rep and in the dollar amount write \"Thoughts and Prayers\". In the memo section write \"Campaign contribution\". Then enclose a note that says \"Dear Rep. ____, Since you and your colleagues in Congress seem to feel that this is the solution to mass murder, please accept this contribution\"., 4 Just more collateral damage to the Republican party and their paymasters at the NRA. it will go on forever., 4 Our thoughts and prayers are with those members of Congress who have just been fired from their jobs. Our thoughts and prayers are with the antiquated NRA and its pathetic base of right wing older males who will no longer have their gun rights over the deaths of children.  Our thoughts and prayers are with a do-nothing president who is treasonous in his collaboration with Russia meddling into our election., 4 Every politician who takes any donation from the NRA should be ousted from serving in government., 4 I think USA looked at the wrong place when it looked for the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. , 4 Does this cycle of mass-murder never end in the USA? \n\nThe 2nd amendment (Dec 15th, 1791) is out of sync with modern times!\nDemocrates and Republicans should be ashamed by their own pandering to the NRA.\n\nSTEP UP, grab the bull by the horns, and change the way things are ! , 4 If I am a Russian spy looking to undermine the USA, I help Trump, the Republicans, and the NRA.\nPutin and Kim Jun Un must be so giddy., 4 American culture= AR-15, 4 School shooting, words that don\u2019t belong together., 4 Recent news articles revealed that terror groups laugh at us because it is so easy to procure weapons here.  Our worst terrorist organization is the NRA.  And the greatest terror threat resides in the White House., 4 Change the name from school to womb. Republicans care about lives inside wombs but not schools., 4 Dear Editors: Next time you print a headline about who is responsible for a shooting, please show the names of the people with the most blood on their hands -- our representatives in Congress, backed by the NRA and unwilling to keep weapons of mass destruction out of our economy. Please show their names and their votes front and center. Everytime. The name of the particular shooter can be a sub-headline, but the \"big guns\" in Congress should be front and center. , 4 Dear Editors: Want to change the politics of the gun issue overnight? Publish the photos of the dead students lying in schoolrooms and hallways. Bring the horror to every breakfast table and break room in the country. Do it every time there is a mass shooting. Fill the nation with dread and rage against the fake sympathy and phony arguments of the politicians who have sold their souls to the NRA. Ever notice how cockroaches scurry for cover when the lights go on?, 4 Have all the prayers after school shootings done any good?   Have any of them been answered?   We need fewer prayers and more action., 4 Accepting the reality that guns - legal, illegal, BB gun to AR-15 and beyond - are here to stay is the first step to the most practical available solution: every school needs to be equipped with metal detectors and security personnel as part of the federal military budget.  Estimated costs appear reasonable.  NYC could certainly serve as a model.  \n\nNo one would choose to live like this unless forced to, but sadly we have been well beyond that point for quite some time. , 4 Everything said is true. It's also just more ranting into the face of a giant wall of MONEY, to which all politicians must bow and pay homage to.\n\nJust another day in the slow but steady self-destruction of the United States of America. Don't expect it to change one iota as long a MONEY = GOD. , 4 This is American carnage. \n\nOur children are routinely murdered in their schools. Our people are routinely murdered in their churches, at concerts, at movie theaters and nightclubs; it happens again and again and again. And,  yet we do nothing.\n\nThis is our real American carnage. , 4 President Trump said to the children \"you are not alone\". Should we be surprised that is another lie? They were and are absolutely alone. That is why they are dead. They have been left alone with malice of forethought on the alter of greed and selfishness. The only ones not alone in all this are those in the warm and comforting embrace of NRA money machine whether profit or funding. And the NRA says, if you don't want to be alone buy a gun to protect yourself from those we happily sold a gun to yesterday. Your gun will keep you company and you won't be alone., 4 Go to the ballot box.  Vote against every Republican candidate because supporting the current Republican party at any level is immoral.  No prayers necessary.  Repeat., 4 A country awash in Trump and in assault weapons is not the America any of us recognize., 4 Florida teachers & students need to be standing along Mr. Trump's route from the airport to Mar-a-Lago. Republican party - remember that these kids will be eligible to vote in a few years., 4 Can we please stop the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d nonsense?\n\nIn the unlikely case there is a God, he is obviously not listening. Prayer is demonstrably useless.\n\nAs for thoughts - thinking is equally useless unless you do something.\n\nCompared to any and all developed modern democracies In the world, the US rate of gun deaths and mass shootings is astronomical.\nAll those other countries have effective gun control policies. This is not, as the NRA and its political lackeys claim, a \u201cmental health issue\u201d.\nAll those other countries have equal issues with mental health.\n\nIt\u2019s always, only, ever been about the guns.\nDo something now or accept the tens of thousands of innocent deaths as the price of your largely-fictional \u201cfreedoms\u201d., 4 And the best this country has to offer in response are:\nThe GOP leadership\nThe NRA\nand, above all\nDonald Trump\nAnd more and better AR15s., 4 Music concerts, movie theaters , nightclubs, high schools, elementary schools, and churches.  Mass shootings have become the national pastime in the United States of America and the only way this savagery will stop is if the lawmakers and policy makers who support or receive support from the NRA are voted OUT OF OFFICE!!  We are beyond the point of having civilized discussions as they yield no results and we just wait until the next lunatic with an arsenal of weapons and ammo goes off and starts shooting everyone in sight.  Why are we the only so called civilized country in the world that permits this carnage?  We have a body of politicians who do not seem fazed at all by these horrific events and just spit out the same rhetoric over and over again.  It's time for we the people to send them a very strong message that we will not allow our citizens, families, and children to be walking targets for these madmen who seem to have NO TROUBLE AT ALL obtaining lethal weapons. The time is now folks.  , 4 Congress, stop banning the CDC scientists from studying gun violence and start banning assault rifles., 4 All this talk about \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d gives me no comfort whatsoever. If the slaughter of innocents Sandy Hook did not stir the so called \u201clawmakers\u201d to action nothing will. It is said that \u201cGod helps those who help themselves\u201d so it is time Americans elected people who will put the safety of children ahead of the donations of the NRA. November 6 is Election Day, don\u2019t miss it., 4 Lets dispense with the false equivalency that all of Congress or our government is at fault for these recurring tragedies. REPUBLICAN memebers of Congress and State Legislatures are the ones who take the NRAs 30 pieces of silver and then wash their hands of guilt with hollow thoughts and prayers. This is not rocket science America, you want change? vote the GOP out of office in 2018., 4 What makes this article so cutting - it feels like an opinion piece, but it\u2019s merely straight reportage of a collection of terrible facts.\n\nAnd that should tell us something., 4 It may be difficult to identify students who have mental health problems or issues in school or at home, but we can certainly determine their age. While most states forbid the sale of alcohol to minors under the age of 21, why can an 18 year old purchase an assault weapon? Let's start there and pass legislation to prevent the sale of these weapons to the underage. Maybe a small step, but at least it gives us the opportunity to offer more than prayers., 4 It breaks my heart to know another gun violence issue has occurred. Parents are pleading to Trump to stop this issue and to actively take a stance for a reform. Republicans need to stop blaming people with mental illness for gun violence and take action to protect the safety of society by imposing a change to the second amendment. , 4 The NRA is a manufacturers lobby, their mission is to sell more product.  It is the mission of citizens to change the paradigm., 4 Mass shootings have become out of control and people like Marco Rubio who believe sensible gun regulation would not have prevented this tragedy are a danger to our democracy. \n\nPlease NY Times, publish an article identifying those Senators and Congressmen who take campaign funding from the NRA so that we may vote this insensitive and greedy lawmakers out of office., 4 How sad. Ok I'm numb to these events now. The clueless in government are incapable of representing anything but corporations and the 1%; so nothing will change. \n\nMoving on., 4 As a nation we are unable to protect our children and unwilling to do anything about it., 4 This is the price of freedom, America. Freedom does not budge. Collateral deaths from American citizens lawfully purchasing guns are proof that we are free, and are a small price to pay for the constitutionally mandated, God-given right to own an instrument of death.  \n\nThese deaths are further a manifestation of a free (more freedom) market economy in a healthy, thriving gun industry. Capitalism cannot be restrained or prevented from its God-given destiny of profit. The divinely-sanctioned (natural) goal of profit should know no restriction concerning the means to that profit. Profit is profit.  Freedom is freedom. And God will reward those who work hard. As for why God would allow mass carnage as the result of his divinely sanctioned process \u2013 well, that\u2019s the beauty of it. He works in mysterious ways. And that mystery is part of his perfection (it\u2019s a perfect mystery); it\u2019s part of the perfection of freedom and the perfection of laissez-faire capitalism.  It\u2019s America perfected and free. \n\nWhy is there any confusion over this at all?, 4 Maybe if Americans are numb to the stories of mass shootings, they should see the results. Let\u2019s see if pictures of the bodies where they lay could spark the outrage necessary to actually do something beyond \u201cthoughts and prayers.\u201d  You can\u2019t argue that we can\u2019t because we are a civilized country. Obviously we aren\u2019t. Let the politicians and their constituents see the results of their inaction. , 4 The lack of will on many fronts to confront gun issues is tearing apart our social fabric. Civic life is being pulled to pieces because Congress, lobbyists, and all the others who put the dry words of the second amendment above the lives of children will not, cannot act. Will parents continue to send their kids to school and choose to teach them at home instead? People long for sensible controls on guns and the people who own them. That this country cannot get this done is an indictment on us all. , 4 The most effective if not only way to stop shootings is to criminalize by a federal law the manufacture of certain firearms. Once they are in circulation it's too late. The Colt AR-15 used in this and other shootings is a civilian version of the US military's M16 rifle. What is, and why is there, a \"civilian version\"?, 4 I am not going to say the 2cnd amendment needs to be repealed (as some are now saying). Most people ARE responsible gun owners and use them for appropriate recreational or defensive purposes as some in my own family do.\n\nBut there has to be a serious adult discussion here about limitations for the good of society that don\u2019t trample on the second amendment. That IS possible and has been done in the past.\n\nBut that can not be done while politicians take huge amounts of money from the NRA. I want to hear what senator Rubio thinks about all of this when he is NOT receiving $3 million from the NRA. There is no reasonable discussion in Congress that can be had, at least on THIS subject, with that level of money sloshing around congress. \n\nSome brave congressperson needs to publicly eschew their donation from the NRA and set an example. Even of they defend gun ownership, it would be more resonant then saying it after they have deposited their $3 million check. , 4 Treat guns like cars:\n\n- require a test and licence to safely operate one (the test could include a psychological assessment and background check);\n\n- require a registration permit whenever and wherever guns are sold, and an annually renewable licence to use the gun in public;\n\n- require individual liability insurance be maintained on all licensed weapons;\n\n- allow gun manufacturers to be open to liability claims by victims of gun misuse where the design of the weapon encourages or enables such misuse;\n\n- Make public possession and use of an unregistered, unlicensed, or uninsured gun a criminal offence.\n\nAdopting such policies would create a climate where insurance companies and the courts could make real strides in resolving the issues., 4 There's a Catch 22 in preventing those with mental health histories from obtaining guns. Individuals who might benefit from treatment who own guns and who want to become gun owners, would avoid seeking mental health care.\nI don't understand this gun fetish. Teaching your young children to use guns, going to the gun range a family-bonding experience. And my family has not been spared from gun violence. My maternal grandfather was shot by an addict when I was 18 months old, and he died in my mother's arms when she was only 23., 4 It's time for our leaders to include in their thoughts and prayers prayers for the strength and courage to take action to end this senseless violence and to pray for the guidance to enact effective laws to help the mentally ill and to enact effective gun control laws/, 4 When did the NRA and the right to own a gun become more important than the physical, emotional and mental well-being - the lives - of our children?\n\nOur children now have to run drills in school so they know what to do in the event of a shooting! They have to regularly contemplate the possibility of being shot in their own school. Hullo? \n\nDo we not believe that actuality significantly impacts them emotionally? Psychologically? To be unsafe in their own school? To look forward to a living in a society in which their safety - their lives - are valued less than guns, politics, and campaign money?\n\nIt is a national disgrace. Where is our humanity? Our will to make change? \n\nIt is clear change will not come from the top down. So, it must come from the bottom up. It must come from us.\n\nCall your all of your representatives today and tell them you will not vote for them if they don't do what it takes to change this now. Ask your friends and family to do the same. It's that simple., 4 And so it comes down to his: \n\nIncreased security measures in school, up to and including fortifying schools to the point that they look and feel like prisons.\n\nTraining and arming teachers.\n\nHaving more armed personnels in the school.\n\nDevoting more talk and no concrete actions towards tackling mental health issues in the student population.\n\nAt this point, all this sudden attention towards what SCHOOLS should be doing to keep their students safe is analogous to blaming a woman for being raped because she was wearing \"revealing\" clothing. \n\nI am a teacher. I teach CHILDREN in a SCHOOL that is supposed to be inviting, safe and dedicated towards producing the next generation of engaged citizens. \n\nI refuse to carry ANY weapons to my school. It goes against everything a SCHOOL stands for.\n\nThe root of the epidemic school mass shootings lies not in the school side or the victims. Do not deflect the blame onto us. Do not believe for a single moment that the security kabuki being bantered about will help at all. If the powers that be can't even provide us the money to buy COPY PAPER, what makes you think my classroom will get all around proof glass?\n\nIt's the GUNS. It's always the GUNS. The GUNS are everywhere. Ultimately, we have decided at Sandy Hook that our right to own guns trump my students' rights to being alive. , 4 While our government leaders are so conditioned after every mass murder at uttering words and prayers, they sit in their lofty perches of their state houses and federal offices and buildings, protected by armed police----while millions of children sit unprotected in their school rooms, vulnerable to an attack by someone who has a legally purchased assault rifle.\n\nIt is time for all of our elected officials to heed the words of Martin Luther King. Jr. who said,\n\n\u201cThere comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is right.\u201d\n\nToo many of our elected leaders are without a conscience.\n\nShould those 'leaders' fail to take appropriate action now and pass tougher gun laws, then let us as citizens choose new leaders whose conscience will implore them to break the cycle by acting to help prevent such gun violence in the future. \n\n., 4 Citizens should petition that House and Senate Chaplains, in their morning prayer opening their respective Chamber's business for the day, insist that there be specific and meaningful actions taken by Congress to curb this epidemic of gun slaughter in America. Let them supplement these prescriptive demands upon the gathered Representatives and Senators with pictures of the innocent victims of gun violence, particularly children, accompanied by their life stories. \n\nEnough with the usual religious bromides and any self-imposed clerical restraint not to delve into political matters! If not now, when? These Chaplains have a unique opportunity from their Capitol \"bully pulpit\", on a recurring basis, to take the moral imperative for gun legislation directly to the assembled before them. If controversy follows, so be it. Let the iconic activism of Reverend Martin Luther King be their lodestar., 4 One of the greatest losses in the past decades in the US in the loss of common sense that, combined with the existing gun obsession will make it almost impossible to change anything resembling a tight gun control. Children accidently kill each other, adolescences kill other students with combat weapons and angry adults kill masses with an arsenal of combat weapons. Having lived in one of Americas greatest cities, in Boston, I met wonderful people and learned a lot about American history that was largely build on respect, pragmatism and common sense. What we see today in American policy is not only the loss of common sense but also the deny of truth or facts as well as the advent of alternative facts and obvious lies that appear to define a new low standard in politics. The country of unlimited opportunities became a country of unlimited opportunities to kill each other due to the abundance of guns and combat rifles. Unless an amendment of the constitution limits the access to guns there will be no end for the highest gun violence as compared to other developed countries. But for such approach you need the common sense in the American society and in American policy. Today, the common sense appears to be limited to \"thoughts and prayers\" followed by inaction., 4 My generation of baby boomers and the next generation of Gen Xers have failed our children. Whatever happened to peace, love, our bodies ourselves, what color is your parachute? To protesting and changing the course of a vile war? To attempting to end inequality?  To rational gun policies where we care more about life than the NRA?  How do we continue to let politicians supported by the NRA remain in office where they\ncontinue to vote down reasonable gun control simply to perpetuate their own never-ending presence in Congress?  Please millennials vote us out of office. Show us a better way. We are contemptible failures. We worship nothing but power and money. We deserve to be retired.  , 4 If you are going to pray, then pray for something useful that will bring more meaning to the memory of the victims of this pointless violence.  Pray that politicians supporting the second amendment will learn to care about the children in our country and impose strict gun laws., 4 Hearts are breaking at the loss of so many lives of innocent children who were doing something we all must do as children -- go to school to learn. There is a gun problem in the USA obviously. Please, Americans, gather your will to protect children and others and vote out everyone who supports the NRA. They are the problem along with the guns they so love. , 4 I'm sorry folks, but this is not a good country., 4 Vote EVERY republican lawmaker out of congress and local gov't.  They are all on the NRA gun lobby take and will not change implement common sense gun laws because they are on the take.  This will not change until they are voted out of office.  American voters need to make that happen.  Vote!, 4 These NRA-controlled politicians disgust me. They only make matters worse with their crocodile tears and phony prayers. If they really cared they would act to remove weapons of war from our streets and schools. The only purpose of an AR-15 and the like is to commit mayhem and destroy multiple lives in a heartbeat. Politicians who refuse to act are complicit in these heinous assaults against innocents. Their \"prayers and thoughts\" are insulting. , 4 If I hear one more politician offer throughts and prayers I may never stop throwing up.  They do not care.  A great many of our citizens do not care.  They don't even want to \"pay for other peoples kids to go to school' much less care about whether they live or not.\n\nThose of us who do care are held hostage by killers.  Murderers have more rights than our school children.  Just ask any dead child.\n\nAnd the Gun Lovers and the NRA think that's just fine.  They support murder, pure and simple.\n\nThis country is sick, and getting sicker by the day., 4 Children shot.\nTeenagers killed.\nCongressmen paralyzed and gunned down.\nConcert goers massacred.\n\nThere is no more room for thoughts and prayers.  Time to change things ourselves. , 4 Once an organization promoting gun safety training for youths, the NRA has devolved into a home grown American Terrorist Organization.  How many Americans have been killed because of their ideology?  Far more than by foreign terrorists., 4 The shooter in FL was part of a white nationalist group, and was even trained as part of their militia. Let's not say he's just a troubled kid. They are all domestic terrorists. , 4 This is the only country that sanctions the killing of innocents. Sanctions it by not enacting common sense gun laws that the majority of citizens are asking for from their legislators. I could not believe it when Paul Ryan uttered the GOP mantra yet again...\u201dThis is not the time to jump to some conclusion not knowing the full facts\u201d. Really, this is your response to yet another home-grown tragedy?!! When will it be time to act, Speaker Ryan? When 100 more have been killed? 500? 1000? Let us know when the correct number has been reached for you to finally come to your senses!, 4 PBS News Hour had a review of all of the mass shootings of the past 30 years since Colimbine, and the mostly aborted legislative efforts to restrict or put some sort of controls on the sale of these weapons. Whenever they reported on the various attempts, it was always \"the bill died in Comgress,\" or \"the bill was never sent to the floor of the House\" or \"the Senate did not pass the bill,\" Not once - NOT ONCE - was the word REPUBLICAN mentioned. These efforts were all defeated by REPUBLICANS. As though the blame for these failures were equally shared by both parties which it decidedly is not. This willfull and frankly vile false equivalency in the media - including the Times - is another obscene corrosion of our democracy. The failure to get any meaningful gun control in this country lies on the shoulders of one part and one party alone: the bought and bribed REPUBLICAN  Party, more a criminal organization then a political party, one that is wholly owned and ordered about by their owners, the NRA and the Koch Brothers. The failure of PBS to point this out is obscene and pathetic. The only hope of getting any gun control is for Americans to go to the polls in massive numbers and rid our nation from top to bottom, from the courthouse to the White House, of the depraved grip of the Republican Criminal Organization. Removing these shameless political prostitutes from the government they profess to so hate  is the only hope for the survival of what's left of our democracy. , 4 I think US policians should bluntly say that nothing can be done to prevent the occurrence of these massacres. At least they won't be hypocrite. , 4 Thoughts and prayers are worthless, especially coming from people who fight every effort to prevent these tragedies., 4 Our elected officials are all bluster.  The Republicans talk a big game want to address mental health, but they really don't care how many people are killed.  All they want to do is offer prayers and what good has THAT done??????????  You might as well not acknowledge it at all, in fact I'd prefer you didn't rather that continuing to insult our intelligence with your \"prayers\".  , 4 All  our nation has become is an aerial camera capture of children being led out of buildings with hands in the air and police with assault rifles. #NOMORENRA, 4 Prayers don\u2019t seem to be working. God is apparently impotent to do anything, not interested, or entirely malevolent. Perhaps we should start relying on common sense instead of vaporware. , 4 Follow the money.  Follow the money.  Make it illegal for any political candidate or already elected politician to receive money from the NRA or any other gun organizations or fronts for the NRA.  That would be a start.  But in America, it's almost always Follow the money to get to the root of a problem. Money is power. Period., 4 Until voters decide that the madness of allowing any person access to an assault rifle is important enough to vote for sensible gun control we will continue to have these events.  We are the only 1st world nation willing to put up with the killing of our children so that gun manufacturers can keep making money.  And the elected officials who accept the donations of the NRA, an organization who's sole purpose to to serve the gun manufacturers profit, have blood on their hands.  \n\nStand up and vote for better candidates and donate money to for sensible GUN CONTROL laws.   , 4 Is it possible to do something about gun violence and if so, what would it take? As a 16 yr old who survived the Douglas shooting said, obviously what we're doing now isn't working.\n\nAre there things we could do? Absolutely. Universal background checks, banning assault weapons, a gun registration database, liability insurance - to name a few. \n\nAre we willing to try? Obviously not. When you have pols like Marco Rubio, who has accepted millions of dollars from the NRA, saying not to assume this could have been prevented, discussion is halted before it begins. When you have pols like Paul Ryan saying we need all the data and not to have a knee-jerk reaction, the message is clear: we will not do anything.\n\nIs it hopeless? I hope not. We should have massive demonstrations to support gun control. We should vote for strong proponents of gun control. We should never give up or give in. , 4 \nWhile I believe some degree of emotional comfort comes from \"a nation [that sends] thoughts and prayers\", it's ACTION, not words, that is required to prevent another tragedy.  To all lawmakers of this country - PLEASE ban the sale and possession of ALL assault rifles to private citizens.   I will beg, if necessary, if that's what it takes to get these weapons off the street and out of the gun shops., 4 We are grieved, angry, and the Right refuses to listen as long as we remain quiet.  All \"Moments of Silence\" in response to gun violence should be upended by all of us who are sick of the status quo - let's allow ourselves to break the silence with weeping, screaming, and loud demands for change.  , 4 I looked at a flag at half mast yesterday and this thought jumped into my head, that red, white and blue isn't flying low out of a sense of mourning, it's flying low out of shame. , 4 One of the un-stated reasons Americans have guns is to protect themselves - from their government.\n\nBecause the government is a military government whose modus operandi is extreme violence Americans feel like they need weapons capable of countering that type of threat.\n\nLike it or not, that is how many people feel.\n\nMany Americans think that their government engages in long-term, large-scale operations designed to shape and control the mental space, the dialogue around guns.\n\nThey feel, rightly or wrongly, that violent incidents are either manufactured or leveraged to manage public perception around guns in order to get Americans to force each other to disarm and render themselves incapable of self defense - defense against their own government.\n\nAt the same time that same government embraces the money the NRA gives them, which seems to counter the movement toward disarmament. \n\nThis schizophrenic situation wherein the people and the government are both at odds with themselves and each other is perfectly illustrated in the debate/screeching that occurs in the press and public fora surrounding every event.\n\nWhen we are afraid of each other, a situation purposefully nurtured by those who benefit from that situation, we cannot communicate because we do not want to. \n\nAnd so we retreat and retrench into virtual enclaves of like-mindedness, wherein we are equally afraid of each other.\n\nI don't see this changing., 4 Mr. Trump made a speech at the CIA in front of their memorial.  There is a star for each person who has given their life in the service of our country.  Sadly if we placed a star for each victim of gun violence in front of Congress they most likely look away as they have done with each new incident., 4 Rubio does not care about the lives of his constituents, he cares about receiving NRA money.  Trump does not care about the loss of life of American citizens, he cares about, pleasing his base who in turn gratifying his ego.  We have been down the same path over and over again.  \"Thought and Prayer\" from the politicians has become an insults to victims and their families.  Anger and sadness will not get us anywhere, throwing the minions of the NRA out of the office in November is what all of us can do to honor the victims., 4 I'd like to take a survey:\nWould every survivor of gun violence, or the surviving parent/spouse of a dead victim of gun violence, please raise your hands if you feel that your loss was the small price we pay for the freedom to own and use firearms AKA the 2nd amendment.\nOkay.\nAnybody?\nI thought so., 4 Trump omitted mention of gun control but he did say something about mental health in his speech to the nation about the latest (but not the last) school massacre.  Now we know he won't do anything about THAT either., 4 Here we go again: The United States Congress is directly responsible for the school massacre in Florida.\nThe politicians dodge any responsibility or accountability for making gun laws that protect school children; however, theses same political cowards greedily accept the waves of money from the National Rifle Association, who actually run the Congress.\nThe US Congress and The National Rifle Association Association have put our school children in immenient, life threatening danger by stonewalling legislation that would help curb school gun violence that keeps killing our children.\nInstead the Congress does nothing to protect our children; but, these miscreant politicians take NRA money to keetheir political careers alive.\nThank you Don Trump, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio and the Remaining bunch of Republican clowns for avoiding your sworn duty to protect this country., 4 I'm sick of watching leaders organize feel-good post-shooting events to vent emotions and then watching the media hype it all. \n\nIt's time to do something like ban gun ownership to all but honorably discharged veterans or ban semi-auto rifles and high capacity magazines. The writers of the Constitution would have never tolerated these acts in the name of freedom., 4 Perhaps some brilliant lawyer will find a way to bring a class action suit representing the families of victims of gun violence against every lawmaker who takes money from the NRA and the NRA for conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nPerhaps some brilliant psychologist will point out that a country that lives by the gun -- buying and selling weapons all over the country and all over the world, spending vast amounts of money on Offense, and on a nuclear arsenal, electing a president supported by the NRA, who seems to have confused his \"manhood\" with a red button on his desk --will die by the gun.\n\nFolks, no doubt about it, we have a mental health issue -- a fixation on guns, which has nothing to do with the second amendment., 4 In some weird karmic way, it makes sense that the United States has so much carnage through mass shootings because we export death around the globe.\nThe U.S. is just reaping what it sows. The universe has a way of displaying irony., 4 One former Republican lawmaker said recently that if we really wanted to stop these shootings we would not elect Republicans. When are we going to learn that demanding Republican lawmakers do something means nothing because they work for the people who elected them, people who actually vote? When is the news media going to start pointing this out?  The 2nd Amendment folks have a 100% turnout. , 4 The newest GOP caller pushback on local radio is to blame these \"mega campus schools\". If only there were small neighborhood schools they argue, then the causes would be eliminated. No mention of Sandy Hook, a lovely neighborhood school. No mention of guns. And this is in the Boston area. , 4 Sad beyond words. No more wasted praying, action is needed. Just say No, make gun ownership illegal America. Put children before guns. \n\n://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2018/feb/15/ben-jennings-florida-school-shooting-cartoon, 4 Why are decent people not separating from the failled united states and starting new, workable countries? Leave the gun maniacs and trump behind.  Otherwise, this is your endless future on repeat.\n\ncalfreeco.org - Californians certainly deserve better., 4 Kill. Pray. Kill. Pray\nWhen will it ever end  ?\nWhen US legislators get some guts and ban automatic and semi automatic arms from being sold., 4 Universal conscription.\nUniversal firearms training for our well regulated militia.\nWell regulated means a mental health assessment.\nArms secured in the local militia armory.\nClose order drill directed by Cadet Bonespurs.\nForward march., 4 Congratulations to Mr. Barry on writing a thoughtful article on school shootings without repeating the bogus statistics (18 school shootings so far in 2018 !!!) that have become a staple of press coverage., 4 Even when republicans were shot at a baseball game, they canoe out in favor of more guns.\n\nSo, why do you think they care about your child?, 4 I don't even read the reports anymore. They could be out of an automatic article generator. Just like news about 'violence in Gaza' or the 'peace process' in the Middle-East that have been exactly the same for decades. You already know what's in it without reading it, and you know it's a waste of time because the consequences, or lack thereof, will be exactly like the last couple hundred times., 4 It's the ritual, Stupid!\nFor decades America has been flooded with military weapons and we are numb to the fact that the massacre is the trailer; the movie is the pageant that follows.\nPerhaps social science, some branch of psychology, will eventually capture the process by which  society transmits a designation to an unstable individual to spill blood in order for the rest of us to feel expiation, release, and then have our orgy of camera trucks, teddy bears, candles, and ribbons.\nLike some kind of madhouse enactment of the  Crucifixion and Easter to follow.\nThe sickest part of the festival is the appearance of politicians emitting their fake sorrow despite being  owned body and by the gun lobby and other corporate puppet masters. Citizens should rise up and forbid them to show up.  The situation is hopeless and has been since Bush II let the assault rifle ban expire and madman Scalia sentenced the country to constant reruns., 4 You guys know that this just doesn\u2019t happen in Australia, don\u2019t you. Nothing like this, nothing remotely like this, since we changed our gun laws in 1996., 4 I don't understand all this complaining ... You got your tax break ..., 4 Awash in guns, the American epidemic of violence will continue. Forget the NRA and the Constitution, America lacks the good judgement and moral backbone to protect its citizens. Sandy Hook was the litmus test for that and America failed. , 4 Republicans are nothing but a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA. If you want to defeat the NRA vote out the Republicans in the midterms., 4 Is it time to wake up, USA?, 4 Don't ask god to do what you can do yourself.\nEncourage and work  to get like mined people to register and vote. , 4 The land of the free? What a joke!!, 4 Hate to say it, but it\u2019s true. There are two different types of people in America and probably the world. Those who don\u2019t believe humans can learn and evolve and those who do.\nIf the republicans have to cave and support the nra and they won\u2019t support universal health care especially when it comes to mental health, then shootouts are what they\u2019re supporting., 4 There are ENOUGH Americans who are disgusted with the so-called leaders!!\n\nWHY don't Americans flood the streets and start massive non-violent civil disobedience???\n\nMahatma Gandhi did!  ML King did! Nelson Mandela did! Americans did to stop Vietnam war!!!!\n\nStart protest marches in EVERY state in EVERY major city.  Hold protest marches in front of ALL NRA offices - most of all their head office.  Hold protest marches in front of the office of EACH and EVERY politician that votes to rescind gun control!\n\nThere will be pushback from the gun lobby of course!\n\nHowever, there are enough Americans who are TRULY sick and TOTALLY disgusted with spineless and morally corrupt politicians to push the gun lobby back, non-violently!!\n\nHow about that, Americans????, 4 Religious leaders neet to publicly refuse to pray. , 4 This \"prayer\" stuff: could it be any more cynical, coming from these senators, governors and representatives - not to mention the executive branch - who routinely take hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NRA? Is this a joke? \n\nIf these kids - and all the others sacrificed to the holy altar of the NRA dollar - had been killed by another country, the armed forces would be mobilized. We'd be at (another) war, tomorrow. Instead, we have \"prayers.\" \n\nTry praying to get re-elected. Let's see how that goes for you. , 4 Obama had it right. They cling to their guns and religion. Shoot first, pray later. Idiotic, tragic, disgusting, all at once. \n\nIf all these elected officials can offer is prayers, they should go to church and leave Congress for people that can enact useful laws. So far they have enabled the shooting of children in the name of money., 4 The U.S. should round up all individuals like the sicko who murdered the students in FL and form them into a special fighting force and send them to help defeat ISIS which was created as a direct result of the unjustified invasion of our Iraqi province by the bankrupt, lawyer dominated U.S. government., 4 As labor leader Joe Hill supposedly said before being hanged for a murder he didn't commit: Don't mourn, organize., 4 NRA - Not Rational Anymore - needs to be front and center in campaigns opposing those who receive money from it. Beside the amount donated and the photo of the NRA dupe being supported should be included a photo of the carnage that the NRA does in our nation's schools. The NRA is now a corrupt organization and can be prosecuted under the RICO statute. Those corrupt politicians who are supported by the NRA are also corrupt and need to be removed. \"Thoughts and prayers\" no longer cut it. , 4 Some things are illegal because they are so obviously a danger to the public:\nchildren driving cars; unlicensed persons flying airplanes; rail crossings without warning signs;\ncivilians owning RPG's(rocket-propelled grenades), surface-to-air missiles, or fully automatic machine guns.\n\nFurthermore, no one is allowed to direct lasers at aircraft cockpits or shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater.\n\nAll the above are clear dangers to the public, just as assault rifles are a clear danger to the public.\n\nLet the assault rifle ban become the only topic of political discussion until the elections in November; demand that reporters ask questions about no other topic. The only force in politics stronger than NRA bribes is the November ballot, so let voters hold their representatives accountable if they oppose a ban or try to avoid taking a position on the ban.\n\nThis is not rocket science. Any citizen of average intelligence is capable of planning the removal of assault rifles from private ownership, so we can surely expect no less from our politicians., 4 Paralysis in Washington is deadly if a doctor did this they could lose their license to practice.\nExcept for the wealthy Americans have to send their loved ones off with fingers crossed , 4 When will America\u2019s love of guns and shooting stop being more important to politicians than our love for our children and family?, 4 If we can not control people the only other option is to control GUNS!!  There are too many of them in this country.  Over 300 million.  It is not possible to prevent gun violence and commonplace shooting massacres unique to the United States without private citizens relinquishing guns to the police and military..Private citizens in the US possess 50% of the firearms of all the worlds private citizens who own guns..Also it must be illegal for any politician or political organization to accept any contributions from NRA or any other gun lobby or manufacturer, this must stop immediately!!!, 4 These shootings make me think of Greek mythology\u2019s Minotaur and how they had to sacrifice young men and women every few years to feed it.  Good luck to those who enter the maze of gun control to take on the NRA at its centre., 4 The NRA contributes more to these school shootings than any other institution in the country.  One might say they are directly responsible as their continual financial support of our politicians prevents legislation that might stop them.  Politicians who accept NRA money (I\u2019m looking at you Bernie Sanders) deserve neither our respect or our votes.  It is time to get tough with spineless legislators who refuse to even make an attempt to solve this problem., 4 The republicans will shed some crocodile tears by pretending to be praying for the gun violence victims (and saying \"it's no time for discussing gun control\") at the same time keep in taking millions of $ donation from America's most extremist organization supporting gun lobby, NRA to protect and promote the interest of gun manufacturers and trigger happy rednecks.\nNRA donated about $21 million to Trump, many more millions to house speaker Paul Ryan, other Republican congressmen like Marco Rubio. It's more astonishing that all these politicians claim to be believer of Jesus Christ and devout Christian.\nThese republicans talk about compromise only when they personally face gun violence. But they also quickly go back to businesses of politics and lure of power make them forget the reality soon., 4 \u201cWe are children,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys are the adults. Work together, come over your politics, and get something done.\u201d  Remember the words of this young man, Americans!  The influence the NRA has on Congress needs to be defeated, 4 I sent my kindergartner off to school today -- as I have ever since she started preschool, Sandy Hook and all the others heavy on my mind -- desperately hoping she will come back to me unharmed at day's end. This is life in America. , 4 Is it 3 days before the Republicans say \"this isn't the time to talk/do something about gun control\" or is it 4?  I can't remember., 4 In an accompanying article a mother asks if her child died for nothing.\n\nYes, she did. All of the children who have died in school shootings have died without reason or purpose, because Congress does nothing in response.\n\nThe country accepts and tolerates these slaughters so that grown men can play with their toys and delusional paranoids can pretend they are defending freedom.  We make that trade off with every vote for a person who is against gun safety legislation. , 4 The worst thing about the latest school shooting is that I\u2019m thinking thoughts like \u201cI wonder how the combined weight of all gunshot victims of 2017 compares to the total weight of venison that hunters took down from the same year?\u201d\nWe protect gun rights for reasons like hunting which is obviously way more important than young children being blown away every couple weeks. The reactions to these mass murder spree killings are perverse. Invoking your religion is passing the buck. The government doesn\u2019t care about your children and neither does anyone with an NRA sticker. Everyone who says anything else has very little argument beyond their translation of the constitution and a bible.\nAnother school shooting? Yawn. Wake me up when everyone on tv and in the government isn\u2019t reciting the same empty smokescreen and maybe I\u2019ll be engaged. In the meantime raise a glass to the future memory of the next 500 victims of the AR-15, 4 We can lay blame on guns but we had gun rights before Columbine, Sandy Hooks and all the others.  \n\nThere is another problem in this country that may well transcend gun rights.  It is not Republicans and not Democrats; it is not whites and not non-whites; it is not the uneducated and not the educated; it is not the poor and not the rich.\n\nIf we confiscate guns do we also confiscate explosives?  Do we confiscate pressure cookers and nails?  Do we confiscate bottles and gasoline?  Do we confiscate matches and lighters?  Do we confiscate kitchen knives and pocket knives!\n\nWe might say the answer is that we confiscate hatred, racism, sexism, discrimination, nationalism, insensitivity, bad parenting, bad teachers, and all other things bad.  \n\nGentle readers, if you have the solution, pray share it with me.  I feel totally hopeless., 4 Virtually every facility that serves the mentally ill,  persons who have had brain injuries accompanied by behavioral issues, persons with some stage of dementia, whether a small group home or a large institution, have something called a \u2018sharps drawer\u2019. Cutlery is kept locked up in the sharps drawer for obvious reasons in those environments. When gun owners have the misfortune of the onset of dementia, families, often assisted by law enforcement, remove guns from the premises or make sure that they are secured. This isn\u2019t rocket science; when people lose their cool, whether that\u2019s due to mental problems or a temporary state of rage, having weapons handy often leads to horrific outcomes. Doing harm with knives or clubs require hand-to-hand combat, very strenuous and difficult to kill on any scale beyond a single victim. A semiautomatic gun kills rapidly from a distance, with little more physical effort than pulling a trigger with a finger., 4 It would be great if the NYT would publish an article on who, what and where in our political system is paid by the NRA and other gun right advocacy groups. Or maybe there is a website you could link too. It might be very informative to see just who is being bought by these organizations.  , 4 Do not go gentle into the night\nRage, Rage against the dying of the light , 4 The essential fact that Republicans refuse to face is that we are a violent nation, more violent than almost any other on earth, and many of our citizens should not have access to advanced weapons.\n\nThe American Revolution. Native genocide. A civil war that killed almost 1 million Americans. Inventors of nuclear weapons and, to date, the only country to use them. Constantly invading countries that pose no real threat to us. Perpetual wars that no one seems even interested in halting. Even our leisure is spent with violence: movies about revenge, humorous horror movies where people are killed over and over. Our most popular sport is 300 pound guys throwing each other to the ground. We even figured out how to kill people from toy planes.\n\nWe are a violent culture. And some citizens obviously have trouble keeping that violence in a nice, neat box. So, what is the Republican response? When they have one at all, it's usually, you guessed it, kill the killer. \n\nWe need to face up to the fact that something in the American character is damaged. We believe violence is the answer to problems. And because of that, we need to actually start telling people no, you cannot have that weapon. There is no other solution., 4 \u201cThoughts and prayers\u201d.   After you\u2019ve heard it a million times, such a meaningless platitude.  You aren\u2019t really praying do anyone. You are just saying it either because your communications person told you to or because you think it makes you look good. It make you want to punch these people in the face every time you hear it, particularly these spineless legislators. , 4 Judge a country by how it treats its most vulnerable--its kids.\nWhat a sick country this is that I have to worry about my child going to school. That I have to think of my \"escape routes\" on the college campus where I teach.\nLet's use our votes to challenge this grip the NRA has on politicians. That's the only way out. , 4 Let us all pray until the next tragedy happens then more prayers and thoughts, more people get killed and the cycle repeats, keep guns and worship the Second Amendment, that came from gods, we, human beings are helpless, blame mental illness if the next tragedy happens. Keep doing prayers, at some point god will intervene, gun violence is a unique illness only Americans suffer, only god can help., 4 The NRA owns this and so does every Senator and Repreenative who is soaked in NRA blood money.  And I mean soaked, to the tune of millions of dollars in some cases.  Find out if your legislator accepted NRA money and if so, call him or her up and tell them you are voting for their opponent in the next election.  Then do it., 4 Don't call them \"leaders.\" They are cowards. , 4 The enemy is us., 4 A conservative Republican woman running for Congress here in Texas aired a TV ad not three hours after the Florida massacre showing her expertise with a rifle and her support for the Second Amendment. I know this is Texas, but she should be deeply ashamed on several counts. Pandering to your base and genuflecting to the NRA is not something to be done over the murdered bodies of children., 4 The responsibility for the murders is squarely on the shooter.  The responsibility for the shooter gaining legal access to an AR-15 assault rifle is squarely on every single American!!  This is not an NRA issue, 2nd amendment issue, a political party issue, gun lobby issue, or even a presidential issue; this is an issue for every one of us gun owners in the US.  Yes, gun ownership is a right and driving a car is a privilege but we have to do the right thing as a people and treat our guns the same way we treat our cars.  Gun owners to guns is equivalent to car owners to cars with the equivalent level of scrutiny placed on both.  This is the right and moral thing to do!!!!!!, 4 What's your solution?\n\nYou want everyone turn in their AR-15 because some mentally ill criminal used theirs to murder people??  \n\nThere is not going to be a ban like Australia.\n\nWhat we need is better security at schools and a focus on identifying people who would do such things., 4 So the President wants to go to Parkland this weekend? Why? To toss tissue boxes to the grieving  families? , 4 There are millions of Americans with similar emotional problems as Cruz, perhaps even mental illness.  A small minority, with extremely easy access to military style weapons, turn into shooters like Cruz. How does one account for all the other mass killing shooters? The only thing they have in common is extremely easy access to military style weapons.  These are the real terrorists in America.\nUntil Congress is no longer controlled by the NRA, this unabated carnage with guns will continue.\nIt's just the cost of living here, folks., 4 A Tweet, Mr. President? Your first response is a Tweet??, 4 At a minimum everyone posting these comments here needs to write to their reps in Washington and also pen a letter to their local paper so that others beside NYTimes readers hear your views. And vote in November against those who do nothing about this situation!, 4 And our Speker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, who has taken at least $170,000 from the NRA, says it\u2019s too early to do anything.\n\nNo, Mr. Ryan, now is the time.  Redeem yourself!  Do something.  \n\nHow would Ryan like it if it was his kids he was planning funerals for? \n\nAutomatic rifles have no place in the hands of public citizens.  , 4 I gave up after Sandy Hook. It looks hopeless. It is very easy to pray for someone else\u2019s loss and do nothing about it. Hope no one has to go through this trauma but I am sure we will have another one soon because how can we not let the NRA lovers have their semi automatics and automatics. Their rights are more sacred than the lives of our kids, 4 the ONLY possible answer to the chronic inaction and cowardice of our politicians to do anything about gun control laws is a nationwide economic boycott. Clearly, money is the only thing that matters to politicians. A nationwide boycott of malls, restaurants, and movie theaters, would change the laws quickly in this country., 4 There will be no single answer to this problem. But something must be done. We must begin and stop turning our heads. We are all cringing now, waiting for the next one. When will it be my child, when will it be my community? \n\nAllowing anyone to buy and carry around an AR-15 is one place to start. For goodness sake, why is this even debatable? These weapons are being used to kill our beautiful children! You folks that want to maintain the status quo are heartless monsters., 4 I don't believe, whatever he says, that our president actually prays, ever, for any reason. He is the supreme leader, after all. Who could he possibly pray to? His comments add insult to injury, hypocrisy to horror., 4 The NRA is the most organized and disciplined lobbying organization in the country. Until gun control advocates, such as myself, register and act upon that fact - and match that commitment with money, lots and lots of money - the slaughter will continue.\n\nWe cannot expect change absent discipline in our opposition.\n\nWe are AMERICANS, not savages. We must do this., 4 When I was about to write this I thought how terrible can I be? What I was going to write was that I had a good belly laught when this news came out! Another school killing - well they are Americans.\n\nThen I thought, what country in the world could be so corrupt that it endorses the killing of childeren in school. And again I thought America and the Philippines.\n\nThen I thought, do the senators in the Philippines get paid by a lobby group that acts for gun sellers. The answer was no.\n\nThen I realized, senators in America like to see children killed: perhaps they get a stiffy when they think of dismembered children and the money they get paid.\n\nThen I told myself, never again will I buy anythin made in America. My whole village agrees., 4 Repeat repeat repeat.  Let's see, it's Friday, the outrage might last through the weekend, then we'll forget about it. Paul Ryan will continue to say his thoughts and prayers, Marco will continue to take NRA blood money, and all of America will continue to turn on their TVs and see the same scene, over and over.  Where was Trump's outrage yesterday?  He gave a mealy-mouthed soft-voiced reading of thoughts and prayers.  Then takes away money for mental health.  To give to the 1% and military.\n\nWhen will the madness end?  At some point, everyone will know someone who has been affected with gun violence, just like everyone knows someone with cancer.  This IS a cancer, and a pox on our nation., 4 Most Congressional Republicans (corrupted by the NRA) say the problem is not guns but mental illness. If so, why - just a year ago - did they (and the \u201cpresident) make it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns? \n\nAnd why is there not an infusion of funding for mental health treatment. They don\u2019t care at all about our children. , 4 Don't forget the Supreme Court's role in all this. We don't have to repeal the Second Amendment to return to sensible regulation of guns -- we need a Supreme Court that doesn't interpret the Second Amendment in the most radical way possible: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/10/th...., 4 Frankly, until someone connected to the government or a major corporation experiences an  event that involves their loved ones or themselves  being gunned down nothing will be done.Massacres of this sort only involves the common folk,not the masters of the universe. Until then our fears will be used against us just to make more money., 4 I miss a lot about living in the US. \n\nBeing worried that my son might get shot at school when he goes is not one of them. , 4 Money talks, and the money the NRA uses and contributes to those politicians that keeps the voters electing them, repeatedly and without question as to whether the policies are really serve the public interest, keep the cycle going. We get exactly the government we deserve. Can't be bothered to vote? Can't be bothered to go beyond the slick ads and manipulated social media to really think about who and what you are voting for? You should not be surprised when your children or grandchildren die in mass shootings. You should not be confused as to how this happens and continues to happen. The electorate has enabled this. By majority vote we have decided this is the kind of society in which we want to live. This is not the only case where the private profits outweigh the social costs. We have created a culture that revels in the many ways to profit off the misery and death of citizens of this country. You think you're safe until, one day, you find you are not., 4 Thoughts and prayers are not helping. Telling us it is not the time to \"Politicize this tragedy\" is just kicking the can to the next tragedy and the next and the next. The inactivity of policy making is disgusting. \n\nHow many have to do before lives are more important than guns? What is the acceptable number? When is the acceptable time to talk about common sense gun laws? \n\nSince Columbine in 1999, there have been 25 fatal, active school shooting incidents at elementary and high schools in America. And yet the GOP lawmakers and the NRA are telling us that gun control is not the issue. \n\nSix of the ten deadliest mass shootings in the U.S. over the past decade have used an AR-15-style rifle. \n\nThere needs to be a discussion and it needs to happen now, not after the next deadly mass shooting, but NOW. It's not a partisan issue, all are affected: democrat, republican, independent, Jewish, Catholic, black, white, hispanic., 4 As a devout Catholic, my heart and soul hurts when I see stories like this. Yes I always offer prayers and support to those affected by this horrific tragedies of unspeakable proportions. What disgusts me more is the leadership of our country on gun control and mental health where little to no action has been done. I don\u2019t know how much more we can bear of these stories, but I would implore if not demand that Trump and the current administration along with every politician to get their act together and please make a viable solution where more unity and love is embedded with less hatred and violence in our world! Honestly, the current leader and his administration have failed at delivering a safer America let alone added more divided than unity to our great country. While my heart and mind thinks of every victim affected by gun violence (let alone the ones who caused it), we must be both diligent and consistent in having our voices heard! #enoughisenough, 4 Fix background checks.  Secure the schools. Make selling a weapon to a person with mental illness, underage or with a history of violence a crime.  I've read that a majority of people agree to these issues.\n\nPresident Roosevelt advised his Cabinet about the Great Depression, \"Try SOMETHING.  And if it doesn't work, TRY SOMETHING ELSE.\n\nSaying what won't work is not the same as \"We tried it and it didn't work.\"  Let's do what we all can agree to and see what happens.  , 4 Military assault rifles have NO place in society. They are meant to do one thing, and as we have seen, they do it very well.  Perhaps if the gun manufacturers and the NRA were required to send reparations to the grieving families, we could hit them where it really hurts.  I would hate to think the blood is on my hands., 4 I share the author's frustration but to say nothing is ever done is totally inaccurate. After every single mass shooting in modern American history, gun laws are LOOSENED further, and millions of $$ are collected by politicians doing the gun manufacturers bidding. People ask \"why\" there is no interest in preventing mass shootings and, like in most things in American life, you need only follow the money. Dead kids = large campaign contributions., 4 There is no way other than controlling access to weapons of mass murder to still this nonsense.  Platitudes about mental health are disingenuous especially since this Congress and this president passed and signed legislation that made it easier for mentally disturbed persons to acquire firearms.  Listen folks, even after Congressional members were gunned down they did nothing, so what are a few children being killed every week or so? It is a national disgrace and shame, but we really do not care because we allow our elected officials to take his of money from the NRA, and still do not hold them, or the officials accountable., 4 Hey here's an idea.  How about every single decent patriot make school safety (and by extension gun control ) the litmus test for every single candidate running for public office ?  Elections right around the corner.  Don't let a crisis go to waste., 4 Another school shooting. Watching news casts of the event and subsequent public pronouncements is now so predictable that it is like watching a re-run.\nIn the book \"12 Rules of Life\", recently referenced in  David Brooks column, Jordan Peterson in chapter 5 and right on point in Chaper 6, focuses on the root cause of these horrific losses. Nihilism, one will rear, is deep rooted now in our culture. The past was not immune to this denial of Being, existence, human existence, is meaningless. Whatever you think of Peterson and there are plenty of critics, I fear he is on to something. But that said, unregulated guns and there profligation have exponentially made these acts of destruction more horrific because of the shear numbers killed. The moral root cause cannot probably be addressed short term, albeit moral leadership by example and actions from all and especially from our \"leaders\" would go a long way. And simply focusing on mental health, while necessary, is not sufficient. What can be addressed is good regulation of firearms whose real purpose is mass and efficient killing. Time to get on with it or we can just wait for the next re-run. , 4 As a former teacher, I could not be more heartsick for the children and parents involved in this deadly event.  I have nothing but rage and contempt for the gutless and contemptible lawmakers who continue to turn a blind eye to ANY possible solution to the ongoing killing.\nAs one columnist said yesterday, after Sandy Hook,  the killing  of children became an acceptable part of the right to own firearms, and the gun debate was essentially over.\nUnless the AMERICAN PEOPLE rise up and demand change, it will not occur.  Quit asking lawmakers  --  DEMAND it,  and by all means, with your power at the voting booth.   , 4 I feel safer living in France than I do in the U.S. Yes, even with France\u2019s terrorism problem, I feel way safer here. I felt it that moment I came to live here. A weight was lifted. , 4 What law would have stopped this from happening. Yes a troubled 19 year old. But no criminal history and the legal right to buy guns. Was the Facebook post enough to charge him with attempt, prevent him from owning a gun. Exactly what would have prevents this?, 4 Many of the young people who experienced this awful tragedy will be voters in 2020.  Voting is about the only solution we have as citizens because our representatives are stuck in mud, and we have a president who just doesn't get it.   These students are old enough to  remember vividly what will come out of this horrid situation.  As we are seeing, many of them are afraid or too shy to speak out about their experiences.  They will become activists and leaders.  They are our hope for a better future.  They are our hope for voting and helping to get rid of the mess we have now in government.  , 4 The media glorification of these tragedies is enhanced by constant displays of the students with their hands up over their heads, Attica prison inmate style, walking/running away from the shooting.  This is empowering symbolism feeds the terrorists and enhances their media status.  Just walking and running is more than enough!\nCorporate money should never have been given the label and right of \"free speech\" without the accompanying responsibilities.  Corporations, NRA, do not have a right to free speech unless they can also suffer death in either: war, at the hands of the state or the will of the people.  Shame on the do nothing Congress., 4 Once we have cultivated angry young men like Nikolas Cruz, the background checks, security measures at schools, improved identification of \u201cmentally ill\u201d people or gun regulations will remain necessary but woefully insufficient.   It is like a frantic scramble to treat small pox without ever looking at the cause.   All of our responses to the slaughter of children are epitaphs on a closed barn door.   \n\nBoys like Nikolas Cruz were not born evil or mentally ill.    Seething anger that erupts in a spasm of blood is not a genetic or theological condition.  It is often a product of neglect and abuse, bullying and humiliation.   Every backstory of a man bent on extreme violence is a story of a boy bent by the indifference or cruelty of a milieu lacking love and compassion.   It may happen at home or it may happen in a school where some boys are isolated in plain sight or taunted with no one paying attention.  The one nearly universal factor is that these boys are desperately lonely.  In a few cases, like the two often-bullied boys who riddled Columbine with bullets, they bond with another and the rage is compounded., 4 Maybe the Broward County Sheriff should run for Governor of Florida and overhaul the most insane pro-gun legislation in the US. Thanks to JEBush and Rick Scott (Mr. 5th Amendment 75-times). What states cab do may be limited, but its a start - more then we get from Washington. , 4 The old adage:  FOLLOW THE MONEY.    Our spineless Congress is owned and controlled by the NRA (and others), so Congress does what it is told to do.  Saving children's lives is not one of those things they are told to do..............., 4 Mail campaign donation checks with \"Thoughts and Prayers\" as the amount, given that Congress members consider them so valuable as to give them to the parents of dead children., 4 It's really quite amazing how much control the NRA has in this country.  I would like to know where there money and power really come from., 4 With no disrespect towards the faithful, I believe that prayers should not be an excuse for doing nothing.\nIt used to be said that God helps those who help themselves , 4 America has to vote for Politicians who will act on this issue, it's that simple. The current GOP government will not, period. NRA funding corrupt politicians is truly sickening and makes a mockery of America's so called democracy. America has the best politicians money can buy on this issue, get rid of them., 4 \"And men still keep on marching off to war.\nElectrically they keep a baseball score.\nAnd the beat goes on, the beat goes on.\"\nNothing has changed since Viet Nam and nothing has changed since Sandy Hook.  So Sad!, 4 I believe that psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and therapists should loudly protest the scapegoating of the mentally ill., 4 Anyone who thinks that this meets the definition of a well-regulated militia is as delusional as the shooters. , 4 Easy to blame Republicans. We know they\u2019ll do nothing to change gun laws, but what of the folk who continue to vote them in? You\u2019ve gotten what you paid for, so stop with the hand-wringing and forlorn surprise., 4 President Trump tweeted \u201cNo child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d\n\nHowever, Page 719 of President Trump\u2019s FY 2019 budget, released three days ago, provides a 16% cut to grant programs to help states do gun background checks.\n\nAnd as the President told guns rights advocates gathered in Atlanta less than a year ago in late April 2017: \u201cThe eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. [You] have a true friend and champion in the White House. I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Never ever.\u201d\n\nHow will these cuts and these statements make children, teachers or anyone else feel safer in American schools, Mr. President?, 4 My goodness me.  Politicians begging the big daddy in the sky to fix things when they dont have the guts to fix them themselves., 4 What a hysterical country we have become.  We always forget.  We are in the same loop, again.  Wash, rinse, repeat.\nWe must wake up.  We must stop dancing around the edges.  We need real persistent rage.  We need to identify our enemies and not forget.  John McCain gets more funds from the NRA then anyone, yet he gets hero\u2019s treatment.  We don\u2019t dare blame him for his part in the murder of so many children.  We will talk about background checks today, but Marco Rubio wins votes and money because he made up excuses so we don\u2019t notice the gun.  Trump takes NRA money.  The press discusses the finer points of terrorism and racism. We take solace that the killer is white and not \u201cother\u201d. It proves our point.\nBUT WE NEVER JUST GET RID OF GUNS!  And that is what we need to do.    , 4 There are federal restrictions to hand gun ownership, minimal as they may be. There is apparently no restriction to who may own a long gun. So while the 15 yo down the street may not be able to drive a car, he can legally own an assault rifle with no training or license. All the teddy bears and candle light vigils in the world won't save us, if we aren't ready to make even the smallest consessions to common sense and public safety. I own guns. Most people here own guns. I don't know anybody that thinks everybody under all circumstances should own any gun they want. It's hard to tell kids they shouldn't use drugs, have premarital sex and drink and drive, but weapons of war are ok and not look like blind hypocrites and cowards. , 4 It is sad that people seem to  prefer to turn to an imaginary skydaddy instead of acting like responsible adults and creating some common sense gun laws., 4 How can a country where this regularly happens call itself ' First World'. In 'Third World' countries like India, China or for that matter ANY country in the World, children don't shoot other children in Schools.\nSyria, Iran, Iraq and even N. Korea are much better than this 'Shame' of the country on earth, at least there you know who your enemies are, and kids don't go around shooting in schools. \n\nAnd the NRA and GOA response is to arm Principal and Teachers as well, so that one day they can also start shooting at unsuspecting kids when (take your pick)\n1. they are not able to cope with their class\n2. they are depressed in their life\n3. they have a grudge against another teacher/principle/staff/janitor/student\n\nI am ashamed today that I stayed in the US for 7 years, it is a blot in my life which can't be erased. This is why I chose to raise my children across the ocean. Americans, you have a choice too (or may be not) !\n\nSigh !!, 4 \"Thoughs and prayers\" - The definition of \"it's the least we can do\"\nWe can, and must do more., 4 America needs to take a good long hard look at itself.  From the outside world we are a horror no better than those places most of you would never consider visiting.  What is the difference between random bombings killing innocents in far away countries and the risk of your innocent children being massacred?\nAs an American living abroad, my life is at risk to terrorism every day in foreign cities, but that risk is so small that is it far from my mind most of the time.\nSo I ask my fellow countrymen at home, how can you live knowing that your own children might be slaughtered in cold blood on your doorstep, in the street, in their High School, or even in their kindergarden?\nAmerica is sick, time to seek help., 4 THE AMERICAN GENOCIDE\nwe live in a country where people have adapted to the mass slaughter of children as an acceptable price for unfettered gun ownership.\nnowhere else in the world can one find this peculiar adaptation.\u00a0\nIs this part of the cost of Empire, the cost of make America great again?\u00a0\nWould you rather have Empire and greatness, or would you rather bring these angels back to Earth?\nDoes not each one of these furious fusillades from some tormented soul diminish us as a nation if we do little else but offer our thoughts and prayers? and some trinkets for the burials?\nIf i lost one of my sons, my life would be over . . . . it's no different for these parents, right? they are shells of the people they were yesterday. Your children are your breath, your heart, your pulse.\u00a0\nWe didn't lose 17 people to madness and gun violence yesterday, we lost hundreds. \u00a0\nSTOP and Grieve.\u00a0\nSouls in tremendous pain, consumed by mental illness can, with enough anger and ammunition, turn that pain outward. They are not committing suicide, they are committing a unique form of American genocide. Genocide of the innocents.\nOur politicians, Democrats, republicans, libertarians, greens, all of them, lack the courage necessary for leadership.  Business as usual is the true insanity., 4 I was sickened today after reading Trump's comments on this latest heartbreaking school shooting by a teenager with an assault weapon.  As the article says, Trump didn't even mention guns in his little \"speech\" about how he cares so much about children.  To blame what happened on a troubled kid, or on people who knew the kid had problems, is misleading and wrong.  What were they supposed to do?  Stop him from buying a gun?  How, when he can do so legally?  As we all know, Trump is likely to make sure to the best of his ability that that continues to be the case.  I am a parent and I am furious.  Why aren't more people furious like I am?  Hey, Elon Musk!  Instead of sending cars up in space how about donating a bunch of money to pay for research into making guns safer, smarter, and less likely to fall into the hands of the wrong people?  Zuckerberg?  Bezos?   Why don't I hear the powerful and influential voices of sanity - not to mention real compassion, instead of Trump's fake version of it - that should be speaking up right now?  Crickets., 4 Since Columbine, the talking heads in congress, state or federal have done nothing. They bend over backwards for the NRA and worry about whether they will be re-elected, but do nothing for children in school or anyone  else a mass shootings has destroyed.  They say the same things each time and we know they do not mean it.  When is enough enough!  , 4 I will go to my classrooms today wondering what might happen. My college has trained me in responding to an active shooter. So, I'll look for the lock on the door and the blind on its window. I'll consider possible escape routes. I will know how to reach Security to tell them what they will likely already know. I'll face my students, and they'll be looking at me. While nothing is spoken, we'll all be thinking that it probably won't happen here. But we'll wonder., 4 The Essence of Gun Control\n\nAnd a nation sends thoughts and prayers., 4 So sad to see and hear of this further tragedy, incomprehensible to people here in the UK where one such killing (Dunblane 1996) brought stricter gun control straightaway. Nothing like it has happened again. , 4 Starting tomorrow \u2013 and every day thereafter - the NYT should print a front page tally of the year-to-date school shooting (or all mass shooting) body count.  \n\nAnd it would be helpful to publish the Member by Member vote count on significant legislation over the past few years so parents and students \u2013 and not just the NRA \u2013 know who has their back.   Interview Members of Congress now about their inaction, and then interview them again following future tragedies.   Force them to decide between supporting the NRA or American parents., 4 For four years now I do not stress that someone will walk into my daughters school and shoot her, I dont worry that she will be shot in the street, I used to, in our old cities, everyday. Not for four years.Since we moved to our new country, America has had thousands of people shot by mass shootings and gun violence, even by the police, over 1000 killed last year. My stepbrother was shot, friends have been shot, my schoolmates father shot her then himself. I talk to expats here and we all have the same stories. Prayers, psychiatric meds, incarceration....Ive no idea what will fix Americas problem with itself. There is no country to blame for this, except America.This , and this alone, keeps me safe in Russia. Yes, Russia. All my students today were shocked, a few crying, why, why,why....why, America? , 4 These horrible tragedies sadly only reinforce the fact that only term limits on politicians and gun control will save this county., 4 I don\u2019t know that we should really blame members of Congress when voters keep electing them. A fellow Tennessean said to me, while talking about a recent mass shooting (can\u2019t even remember which): \u201cYeah, it\u2019s horrible.... We need more guns.\u201d\n\nNo irony or sarcasm\u2014that was his earnest response/solution. This is the root problem, Congress simply reflects it., 4 Yes! Yes! Yes!\nIt has been reduced to a script just like the author described. The pictures of the event and the \u201ccandlelight vigils\u201d after are all the same. The bickering after on Facebook and other sites is the same. It\u2019s like an endless repeat of the chocolate factory episode of \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d We all know what happens. Only it isn\u2019t funny. , 4 This is all so odd watching from Australia, where we have been gun massacre free for 22 years and counting.\n\nYes, 22 years.\n\nNo, we don't live in a utopian magical world with unicorns and stardust and no crime and no mental illness (though we do have lovely beaches). We just have less guns, and they're much harder to get. It's not rocket science.\n\nI don't know what is wrong with you (6.5 billion + of the world's population doesn't know), but I think it has a lot to do with American's preoccupation for screaming 'me, me, me' at every opportunity. Maybe when you start thinking 'we, we, we' you might see some change.\n\nNot holding my breath. , 4 There are no words sufficient to describe this uniquely American horror, but let's face it, we are a violent society that worships almost everything violent, from TV to the movies, and one that brings, via its military, death and violence to other nations and societies.  We think there will never be blowback, but there is. Allowing more and more people to have guns and ammunition, including the mentally ill, is a huge mistake. The problem isn't just Cruz or the NRA, but us and our useless, bought and sold politicians who are more worried about getting votes than keeping Americans from killing each other.  Turn on your local news, this is a daily occurrence all over the country, a scourge. No prayers can or will help, only action, swift action. , 4 You left out the part where people go out and purchase even more guns and ammunition. , 4 Thoughts and prayers are about as useful as an obstetrician in a monastery. , 4 This title captures it well., 4 Does anyone know how this strange national phenomenon looks from abroad? I\u2019m not talking about how other countries see the U.S. I\u2019m talking about how the U.S. looks to U.S. citizens from a distance. \n\nPowerless and foolish. That\u2019s what. \n\nPrayer vigils? \n\nReally? , 4 Prayers may help those who survived, but will not change the conditions and rules that allowed this to happen - again and again.   Trump, McConnell, Ryan, Congress, state legislatures, local leaders - no more empty-handed prayers from you.  Do something!   No more excuses.  No more guns!, 4 Trump's tweet: So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\n\nWe've been reporting you, Donald, again and again.  What is going to be done?, 4 Our country is very sick.  Our so-called leaders should be put on trial for wanton disregard of their constituencies.  They swore an oath to defend and protect yet offer only platitudes through stained teeth before taking their weekly NRA check and FOX talking point checklist.\n\nIf we cannot muster the strength to vote out this entire government then we have two choices: revolution or dissolution.  We've done it before - about 250 years ago - and we can do it again.  NO LONGER can we idly sit by while men with no character, no morals, and no compassion drive what was the best of our country into the dirt for a few more dollars in their grubby little fingers.  We can start the revolution by voting all of these losers out of office and by creating a new constitution that wipes the 2nd amendment from the map.\n\nOlder married couples often renew their vows in a beautiful ceremony that reflects their past and their new future ahead - when will we do the same as a country?  And recognize that what we were 250 years ago is not who we are now but, in fact, we can be better and recommit to our ideals., 4 We used to ban gun sales to mentally ill people.  Then, the Trump administration and the Trump Congress removed that ban.  We don't know whether the shooter was or would have been reported as mentally ill.  Perhaps an enhanced background inquiry -- more than the current instant computer name check --  would have prevented the shooting.  Guns are as easily available, one way or another,  as candy.  And kids are getting them and acting out the violence in their minds.   , 4 Let's not burn out our energy by attending vigils and saying prayers. Let's match to D.C. and demand tight gun control and confiscation laws. Why do we still accuse other countries of human rights violation? We don't even have the basic human rights here.How much does it take to raise up a child? Only a parent knows. If our government cannot protect our children, then they might as well kill those children's parents. There is no more meaning in life when a parent suddenly lost a beloved child. , 4 If nothing was done after Sandy Hook, nothing is going to be done.  I can only look on in utter amazement and pity., 4 Vote the NRA out of office. Tell every representative who takes a penny from them that they have blood on their hands. Their time is up. Stop complaining on social media. Write to your representatives and tell them their days in \"public service\" are done if they don't get guns off our streets and out of our schools., 4 Is there no national figure who can start a national organization and campaign to confront the intransigence of the NRA and politicians on the issue of guns? There are lots of us who will contribute and join. The legislators and politicians who do not pass laws to remove guns from the hands of the mentally disturbed and ill, who do not ban assault weapons, who promote arm and carry legislation, need to be identified for who they are: they are the REAL CHILDREN KILLERS of the nation!, 4 I\u2019m not sure what lawmakers expect prayers to do when there is another mass murder. Are they saying \u2018we are with you, and we care\u2019. Really? A lot late and a token gesture for the lives of children? Is it working?, 4 Politicians who have accepted NRA's donations are also responsible for each an every school shooting that takes places.   They should be arrested too. , 4 43 years ago a newly made European friend of mine summed up his distaste for the American culture and society. It is why he had absolutely no desire to trade his future for a life in the U.S. He simply said: The trouble with the Americans is that they never solve their problems,...... they simply move on.\" , 4 Gov. Rick Scott's and Senator Marco Rubio's and President Donald Trump's \"thoughts and prayers\" are part of the very \"evil\" that Gov. Rick Scott said is at the heart of school shootings, so stated in his first press briefing after the Florida school shooting. No. It is not an amorphous \"evil\" - \"Devil made him do it' kind of evil. These politicians' words of \"condolence\" are the evil in that they serve as a protective shield for the NRA and its evil policies to keep America awash in weapons of mass destruction, guns that have no place in civilian society such as the AR-15 used in the latest school shooting. Their \"prayers\" obscure the fact that Trump signed a law one year ago, among the very first pieces of legislation from the new Republican majority government, to make it easier for mentally ill people to buy guns; and to this day the White House will not release a photo of the bill signing, even as Trump says we must do something about mentally ill people getting guns. As for Florida, Rick Scott has seen to it that it is one of the states in which the AR-15 assault weapon can be most easily obtained by anyone over 18 years old. You want to talk about evil? Talk to the progenitors of these massacres, the public officials afraid to cross the NRA and unable to protect the people they serve., 4 The population of the U.S. is about 325,000,000. The NRA membership isn\u2019t 3,000,000. We outnumber them, why do they have so much power? If it\u2019s money, let each non member send a dollar to an anti gun organization and use it to buy our own politicians to replace the useless ones we have. There isn\u2019t another  nation where this takes place.\n     A major politician in Florida is running an ad, using an anecdotal example of one person shot by an illegal. What is he doing about our being overrun by assault weapons? Nothing., 4 Mass murder gets a free pass. Congress gets a free pass. Trump can't be bothered with news that isn't doesn't scratch his narcissistic itch.  Mnuchin, a publicity hound second only to his master, thinks Congress shouldn't waste its time with gun laws, as if.\n\nWe have a legal system that allows us to sue in civil court, establish liability for injury, mayhem, death, and seek compensation commensurate with the proven guilt of businesses that profit from products with intentional and hidden risks.  \n\nVictims have sued asbestos, tobacco, pharmaceutical, chemical, toy makers, even auto companies like Ford, which knowingly placed gas tanks in the Pinto where there was high risk of explosions if rear-ended. Ford cynically calculated the potential liability cost for projected fatalities and decided it was more cost-effective to pay millions in wrongful death than redesign the Pinto. Consumer lawsuits effectively cost asbestos and tobacco companies their American market, saving millions of lives in the process.\n\nIf we could sue gun manufacturers there's no doubt that it wouldn't have been business as usual after Sandy Hook.  \n\nBut we can't sue gun manufacturers.  Thanks to Sen Bernie Sanders, gun makers are exempt from consumer liability.  He saves his apoplexy for Wall Street, corporate political influence, financial pirates, but not gun makers.\n\nIf he had been elected president, what solace would he offer the parents of Stoneman Douglas High School as they bury their children?, 4 So what are all those Republican members and Congress and all those NRA supporters waiting for? For something like this to happen in their kids' school? How long is this going to continue before someone in the US realises the madness? Don't call this a \"politically sensitive issue\" any longer, please! Call it what it is, an incredible stain on the honor of lawmakers that stood by and did nothing while children (and adults, and concertgoers and church attendees) were killed..., 4 What we need to do is start reminding people (every time this happens) of the words of the Paul Ryans and Grasslys  who sponsor  legislative obstructions to undermine any semblance of reasonable gun restrictions\n\nOver the next few days we will hear endless republicans talk about mental health.\n\nIn response,   we need (and this generation is quite capable of doing so) endless  tweets and you tube videos exposing those who sponsored (Grassly) and voted for (Republicans) laws to make it easier for the mentally ill to obtain assault weapons\n\nWe  need to create a social media campaign of instagrams, tweets/youtube clips of all the times Republicans said it was not the time to talk about guns after a tragedy \n\nWe will not change the Republicans minds' who are bought and paid for by the NRA;  if dead first graders didn't, nothing will\n\nBut we can change the minds of enough parents and millenials who may vote for these  cold-hearted charlatans out of habit \n\nWe must remind  them what congressional inaction leads to............ young promising people (who look like their siblings, kids and grandkids) cut down before having a chance to live and blossom\n\nThis is the only way we can get responsible legislation.....we need to change the congress, 4 IF NOT NOW, WHEN? The people we have mistakenly placed in office seem oblivious to reality. Their mouths move, meaningless words come out, and nothing gets done. Repeat.\nTheir behavior, in this instance, is bought by the NRA and gun lobby; their leader, the Dotard-in-Chief, has no understanding of real life and death, and endorse and encourages their behavior. His despicable speech, totally devoid of any emotion, and barely read with literacy, was a national disgrace.\nWe need people with a moral compass, with compassion, intelligence and understanding - or we need a massive overhaul of our Constitution. When Congress becomes merely a dependent of a mentally defective President, we are in deep trouble. Getting rid of trump would be beginning, but there would remain much more if we are to survive as a nation.\nThe irony of \"Make America Great Again\" is not lost on me - Trump has driven us down so far that this is what we must do just to get back to where we were a year ago!, 4 This is the new reality, we need to get used to it.\n\nIs anyone really \"surprised\"?, 4 Thoughts & prayers ring hollow.\nAt this point, every member of Congress, trump &  the NRA who refuse to enact protective measures are aiding & abetting every person who murders. Isn't that a crime to be prosecuted?\nComplicit in the murder of children & the people who REALLY protect them.\nSadly, there are so many guns out there, it seems impossible to control who shoots what.\nThe shame of taking money from the NRA  to feed your coffers; should break your heart., 4 President Trump and Congress will do nothing to stop unfettered access to guns because they are scared literally to death of the NRA., 4 Don't look to Trump to resolve this horrific endless loop. Trump said at the NRA convention in April 2017, \"You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you.\" \n\nThe NRA spent about $30.3 million in support of Trump's presidential campaign in 2016., 4 If this most recent killing of school children in Florida does not remove from the Congress all those legislators who have failed to protect the citizenry from gun violence, then I do NOT know what will.\n\nTake note of the Congressional Republican persons who have received monies from the NRA.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-...?\n\nIf your representative is in this group then you have a moral duty and obligation to vote them out of office at the first opportunity available.\nThere is no other solution. , 4 When did this country decide that the\"right\" to own an AR-15 was more important than the life of a 14 year-old?  Our congress is just as complicit in these murders as the actual shooter., 4 \"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\" \n\nThe first half of the 2nd amendment provides the context for the second half; I  why did the framers of the Constitution included the context if the right to keep and bear arms was unlimited? The NRA asserts it is so and the Supreme Court seems to concur., 4 So many people think the USA is number one. Yes we are in this scenario, world wide. We're Number 1 in gun related deaths.\nHonestly, it is nothing to be proud of.\nDo the research. Find the politicians receiving funds and support from the gun lobby and the NRA. Then vote for their opponent.\nIt is necessary to have this discussion now and necessary to take action to stop further destruction/death. Hoping I give a voice to all those lost and too their loved ones grieving., 4 Looking at the CONSTANT mass shootings in your country from over in Aus, one after another, these incidents are more and more bizarre to me..  sorry but can someone explain to me - an Aussie who has NEVER had to worry about being shot at work, at home OR at school.. \n\nWhy do you guys even SELL automatic and semi automatic weapons? Who needs these for \u2018hunting or self protection\u2019? Why is there demand for guns and ammunition to be readily available AT ALL? How is a seemingly small (yet wealthy) organization like the NRA able to affect so much public policy??? I just don\u2019t get it. \n\nBack when our politicians enacted strict gun policy there was outrage. Some politicians even lost their favor with their constituents and thus their jobs in politics... and yet, with time, not being able to just casually buy a gun or own a gun became the new normal- the loud minority of gun lovers moved on. \n\nI don\u2019t ever have to worry about my child being SHOT at elementary school.. the fact that you guys can\u2019t say the same thing with confidence in a wealthy democratic society is INSANE.  , 4  We are way past prayers from our so called leaders.\n\nCourageous leadership, to stand up for even a modest amount of gun control are what is needed here., 4 Since the government won\u2019t take action I urge high school students to declare a nationwide strike until Congress takes action to ban assault weapons. How many children have and will continue to be killed by such weapons in schools?, 4 I think this goes the culture of what America has become.  The ingredients are easy but the final product is complex.  Not unlike a fertilizer bomb I suppose.  \n\nA for profit media looking in every crevice of American society for a new way to attract eyeballs and generate advertising revenue creates a controversial narrative to gin-up a culture war and zero sum game; \n\n'Own as many guns as you want versus taking all of your guns away.'  \n\nThe irony is that neither of those narratives actually exist for 95% of Americans.  So we continue to have a debate fueled by emotion and targeting and manipulating low information and low education voters.  This is, as always, about money and power.  The NRA has hijacked our politicians through their donations and threats of 'primarying' them from the right.  \n\nI think that change will come with the millennial generation filling seats in local, state and federal elected office.  That will manifest into real change, but it will be another 10-15 years and many many children and Americans will die of gun violence before then., 4 In the 19th Century slavery was called \"the peculiar institution\".  I guess we can call these mass shootings that occur every few weeks \"our peculiar situation\".  Guns are deeply embedded in our society as slavery once was.  It took a war that killed a significant portion of the male population to get rid of slavery.   There will not be a war to curtail the omnipresence of guns.  I have to say that we will just have to get used to gun violence or emigrate.  Perhaps slavery would have perished eventually without a war but it would have taken many decades.  Maybe fifty or seventy years from now these mass shootings will diminish., 4 I won't criticize the ubiquitous \"we're praying for the families\" after each of these events. What I'm going to criticize is the complete lack of any thoughtful actions to address the situation. There hasn't been a single piece of effective legislation offered at the national level which attempts prevent or mitigate a reoccurrence.\nLots of action and fear to keep the bad terrorists out of America but nothing whatsoever for keeping us safe from our home grown problems. If there was any correlation between more guns and increased safety we'd have a much lower rate of homicides than we do. We lead the pack with ownership and death.\nI'm waiting for the mandatory laws to arm every teacher, ancillary school staff member, and a gun cache at every fire alarm to make us safer to be introduced. You move the goal posts to the extremes of acceptance it makes it easier to deflect on why we're grieving today, tomorrow, next week, and in the months ahead. Please get out and vote!, 4 I'm numb.\n\nThe pictures in sequence\u2014like a symphony of grief.\n\nThe little girl in blue at Sandy Hook. I can't get her face out of my mind.\n\nTHIS TIME SOMETHING WILL WILL WILL BE DONE, 4 Three percent of Americans own half the guns in the nation. \n\nThree percent own 155 million guns. \n\nThree percent own eight to 140 guns, each. \n\nAction taken by Congress to prevent 21,386 suicides by guns, zero. \n\nAction taken by Congress to prevent 11,208 homicides by guns, zero. \n\nAction taken by Congress to stem 345 mass shootings, zero., 4 Let us not allow any of the victims of these mass shootings to die in vain. Let the survivors, parents, the communities where these events have happened to continue to speak. The most moving comments I have heard have been from teenagers who are pleading for us as adults to ACT and change the situation. Similar to when parents from Newtown spoke from their pain to try to protect other children, these people touched directly by gun violence speak for the threats to all Americans, everyday, whether it be in mass shootings, handgun violence or suicide by gun use. Please respect their losses and trauma by not allowing them to be forgotten- allow them to speak and to continue to speak on this issue, not just this week, but in the coming months. Most Americans want the gun deaths in our country to be stopped-this cannot be addressed if we cannot talk about the facts and then ACT without being gagged and thwarted by the NRA and their corrupt politicians. We need the help of the media to break through this barrier and to protect our society from preventable deaths everyday. There are just too many guns, too easily obtained- it\u2019s that simple. We can fix this- we need to want it more than the NRA and their politicians want power and money., 4 If only Senator Marco Rubio, governor Scott and the president had the decency to mention the heroism of Coach Feis, the assistant football coach who died while shielding students.\nA far less heroic teacher and coach was Dennis Hastert when as speaker in 2004 did not even have the gumption to bring up for renewal the 1994 assault weapons ban. The so called Hastert rule hangs over the congress like mold.\nI really hate the whole ritual of naming legislation for a victim but Coach Feis ought to have his name on whatever legislation is introduced., 4 While we wait for legislation, which will not arrive while there is big money to be made from the manufacture and sale of guns, maybe we should work on changing the culture. Guns are not cool. Guns do not protect the everyday citizen. Guns do not compensate for weak character.  Change this idolatry and stop enriching those who gather wealth by encouraging the gun image., 4 When will America grow up?  It's obvious.  No one should possess automatic assault weapons.  Ban future sales, and figure out how to collect those in circulation.  Why is this so difficult?, 4  A nation where people have to live in fear of having their children slaughtered while in school while their  supposed leaders  refuse to do anything to address the problem has no right to call itself the land of the free. , 4 It\u2019s rather obvious that prayers are not solving this tragic problem. I suggest to the leadership of the GOP that by prohibiting the sale of military assault weapons like the AR 15, the number of fellow citizens massacred every few weeks, will go way down.  Yes, mental health is a problem, but other countries also have mentally disturbed individuals but no mass shootings., 4 If over two thirds of the country in polls says they support gun control legislation, where are they on Election Day?  Sitting at home or leaving boxes unchecked at whatever level of local, state or national office because a choice isn\u2019t perfect does nothing.  People need to take the time to see where candidates stand on the issues.  And not just reflexively vote a certain party.  It\u2019s time for two thirds, and more, of the country to send Washington a message that enough is enough.  Vote!, 4 If ever the phrase \u201cfollow the money\u201d was apt, it is here. For every lawmaker who expresses shock and grief while offering condolences, prayers, best wishes, and good thoughts; as they say it\u2019s \u201ctoo soon\u201d to talk about gun control, defend the 2nd Amendment, or make excuses why gun laws can\u2019t be tightened \u2014 how deeply are they beholden to the NRA? As we\u2019ve seen in the past few days, it totals in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. Can someone do the math? What does that average out to in terms of each victim? How much a single life for the money in their pockets?\n\nHiding this dependence on blood money behind faith and faux sympathy is hideous. \n\nLet\u2019s be honest: They place the filthy lucre over lives. , 4 Only in America. \n\nAfter Sandy Hook nothing was done. America tacitly agreed that the Second Amendment trumped the lives of children, and countless other citizens since. \n\nWhy should this massacre be any different? Why keep reporting the slaughter with such outrage? We own cars, we have traffic fatalities, we own guns, we have massacres. It is a part of the total-cost-of-ownership. Apparently the majority is fine with that calculus, so why all the thoughts and prayers and hand-wringing? , 4 Perhaps if the security at capital hill was as lax as it is at schools across the country, Congress would get some sense of urgency about gun control. They need to get out of the bubble and solve this, taking metal detectors out of the capital would be a great first step., 4 It will continue until voters rise up against the Republican Party, which has taken tens of millions of dollars in NRA money specifically to block any effective gun regulation.\n\nThe NRA has the money (much of it, according to recent reporting, from Russia) but we have our votes.  \n\nIf we sincerely care to fix this, we have to vote. , 4 I'm a gun owner but don't own an assault rifle.  They are designed for the specific purpose of killing as many people as is possible in the shortest time.  It is a military tool for assaulting a well defended position.  \n\nThere is absolutely no civilian use for a weapon of this nature.  It's useless for home defense and no one I know hunts with a AR-15.  \n\nThat these weapons can be purchased by the mentally ill, or anyone else is a result of spineless politicians who rely on NRA funding.  Moreover, the Second Amendment allows for the right to bear arms and a well regulated militia.  It says nothing about weapons of mass destruction. \n\nThe government should have the right to remove these weapons from society.  And yes, the government should be \"coming for your guns\" especially assault rifles.  The position that if assault rifles are banned the next thing will be the ban on all weapons is the usual spin by Republicans financed by the NRA.  This is a lie.  Most democrats I know and liberals as well don't want to abolish the second amendment.  They just don't want a weapon designed for assault in the hands of people that will use them for mass shootings.  Not an unreasonable position.  The government has the responsibility to keep people safe and our existing leadership have abandoned that responsibility.  If these weapons are not sold, no one could buy them.  And the argument that the bad guys will get them anyway is a lie.  Bad guys can't get weapons that don't exist.  , 4 I would say what we have here is proof positive that the only thing prayer does is alleviate the conscience of the one doing the praying.  Might as well toss a coin in a fountain and make a wish.  , 4 In Germany, there is lots of violence in schools. Kids fight with each other. What doesn't happen: mass shootings. As an expat from Kansas, I remember shooting a gun in the forest. I also remember a \"friend\" telling me she would take out her father's gun. I also remember the announcement in middle school about a \"Yellow Fiat\" which was codeword for: lock the classroom doors, active threat.\nAs a father in Germany, I am so happy that I don't have to worry about my sons being put in that danger. I still have a right to own a gun here. But like with driving a car, I need a license. To get a license, I need to learn how to use a gun with a professional, who can also assess whether I am mentally stable. And there are severe penalties if a gun owner breaks the law.  Why can't that be imposed in the US? , 4 The sale of weapons made for the battlefield has got to stop.\nI am so fed up with some gun owner's fetish with an AR-15, AK47 or some other military knockoff, being worth more than someones life.\nRestricting some weapons for military and police use only does not infringe upon a person's 2nd Amendment right.\nThere are still thousands of handguns and long arms a gun owner could choose from. No gun dealer would be put out of business.\nYes, Cruz most likely would have still gotten a gun, and still shot people if he couldn't have bought the AR-15. But with fewer rounds and more reloading we'd have maybe 4 dead and 3 injured, instead of 17 dead and at least 14 injured.\nEvery single person killed in these shootings is worth more than someone else's desire to own these guns.\nVote Democratic in November. We can make this stop., 4 When I saw the video posted on NYT, I did not see Republican or Democratic child.  They all fear for their lives and safety.  And until the government honestly cares about the people, is not bought by the NRA, pass sensible gun control laws, MORE AMERICANS, regardless of party affiliation, WILL DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE, when compared to all other developed nations.  , 4 looking forward to Trump going there.will only recommend more social workers or all teachers having guns.sad., 4 Revoke the 2nd amendment, put the gun companies out of business, make it a felony to possess, use, or produce a firearm in the U.S. and call it good. There's zero need in the 21st century for the 2nd amendment. Time to retire it. , 4 It is rather ironic that the United States is playing any kind of role at all in the Syrian conflict.  Gun violence has reached epidemic levels in America, to the extent that I no longer believe in a domestic solution to this problem.  \n\nThe international community should start to embarass American politicians by promoting UN investigations, possibly even sending UN peace keeping troops to areas of the United States statistically determined to be the most vulnerable to such wholesale bloodshed suffered by unarmed civilians.  Nothing else seems to be working.... Americans may well have to sacrifice a bit of their sovereignty for the future of their children !, 4 The time is now. Any politician who is funded by the NRA must be voted out of office. 2018 is the year we Americans stand up to the muscle and power of the NRA with this: our safety is more important than anyone\u2019s right to own a semi-automatic weapon. Children are more important than guns., 4 It's come time for kids in this country to do what adults have not: rise up, walk out of your schools in protest and don't return until something is done. March on Washington if you have to., 4 Stop and think for a minute, America.  We are a country with a huge problem.  A problem that we are told has only one solution: to turn all the nation's schools into armed compounds.  Like those in Afghanistan or Iraq or Lebanon or many other places where lawlessness rules.  We are told Americans have the right to carry whatever weapon they want anywhere they want in America.  Except where  politicians happen to be.  In those places no weapons are allowed.  So the solution is to arm our schools where innocent children spend their day.  And we are supposed to feel comfort from that.  We are then supposed to think these angry, disturbed young Americans will not load their weapon and play guerrilla warfare somewhere else.  And when they discharge their anger and their weapons some where else, we will turn that into an armed  compound too.  Until America becomes a war torn country.   Oh we will confiscate guns.....the ones used in the shooting.  But fear not, NRA, there are plenty more where these guns came from.  Do not get the impression the mental health system has a silver bullet. Medicaid is being cut and most commercial health insurance have limited, if any, coverage.  And, most important, there is a huge backlog of disturbed individuals out there, many who are probably cleaning their guns as we speak.   But, hey, America has priorities.  A wall.  Rounding up less violent illegals.  And making sure the wealthy have plenty of additional wealth.  , 4 We teachers were abuzz about the latest shooting yesterday, but there was a tone of helplessness in our responses. My fellow middle school teachers and I watch for the alarming students and practice our lockdown drills. We recommend students be counseled and/or removed but little happens. Our kids cower on the floor in drills, but I know the one officer we have won't keep out someone who is determined to harm others. We routinely hear gunfire in the neighborhood surrounding the football field that doubles as a break area for our students. It's our normal, your normal. \n\nMy only logical conclusion is that the people of the United States are fine with the slaughter of children on a mass scale in our schools. We are fine seeing the blood of children and their teachers spilled repeatedly. Our leaders and their constituents have decided that warfare should be practiced in our schools and that gun rights trump the right of children to live and attend school peacefully. Our leaders in particular have decided that blood money from the NRA is a sufficient blinder to the bloodbaths occurring in our schools, a powerful tonic for their pangs of guilt. \n\nThis must be true. Otherwise, assault weapons would have been banned, bullet sales would be limited, and strong security measures would be in place at our schools. Otherwise, someone, anyone, would have done something, anything, to end this insanity., 6 If Republican Senators and Congress folk would spend as much time on fixing our gun violence problem, which is a real problem, and truly dangerous, rather than wasting time pretending immigration is a real issue, imagine how much safer our country, and our most precious commodity, our kids, could be., 6 Think fast. Without looking it up on the internet, can anyone name 1 person off the top of their head who came to the rescue with their gun and took out any kind of shooter in America? So much for good guys having guns., 6 To all the parents in the US: It's all about political responsibilty - quote from NYT, Opinion, Editorial, Feb 15, 2017, \"Congress Says, Let the Mentally Ill Buy Guns\": \u201cFor all their dysfunction, the Republican Senate and House have managed to act with lightning speed in striking down a sensible Obama administration rule designed to stop people with severe mental problems from buying guns. President Trump, who championed the National Rifle Association agenda as a candidate, is expected to sign the regressive measure. ... I hope something truly awful doesn\u2019t happen because of this,...\u201d (Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut). Nothing more to say -act!, 6 This morning I heard NMP Trump say to the children of America \"We are here for you.\" Sorry kids, it's not true. They are not there for you. If they were, assault weapons would be banned. No arguments from anyone. Unanimous vote. It should be so clear. So easy. But no, you are collateral damage. The price you pay for our rights. Sorry., 6 The obvious answer- all high schoolers should be trained and armed so that they can defend themselves.\n\nHow do ya think that would turn out?\n\nNRA, let's hear your cockamamie rationale for the status quo. We're listening., 6 Years ago when I was growing up we didn't have this kind of violence.\nToday kids are so desensitized to violence. kids then become adults .\nWhen we went to the movies and the cowboy shot the Indian with his rifle  , or the Indian shot the cowboy with his arrow, they fell off their horses.no blood or extreme violence .\nToday the cowboy shots the Indian and his head blow off his neck, his leg gets shot off blood everywhere.\nThe cowboy gets the arrow in his eye face etc. blood everywhere , even the horses get killed.\nExtreme , extreme violence in the movies , videos .music songs and videos.\nWhat did you think was eventually going to happen to these kids. who become adults over the last twenty years.\nI'm surprise there was only 8 mass shooting this year.\nIt's a lot more deeper than blaming the NRA  exclusively for this rot. , 6 Why aren't we hearing more about the infringement of our 1st Amendment Rights?....you know, the right to Freedom of Assembly...\n\nTo me, Freedom of Assembly includes the right to assemble as part of a group, without having a reasonable fear of a mass shooter.  In the current environment of the US, most of us know FEAR being assembled as part of a large group.  And this is all BECAUSE of our lax gun laws.  So in other words, it is the very gun laws, which are lax, which are impinging upon everyone else's 1st Amendment rights.  \n\nWe need to approach gun reform from multiple angles, and I suggest we add talk about our 1st Amendment rights to that list., 6 Let's remember it when the next elections come ! No one supported by NRA (or similar). no one that takes money for election campaign from NRA or gun manufacturers, no one that voted in Congress to make it legal to bring concealed guns to all states in US, no one that supports Second Amendment rights as a right to almost unlimited access to guns (as it is now) should ever be elected to any position., 6 I think we can all agree that flooding the market with legally obtained narcotics caused the opioid crisis. I am not sure why we do not agree that flooding the market with firearms and large capacity magazines does not lead to more murders\nLet\u2019s face it, there is a segment of gun industry financed citizens who feel that the threat of the US government depriving them of their constitutional rights is higher than the chances of persons, ill suited to own and use firearms, killing others at school, work, home, Walmart, movie theaters or on the street.\nIf Sandy Hook and Las Vegas were not enough to silence these firearms extremists and their enablers, the Florida killings will not make a difference. All that is left, therefore, is desensitization to the horror., 6 If you pay dues to the NRA - this is what they are doing with your money - they are making sure that these weapons are so available that anyone, mentally ill, troubled, whatever, can get them. Yeah, there's talk of how they want to block the mentally ill - but then every bit of legislation to actually do something is killed by the NRA. Every singular time. \n\nIf you are paying dues to the NRA - this is what they are doing with it. It's your choice if you want to keep funding it., 6 Osama bin Laden didn't fly the planes into the World Trade Center, killing thousands but his words and acts facilitated it and he was considered Public Enemy #1.\nWayne LaPierre and the NRA don't do school shootings but they preach guns and a war on guns and freely get these weapons to ANYONE. They consider any representative who thinks there should be restrictions and infidels. He publicly \"grades\"them and tries to destroy their chances to be elected.\n\nNobody can deny the parallels although there is one difference. LaPierre is responsible for more domestic terrorism than any foreign terrorist groups combined.\n\nUntil someone in Congress has the guts to say, \"I respect your Second Amendment but I respect letting kids grow up more., 6 Unfortunately there are millions and millions of naive or stupid people who still believe that access to guns is not the cause of such mass shootings. These massacres very rarely happen in other countries, not in Europe, not in Middle East, not in Russia and China. The governments of these countries know how to protect their citizens and have better gun laws than ours. Our display of flags in ball games is to make us believe otherwise, that is we do everything better and are proud of it. We should instead keep silent for a minute to remember all these young people massacred in our schools., 6 Why does anyone need an AR-15?  Why is it easier to purchase an AR-15 than a handgun in Florida?  Why is there a federal law preventing ownership of handguns until the age of 21 but not for an AR-15, which you can purchase at 18 (and the shooter in this incident did)?  WHY.  Why would changing any of these facts be infringing on anyone's constitutional rights?  I think many of the people commenting here stating \"look at video games\" and \"look at mental illness\" may not have children they send to school each day, and suffer that terrifying thought of what if - what if it's my child.  They would do whatever it takes to prevent another tragedy.  That we make so many allowances for assault rifles and one's right to own them while scores of children die in these incidents is madness.  I'm a terrified parent., 6 I'm immune to the tragedies at this point (I mean after 20 babies in Newtown were slaughtered by a sad and troubled youth who needed help, not guns himself. The fact is that anyone can snap, and we are all at risk, in theory, from having moments of uncontrollable rage and/or anger. YES there is a tragic - TRAGIC - problem of untreated mental illness in this land. Terrorist who plot down to the last detail and carry evil acts should be boiled alive in burning oil but those like the boy who acted out in Newtown and others deserve our sympathy because they are also victims of a society that allows people EVEN ON TERROR WATCH LISTS from buying not a gun for recreation but a weapon of war! Any firearm that can spray 500+ rounds within minutes such as the one used in Vegas, well I can't engage in a rational discussion about the matter because anyone who for a split second could rationalize allowing that weapon into civilian hands is beneath my contempt and clearly cares more about his fictional interpretation of the 2nd Amendment than his own children and family.  It is NOT true that \"people kill people\" because if the boy at that school had had a knife and not a gun there wouldn't have been so many deaths of those young souls whose lives were lost. I recently studied an in-depth course on the teachings of Jesus, not a religion, but the man, as they apply to our daily lives and let me tell you folks Jesus is weeping for the way we have allowed our society to develop as of today. , 6 So many excuses - mental health, violent video games, music, whatever the excuse of the day may be - they are all just excuses to hide from the fact that without a gun able to fire large numbers of bullets in a fairly short time, these kids would still be alive.\n\nEvery other country in the world has mental illness. Every other country in the world has violent video games, heavy metal, so on and so forth. \n\nOnly we have these shootings regularly, and only we have so little regulation of guns. It's not hard to figure out, unless you really don't want to see it., 6 National Database to record, analyze, flag, put a HOLD, launch INVESTIGATIONS...on any individual whose buying patterns are cause for concern.\n\nChange laws so that private individuals can only buy items for hunting or self-protection.  That means NO gas masks, no ballistic vests, no UNLIMITED amounts of ammo, no semi's, no bumpstocks etc.\n\nWe need a National march on Wash D.C. and in front of the NRA's offices.\n\nTell every non-American you know to NOT visit the US this year...to send clear message to our govt. that non-Americans feel this country is simply too dangerous to visit.  Maybe THAT will make our govt sit up and take notice.  (In 2016, international visitors to the US spent $247.1 BILLION dollars.  If the tourists stop coming, our govt. will feel it!), 6 Trump offered \"prayers and condolences\" for the dead and their families, while all the while, he and his fellow Republicans are ramping up for the 2018 and 2020 elections with the largesse of the NRA and its supporters.\u00a0\n\nAnd again, another crazy American white guy, with easy access to buying arms, thanks to America's lack of gun control laws, was the killer -- not a foreign devil, as xenophobes fear.\u00a0\n\nWe're the only Western country that permits weapon ownership. Even most second and third world countries, have annual gun deaths in the double or single digits.\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. has more than 10,O00 gun deaths annually. While South America does beat the American gun death rate by percentage of population, it's not a point of pride to declare that we're less blood soaked than Colombia.\u00a0\n\nOur Constitution gave us the right to bear arms against a menacing foreign or domestic government. We could hunt with those flintlock rifles, too.\u00a0\n\nNow, we cannot form a militia powerful enough to fight foreign attack or a U.S. government bent on breaking Democracy. Hunters can use shotguns or bow and arrow. The need for handguns or military firepower is an anachronism.\u00a0\n\nThe U.S. should copy Australia, which, by forbidding and buying back arms, totally eliminated its gun death problem.\n\nThe U.S. has the most trigger-happy, bloodthirsty population in the world. Nero liked a lot of gore, too. This desire to kill, and the quick availability to do so, boosted by the NRA, is madness., 6 The U.S is not #1 where it counts. Not education, not healthcare, not economic equality, not childcare.\nBut we are far and away #1 in mass shootings, overall gun violence, mass incarceration and military spending.\nThat\u2019s not a coincidence.\nEvents like Parkland don\u2019t unfold inside a vacuum.\nAnd if our country was a person we\u2019d be seeking treatment for its mental health., 6 Face it, the 2nd Amendment was never intended to become a shield for mass murder enthusiasts. It's intent was to allow a group of citizens to be appointed an armed militia in case of a governmental emergency. To permit them to have a weapon to eliminate a logistical problem in a time of no organized military. The Supreme Court (Scalia?) booted this call by interpreting this dated clause to be applicable, no doubt under pressure from moneyed interests. Blame them. For such a respected August body of jurists, calls that they have booted or perhaps even sold out including Citizens United (Scalia?) are a black mark on their reputation. They have made decisions that would make a Grade 12 Civics class snort in derision. So much for the lifetime learned jurists., 6 Why would a Russian oligarch be a lifetime member of the NRA? (Russia has strict gun laws and would never emulate the US.)\n\nWhy would that oligarch meet with Trump junior after the nominating convention?\n\nWhy would the NRA triple its presidential political expenditures after Trump was nominated?\n\nI sincerely hope the Mueller investigation is closely looking at the actions of this Russian and the source of NRA funds used in the last election., 6 A generation of children haws grown up with mass shooting in their schools is part of their curriculum. The House of Representatives has massed a bill to make a concealed carry permit from one state to be honored by all states. Our congress is a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA and Wayne LaPierre. Thank goodness The NRA and our government are protecting the 2nd amendment right of our children to be gunned down in their classrooms and considerate it a normal occurrence.  When do we say enough and stop this madness? We are becoming one of the most dangerous countries on earth. and the NRA constantly says more guns make us safer. More guns do not make us safer but they do make the weapons manufacturers more profitable and that is what the NRA is all about., 6 Let's put aside the most recent Florida school shooting. It's clearly too early to discuss that. \n\nBut certainly it's way past time to discuss the countless other mass shootings and 30,000  killed by guns every year. \n\nTrump wants to revamp our immigration policy because a handful are killed by recent immigrants or the American born children of immigrants. \n\nInnocent Americans are dying by the thousands at the hands of other Americans. Let's deal with the much bigger problem first., 6 This happens in the US so often now that it can no longer be called shocking. When will there be enough carnage to get the majority to stand up to the gun lobby and the Congressmen who enable this slaughter? , 6 So far, the only way Republican officeholders have found to keep guns away from mentally ill people is to make guns more available. Somehow it doesn't seem to be working...\n\nIt also makes me concerned about who's actually in our well regulated militias., 6 \nI vehemently disagree with the notion of capital punishment.  However, every time one of these heinous, hideous, horrific and murderous situations occur, I find myself sadly endorsing and supporting the taking of the life that violently stole so many innocent lives., 6 My heart breaks, as does everyone's for the kids, families, teachers, school, and the killer himself.  What agony of spirit and blindness of hate drives someone to kill?  This is an issue bigger than guns; it is an issue of rescuing the human spirit.  I can only pray for a stronger sense of divine Truth and Love to take hold in our lives, as moral courage, through our actions, words, interactions, and inner dialogue.  We must help educate ourselves and our children with Spiritual Science so that the temptations of matter, the pile of daily disappointments don't take a wicked turn.  This battle engages each of us in vigilance, honesty, and less fear of what others will think, all tempered by the humility to seek help higher than our own.  Events like this are a call not to get more angry, but wiser about the requirements of a higher Love, necessary for a life of liberty for every man, woman, child.  That would be enough to prevent events like this., 6 Why do complicate the issue so much. Easy access to guns by unstable people equals murders and mass shootings.On top of this ,when people are reported for unstable behavior they fall through the cracks. The people most likely to stop a mass shooting are the people that are closest to the future gunman. Adam Lanza's mom, The Las Vegas gunman's girlfriend, this kid's caregivers. All of them saw a change in behavior, knew they had access to firearm's and chose to ignore all the warnings., 6 The NRA owns us.  Pure and simple. , 6 Request to the New York Times: If it is allowed by law, please publish the name of Senators and US Representatives who oppose guns control so we can decide who we will vote for, 6 If this tragedy is because God has a plan for us, He is not getting prayers from me anymore. \" My prayers are with you and your families. \" The bloody hypocrites!, 6 FEB 28 2017 - Trump Signs Bill Revoking Obama-Era Gun Checks for People With Mental Illnesses\n\nFEB 15 2018 - The president calls the Florida high school gunman \u2018mentally disturbed\u2019, 6 How will justice be served when the people at the top, Trump, with his hate rhetoric that mobilized the neo-nazi movement that trained this kid will not be punished? It starts at the top, make no mistake about it; Trump and his republican minions, the NRA and the people who voted to end research at the CDC about gun violence are to blame. The kid who did this was obviously sick mentally but his hate was propelled and nurtured by the people above and they should be the ones taking full blame. , 6 If the deaths of 20 first graders didn\u2019t make us do anything about guns, why will this.\n\nWe have to acknowledge the role that race plays in all of this.  Republicans want unfettered access to guns because they think they\u2019ll protect from what they fear the most- blacks and Hispanics.\n\nGuns are another example of how the racism that lies at the heart of the all white Southern GOP warps this country , 6      My Condolences to all the families and survivors. I would like to bring up this point. Although Now is not the time to talk about it, is exactly the reason we need to talk about it.\n\n     Why do we give the shooter so much attention?  This is the guy that everybody hates, yet the press can't stop talking about him. Before this is over, we will know more about this killer and his family, that we know about the Trumps.\n\n      What's wrong with our media, do they not understand that giving this idiot all this attention, just makes other, idiots, loners or mentally unstable people want to copy this guy, so they can get all the attention. It would be the high point of their lives and since they do not have much of a life anyway, they finally found something worth dying for.\n\n      Why can't the media just say, the killer was a former student. Why do we give this guy any  attention than he does not deserves. His photos will be all over the media for the next year. A year from now, nobody will be able to name any of the victims, but everybody will remember the name of the shooter\n\n       WHAT\"S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE ? \n\n       We just can't keep guns dominating our society. For the record, I do not disapprove of gun ownership, but with gun ownership comes gun responsibility. Maybe it is time to tone down on the gun rhetoric and concentrate on learning to solve issues by logic and reason. Today's culture in America is grab your gun first, ask questions later.\n\nTHIS HAS TO STOP, 6 This is a sad thing for me to admit, but I just don't give a darn anymore about these shootings.  When you lived as long as I have, and seen your fellow countrymen beat their breasts about mass shooting while voting for GOP politicians who don't care a wit about stopping the carnage and, in fact, are more than willing to facilitate more of it, you just start to tune out the whole mess.  Time and time again we've see kids and adults all over the country being gunned down by people with semi-automatic and automatic weapons designed specifically to kill people in wars followed by public breast beating and protestations by half the political establishment of how it's either too soon, too late, or too unconstitutional to even discuss measures that will limit access by the insane to military grade weapons.  So I figure that, as a society, we are getting exactly what we deserve.  After all there's no freedom like \"freedumb\".\n\nI am sorry for the loved ones of the victims, but frankly, not that sorry.  This is something we have collectively decided to inflict on ourselves as a nation, so until we decide otherwise, I'm done with agonizing over the issue.  , 6 The NRA must go. Someone please find a way to dismantle them.\nPlease., 6 Over to you, NRA. Let's hear what kind of flimsy defense you'll offer us now., 6 Just imagine how this news is being received overseas. In the eyes of the world, the US is no longer a shining city on a hill.  It is a stupid insane place where people prefer to own guns than see their children come home safely from school. It is like Afganistan in the hands of NRA.  , 6 Politicians who have sold their souls to the NRA are responsible for arming all of these murderers. In Florida, any 18 year old can easily buy one of these military level weapons, and carry it in plain sight. The politicians in Florida armed this very young man. He, in that sense, is as much a victim as the 17 dead and the grievously injured. He will be treated as a caged animal for the remainder of his life, and the dead will lie in their coffins forever.\n\nAll politicians who accept NRA monies live with blood dripping from their greedy hands, and all are guilty of arming these murderers., 6 The gunman trained w/ a white supremacist group & had a gun originally designed for war w/ abundant supplies of ammunition. There have been 18 mass shootings at US schools since January 1.\n\nThe time for \"thoughts and prayers\" is OVER!!! , 6 \"Trump Says School Safety and Mental Health Is Priority\".  Someone who actually cares about the sad state of affairs in this country would look the NRA down a barrel and disband them completely. 45 is complicit in all of this and a raging liar. His hands are dirty and everyone knows it.\nBETTER GUN LEGISLATION NOW, 6 As a loving father, my prayers go to all parents who lost their beloved ones and also to those who might loose their beloved ones in the future by gun-addicted males. But: Shame on your so-called civilized country - everything has been written and said about gun control in the past  and time is up for your nation-wide outcry: Parents' March to White House, Capitol Hill, and NRAHQ has to be put on your agenda in order to prevent coming tragedies in your schools and universities, on your streets and places. And: Not to forget - your Second Amendment was enacted on December 15, 1791 and a reform is simply due. My thoughts are with the victims of violence on our tiny blue planet., 6 Speaking frankly, Trump can just shut-up! Trump supported Alex Jones, a fake news radio personality-nut-job-conspiracy-theorist and court determined UNFIT dad, who's gone out and publicly sad he believes Sandy Hook shooting was faked so GOVERNMENT and PRESIDENT OBAMA could take all guns away from US citizens. So basically, anything Trump says about the tragedy is dis-genuine and insulting to the victims families. Given Trump's track record, I'm sure he'll just say the parents are just as-fault as the gun manufacture for letting their kids go to these job-killing LIBERAL public schools that let in illegal immigrants and minorities., 6 The Florida governor, Senators, and the NRA should face similar charges of murder., 6 Arrest his parents too while we are at it.  They knew nothing about what their kid was doing? How is this any different from the Muslim parents who were sentenced for not informing feds their sons joined ISIS?, 6 Let's reveal it for the truth it is. A new conspiracy theory - the NRA method of population control - with our children as the innocent victims., 6 Maybe if we could have a mass shooting at an NRA Convention or a Trump rally then someone might start listening. Until then let the death merchants chock on their thoughts and prayers   , 6 How was the shooter caught?, 6 GOP is in the hands of the NRA....so ANYONE can buy an AR-15 over the counter....what can possibly go wrong?, 6 \"Daddy?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"Can we talk about gun control now?\", 6 Every politician who is in the NRA's back pocket should be charged with these murders.  And the murders in Vegas.  And the murders at Sandy Hook.  And the murders in Orlando.  And...and...and...   They all have blood on their hands.  Do they really think this is what our Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote the 2nd Amendment?  I have no idea why they are so concerned about saving the lives of the unborn when this is the reality all those babies have to look forward to.  Pro Life my eye!, 6 Can we please have a nationwide campaign saying that guns are for cowards?  Big bad hunters with their automatic rifles going into the woods to hunt.  What a bunch of cowards.  How about a bow and an arrow instead?  NRA are really just a bunch of cowards.  How many NRA members are actual combat veterans who have faced a real enemy?, 6 AUSTRALIA.  Period., 6 I hope everyone remembers that \"... now isn't the time to talk about gun control.\" \"Now is the time to pray for the victims.  Our sincerest condolences go out to everyone involved and are prayers are with the victims and their families at this tragic time.\"\n\nGuess you didn't pray hard enough after Columbine.\n\nGuess you didn't pray hard enough after Newtown.\n\nGuess you didn't pray hard enough ....\n\nOh, never mind., 6 Just like the Las Vegas shooting, a week later all will be forgotten.  Clearly the terrorists are  the republicans in congress and Trump who pay homage to the NRA. , 6 The Trump administration and Republicans made it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns.  , 6 Watching tv in Europe tonight: Berlinale, the opening ceremony of the int.film festival, or alternatively, the Olympic games. Tuning to the CNN or NBC: another nightmare shooting!\nWhy doesn't America  protect its children?, 6 We have the power of the vote and our voices.\nEnough with excuses vote these politicians out, we worry about terrorist all the time. We have a out of wack budge for terrorism, we are building a wall. We are the domestic terrorists we kill each other day in and day out posting  activities on Facebook etc. If adults aren't killing each other it's The police who don't understand mental illness.\nThe monster is us, when do we see our own refection in the  Mirror and stop our own madness. Prayers don't restore the lives of our fellow human beings. Only ballot,action and supporting each other.  Don't let this killing become commonplace. Don't listen to another white house lie about its to soon to talk about gun control.\nIt's 2018 not the wild wild west anymore , 6 If your members of Congress are Republicans and you care about your children (or for that manner ANY children), please contact them and ask for stricter gun laws. At this point, only ONE Democrat receives any money from the NRA - $1,000 for Rob Cueller from Texas.  \n\nTop 5 recipients of NRA funds listed below. Target members of Congress in Arizona, Colorado, and North Carolina. They're holding America hostage. \n\nSenate:\nMcCain Arizona $7.4 million\nRichard Burr North Carolina $7 million\nRoy Blount Missouri $4.5 million\nThom Tillis North Carolina $4.4 million\nCory Gardner Colorado $3.9 million\n\nHouse:\nFrench Hill Arkansas $1.1 million\nKen Buck Colorado $800K\nDavid Young Iowa $707K\nMike Simpson Idaho $386K\nGreg Gianforte Montana $345K\n\nMore information:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-..., 6 Once again, we react with shock and call for prayers for the family.  Time for some straight talk. You are responsible for the deaths of these children:\n-You contribute to the NRA, you proudly display your NRA decal and your defiant bumper stickers, you vote for representatives who oppose gun control. You are responsible for the deaths of these children and many others.\n-You profit from gun sales, insisting that it is our right to own as many handguns and assault rifles as we selfishly desire, because \"this is America.\"  Well, it has become America, and you are responsible for the thousands of deaths that feed your profit machine.\n-You continue to take hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars from the gun lobby and abdicate your responsibility as a representative for the good of the people. \"Public servant\", indeed.  You are responsible for these deaths.\n-Ignoring the facts, you have convinced yourself that you, your family, and your community are safer because you carry.  You are responsible.\n-You insist that our constitution guarantees the right to own handguns and assault rifles, and ignore the fact that this narrow interpretation has made us the most pathetically deadly nation on earth. You are responsible for these deaths.\n-You may attack me and these truths, but you remain responsible for the many deaths yet to come.\n-, 6 I wish just one of these survivors or related persons would yell at those mouthing the same old words:  \" you lime light lovers should elect a single spokesperson, and the rest of you get back to your offices and DO SOMETHING EFFECTIVE! about these recurring tragedies\".  \n\nCripes, same ol', same ol'.  Enough with these elected glory seeking pontificers.  THEY are the problem., 6 Republicans have been bought and paid for with MANY millions of dollars by the NRA and the gun lobby. As Bess Kalb so eloquently said: \"We're coming for you\" in the next election. We hold YOU responsible for this negligence and failure to act which has resulted inch so many deaths. If this had happened in another country, you would be so self-righteous in condemnation, but fail to act in your own back yard. YOU were elected to prevent this, and YOU have proven shamefully incompetent and derelict.\nSHAME ON YOU. You do not deserve any support from any decent Americans!, 6 Congress -- your unwavering support of the NRA is tantamount to child sacrifice. \n\n\"In God We Trust.\" Which god exactly are Americans sacrificing their children to? , 6 A modest proposal (thank you Jonathan Swift): tired of shootings with automatic or semiautomatic weapons? Tired of the government doing nothing about it? Tired of shootings at school? Somebody pick a day, or a week even, and boycott. Don't send the kids to school. Don't send the grandkids to school. Are you a teacher or a school administrator? Stay home, and support an end to legal automatic weapons. How about April 16th? The 15th is a Sunday., 6 Thank God, this was not a terror incident.\nHeartbraking, but \"business as usual\" / \"just a normal school shooting\".\nAmericans need guns to protect themselves!\n(Did you perceive the irony)??, 6 The GOP should be named as co-defendants. , 6 Obviously God does not bless America, but punishes it regularly!, 6 Our lawmakers are paid (some would say bribed) by special interests especially the NRA.  There is no logical reason to allow this type of weaponry in the hands of a non-military individual.  The only way to solve this is to vote out the people in Congress that accept NRA donations and demand term limits for Congress.  Why in the world do we have professional politicians?!  The longer in office, the more corrupt they become.  It is obvious that they do not care about its citizens as thousands of people get needlessly killed.  Start a new movement #NoMoreDeadChildren.  Oust them!!  Enough already!, 6 Where was the good guy with a gun?\nTragic, tragic, tragic. Disgusting.\nAnd guess what? Lawmakers will do nothing again.\nUseless cowards, all of them.\n\nThis country is suffering from a social disease of gundamentalism and ammosexuality.\n\nNo other western country suffers from this sickness.\nYou know what the real reason is?\nEasy access to weapons and too many of them.\n\nHave you hugged your weapon today?, 6 Lets pour more trillions into the military while our own citizens are massacring each other on a daily basis. \n\nAmerica: the most sickening place on earth., 6 Every gun owner, who places their sick hobby above public health is responsible. \n\nEvery Republican in the United States is responsible.\n\nThey need to be held to account. , 6 When a fish rots it starts at the head!\nThe US is a very sick society and because of a tiny, wealthy but powerful lobby, it's only going to get worse!\nThe blood of these children rests squarely on the shoulders of the men, like Wayne LePierre, who are in control of the NRA and their spineless lackeys in the US Congress!, 6 No American is prepared to do what is necessary to change your insane gun laws so all Americans deserve to be shot to death by a random stranger.\n\nYou apparent want this to happen - it's deeply psychotic - so if you disagree with my assessment, I'll put it down to you being mentally ill., 6 Dear Editor,\nDue to numerous gun incidents recently (Not to forget about 2017), we have had many incidents with GUNS and \u2018mass shooting\u2019.\nWe have also seen no reaction from Congress or the President regarding curbing the \u2018Gun Laws\u2019, in spite of these numerous \u2018mass shootings\u2019\nSuggestion:\nWould you please run an up to date tally of all the fatality of 1) \u2018Gun\u2019 related shooting and 2)\u2018Terrorist\u2019 related shooting of the year to date, and maybe of the last few years in a small box somewhere on the first page of New York Times paper \u201cEVERY DAY\u201d until the Congress do something about \u2018Gun Control\u2019 in this country.\nBest Regards,\nMoji Hoss\nSnellville, Ga., 6 \u2022 \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d one student yelled over and over in one video circulating on social media....\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d President Trump wrote on Twitter. \n\n\"When the other girls dropped to their knees to pray, I took a run for it.\"\n~ ELLEN SHINE CALLAGHAN\n(1891 - 1993)\nFormer Speaker of the New York City Council Christine Quinn\u2019s grandmother,\nTitanic survivour\n\n\"Nothing fails like prayer.\"\n~ ANNIE LAURIE GAYLOR\nCo-founder of the Freedom From Religion Foundation , 6 A report that Cruz made a youtube video and a comment elsewhere of his intentions to be a \"\"professional school shooter\" leaves one waiting for an explanation by the same agency successfully investigating the loss of a terra cotta thumb in Philly. , 6 School children in the U. S. continue to get slaughtered because Congress is too cowardly to stand up to the NRA and prevent mass murderers from obtaining weapons. When is this insanity going to stop?!, 6 Candidates who will win election to office in midterms are those who call armed responsible, armed individuals in public places and schools and who advocate for swift execution of all condemned inmates in the country. That a football coach needs use his own body as the only response to a known individual who has expressed an intention to shoot students is pathetic., 6 It's becoming harder and harder to say, \"I'm proud to be an American.\" Due to the craven indifference of half of our government to the welfare of the people, we are continuously exposed to madmen with military-style semi-automatic weapons with large magazines who shoot up our concerts, schools and even churches. These government representatives are too afraid to act for fear of antagonizing the industry that manufactures the weapons used repeatedly in mass shootings, and thereby losing that precious financial support for their campaigns. Every one of these hypocrites is putting his political livelihood ahead of the lives of innocent Americans, often children. How dare they talk about family values? Disgusting!, 6 For 70 years Russia has been trying to create chaos in the US by promoting the irrational American Gun Fetish and helping promote the spread of drugs use.   Now they have the passive and active participation of the NRA which they've infiltrated and the Republican Party which show signs of that infiltration as well., 6 If the Republicans in Congress were not paid by the NRA, they would close the background check loopholes, and impose sensible gun laws to lessen the number of mass murders by white American terrorist males. , 6 I put full blame the Republicans who just last year decided to allow the mentally ill to own guns. Not one of them should be offering condolences, but instead looking at the grief they have caused. No one is safe with these politicians in power. Every school needs to have metal detectors., 6 Nope, still waaaay too soon for gun control. Don\u2019t you hear the silence from Congress? , 6 We can waste more time and look more pathetic by nattering on about thoughts and prayers, or we can organize a three day strike. Students, if you value your lives at all, take the first step. Organize a three day protest. No school. Hit the streets around your school and tell the Republicans and Trump we\u2019re dying in our schools., 6 The real shame hear is that if this fool gets the death penalty it most likely won't be carried out until he's about 50.\nAs part of his punishment they should make him see the news footage of what he did every day until it sinks in and hopefully it would., 6 Read the constitution. Personal gun ownership is only a right in well regulated militias.  It is clearly spelled out. Read the constitution., 6 I have rethought an old saying: Guns and stones will hurt my bones but words will not console me. We need more than consolation and prayers for the victims and families. We need better laws to keep assault weapons and bump stocks regulated., 6 Trump Signs Bill Revoking Obama-Era Gun Checks for People With Mental Illnesses\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-signs-bill-revoking-obama-era...\n\n\"Both the House and Senate last week passed the new bill, H.J. Res 40, revoking the Obama-era regulation.\n\nTrump signed the bill into law without a photo op or fanfare.\u00a0\", 6 Show the photos of the bodies.\n\nShow Congress, and the people they claim to represent, what an angry teenager and an AR-15 rifle can do.\n\nThese images should be projected on the walls of the United States Capitol.\n\nSHOW THEM, 6 We need to ban semi-automatic rifles.  (But we won't.)  We also need to have conversations about toxic masculinity in the USA.  When you read about the sad sack who did these shootings, you read about someone who wanted to mean something to someone, wanted to have an impact in some way, and couldn't do it in a healthy way, so did it in this stupid, callous, cruel way instead.  America has very strict, very tight standards for manliness (bro culture), and few of them are healthy.  The boys I see in the school I teach in have only one way to be (namely, a bro), and if they aren't like that, they are rejected and teased as been gay.  European male culture is much, much healthier than American male culture.  Time to start addressing this.  Gun ownership is high in some Scandinavian countries, but school shootings are almost non-existent.  This is because boys in those countries are much more free to be themselves, to ask for help, to be different, not to be macho, than here in the US., 6 GUN SAFETY!  There ARE words!  The murderer told people of his violent preoccupations, but nobody had been trained or oriented to report such speech to the school administration nor the school administration to the police to seek a search warrant of the murderer's home, which would have turned up the weapons.  There are consistent patterns among mass shootings:  1)  collection of weapons and ammo; 2)  telling people of violent intent indirectly/symbolically;  3)  a severely stressful event that triggers the rage so that the murderer decides to act out the fantasies of shooting and killing.  Another part of the pattern is EASY ACCESS TO GUNS!  THAT'S A FACT, WHETHER THE NRA AGREES OR NOT!  States with strict gun safety laws have less frequent gun violence, while states with lax gun safety laws have more frequent gun violence.  Message to the NRA:  IT'S THE GUNS STUPID!, 6 If the football coach, a real hero, had had a gun, the senseless shooting would have been over., 6 I feel like there is more probability of getting killed in this kind of meaningless shootings at school, mall, movie theaters than actual terrorist attack. , 6 If the foot ball coach, a real hero, had had a gun, the senseless shooting would have been over., 6 Small price to pay for historic bonuses for CEOs of weapons firms!, 6 I am in Canada. What is wrong with you Americans? Why do you allow every person with a grudge or someone who is mentally ill have access to guns? This is NOT a tragedy- it is predictable and inevitable.It will happen again and again until you have gun control.  There are dangerous people everywhere yet only in the land of the free and the home of the brave does this mayhem occur. You call this free? You call this brave? Shame on all of you who continue to let this happen., 6 Nothing will be done.  No one in Washington cares.  They. Don\u2019t. Care., 6 I want to know why the Second Amendment's \"well regulated militia\" keeps shooting at unarmed students.  , 6 Gun control?  Both sides have it wrong.  They speak in absolutes.  That will not get us anywhere.\n\n2nd Amendment supporters, here's a fallacy: \"Guns don't kill people, people do.\"  Wrong.  People *with guns* kill people.  Keep up your simplistic thinking, and children will keep dying.\n\nGun control supporters, here's a false hope: \"We must stop the killing!\"  Wrong.  You won't.  2nd Amendment types say you can't prevent all gun violence and that's a fact.  But you can prevent much of it.  Lower your sights and we could all get safer.\n\nScience--reported here in the Times--proves that the only--only!--factor that explains the rate of gun death in the USA is the raw number of guns.  Not the NRA.  Not video games.  Not poverty.  Not our culture.  Not Congress.  It is only--only!--about that.  \n\nTherefore, our goal should be not to eliminate guns but to reduce their number.  Fewer guns = fewer shootings.  Ban guns?  Won't happen.  Do nothing?  What kind of human being are you?  \n\nBoth sides, get it together.  The thing to stop is the useless screaming of absolutes.  We don't want perfection, zero guns deaths.  We want fewer.  We can get that.  Our kids deserve that.  We can all be safer and still be American., 6 Trump's  words are hollow as long as he and the rest of the GOP continue to pander to the Wayne LaPierre of the NRA and the Gun Lobbyists. \n\nTrump and the GOP seem to use the NRA and Gun Lobbyists talking points every time these mass killings happen, it is always okay to bring up mental health, but a not okay to talk about banning Assault Military style killing machines used and enhanced background checks, something is wrong with these cowards and sell outs to the American People., 6 No more prayers, no more comments like \"you lost your child today\".  Your kid was not lost but killed by guns.  Congress has blood on their hands and are totally to blame for allowing automatic weapons to be sold in the US.  There is no place for automatic weapons since schools and other venues are not battle fields. Congress needs to act now to control guns in the US.  How many more innocent lives must be lost due to their ignorance and hubris?, 6 Nothing will ever get done.   We've already decided that the interests of hobbyists and the paranoid come before the lives of children.  NRA members in particular can pat themselves on the back for a job well done.  Our children aren't safe at school but, by golly, you can buy as many guns as you want!  , 6 Story problem#1.   YOU are driving down a road and there is a vehicle coming at you in your lane.  You are unable to get out of the way.  Would you rather be hit by a A) compact car B) Hummer. C). 18 wheeler D) golf cart\n\nStory problem #2: YOUR child, grandchild, spouse or best friend is at a mall or school and you find out there is an active killer there. Would you rather he be armed with a A) handgun, B) semi-automatic assault weapon C)  knife D) baseball bat?, 6 NOTHING will happen until we hold our representatives accountable. We are, as voters, not doing enough. There are some basic issues. (1) Greed - look at how many congresspersons get NRA funding. (2) Stupidity - look at how many congresspersons still refuse to connect gun availability with gun deaths. (3) Lack of moral fiber - look at how heartless and soulless our congresspersons are simply by their inaction when so many children and adults die from gun violence. It's simple - we ask for action or don't vote for these heartless fools. Nothing else will solve this problem., 6 How much money YOUR representative/senator/governor taken from the NRA?\nHold them accountable.\nNo more votes to recipients of blood money, 6 There is no reason on earth why a nineteen year old kid needs multiple thirty round magazines and hundreds of 5.56 ball ammo unless he is in a firefight in Afghanistan.  If our lawmakers are dumb enough to keep allowing unfettered access to AR15s and twenty and thirty round magazines they need to go away.  The NRA owns our government., 6 In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun.  What does that say about how the State of Florida views the safety of their children., 6 So I guess we have The Constitution and lawyers who manipulate it to thank for all this misery.  At least a dictator has a face and can be purged in a junta if things get bad enough.  We\u2019re helpless and powerless to this phantom., 6 One thing we can count on as we wring our hands and grind teeth over tragedies like this; the NRA and their political accomplices in murder will do everything in their power to block any and everything that smacks of rationality even in the matter of mental health., 6 It would be easier to arm all the students than it would be to take one persons gun away.  That's not sad, it's pathetic., 6 Perhaps the NYT should\nx print all the comments on all the school shootings in the 2017/18 reporting so far ,\nx publish them as a book and\nx send them to Mr. Trump, the President of the NRA and those Republicans in Congress who still defend the 'Right to Carry a Gun' for every American.\n\nIt will probably be the saddest book ever published., 6 Students should go on national strike and refuse to return to class until politicians act.  They will continue to be failed by Republicans and the NRA, and die, until they take matters into their own hands., 6 How many innocent school children will be senselessly slaughtered by a profoundly troubled adolescent before the NRA and Wayne La Pierre yield to legislation that demands thorough screening before purchase of firearms AND a ban on automatic weapons?, 6 Typical reporting - the killers name is highlighted and smeared all over the headlines. Just once I would like to see absolutely no mention of names of the individuals responsible for this. Their names certainly should not appear in the headline or even brief article synopsis. They should be reduced to a one line foot note. But yet media insists on shining the spotlight on the gunman and not the victims. , 6 From the Washington Post this morning:  \"The National Rifle Association spent more than $30 million to help elect Trump president.\", 6 He trained with a white nationalist militia--they have confirmed it. What race and ethnicity were the children he targeted? The white nationalists are our greatest terrorist threat today and they have the endorsement of our president. Shame on him and on his blaming the victims. He always goes lower than anyone can even imagine., 6 We are now at the point that we must fear for our children and our country- not from ISIS, or the Taliban or Al-Queda, but from the NRA.\nOur Congress is ultimately controlled by the NRA and we have seen the results., 6 So this shooter, now deemed mentally ill, was not qualified to purchase a hand gun but he was able to buy the weapon of choice for every mass shooter since Sandy Hook; 1518 mass shootings using the AR14, purchased legally, and according to Trump, even if you're mentally ill.  Can there be a correlation between the FBI's investigation of Russian money laundering through the NRA for Republicans.  It explains everything.  , 6 The Second Amendment says \u201cwell regulated\u201d.\nWhat part does the NRA and the guns-for-all crowd not get?, 6 We have no one, nothing to fall back on in this country.  We are fast becoming an anarchy.  No one is in charge.  Not Congress. Not the president.  How can these people say they are in control when they have abdicated that place where morality and ethics live and taken up residence where their \"base\" and  the lobbyists live?  We have slid into the zone of anything goes- with no controls, no limits, no boundaries on anyone.  You like to shoot?  Go for it. Democracy?    Freedom of everything no matter who we hurt?  We have a Constitutional right to hurt people?  To kill them?  And then blame it all on mental illness or \"outsiders' who get into the country illegally?  We are NRAmerica. \n\nWe are burdened with inequality, but perhaps some of those very wealthy men and women will actually save us from ourselves.  Bezos, Buffet and Dimon may bring health care for us all.  Musk may get us to Mars.  Maybe some other person at the top of the pyramid will shake us into sense about gun control.  About saving our children.  About never having  to send a child to school in fear for his life.  In fear for her life.  \n\nStop the MAGA stupidity.  Mere words from fools who cannot produce one single day of safety in this land.  Their heads are in their charts, trying to see how they can gerrymander this and shut down voting rights there.  So they can win.  Win to do nothing.  Win to lose because our children are growing up know ing their country doesn't care about them., 6 Make all the guns illegal and ban them.  We all know how well that worked with drugs and alcohol. , 6 Mentally ill people do not shoot people; mentally ill people with guns shoot people.  Take the gun out of the equation.  \n\nHold politicians accountable for not doing so., 6 Ban all gun purchases for anyone less than 30 years of age. (except for military and law enforcement people) It seems than young men are more prone to this type of behavior (The nut in Vegas might be an exception). Also ban all assault rifles. Hunters don't use these type of guns. Assault weapons were designed for one thing....to kill people. They serve no other purpose., 6 Does Trump \"totally oppose\" mass murder? And how does Trump have the gall to diagnose anyone's mental health and to blame the mass shooting of the week  on another person's mental condition? You don't have to be legally insane to commit mass murder. But you do need access to weapons of mass destruction which, apparently, is a sacred right in this madhouse of a nation. , 6 As a LCSW in FL I can identify 2 avoidable deficiencies. First, a 19 year old male with MH symptoms, an obsession with firearms, accumulating them, recent threatening behavior and intent to act on those threats. In FL an adult may be involuntarily stabilized on a CSU up to 3 days. In FL, Medicaid/other ins. will not routinely pay for treatment longer than that. The shooter may have had ACA, perhaps kicked off the ACA per Republican legislation. Who would pay for his MH treatment? Not MCD, ACA and likely not the individual.\n\nSecond, in FL any non-felonious adult who has knowledge of firearms, can purchase an assault weapon without registering, no background checks, and despite history of MH problems/violence, can easily purchase, modify any weapon to kill. We can thank Trump and Gov. Scott for this moral outrage.  On 2/28/17 Trump signed a bill revoking Obama-era gun checks for people with mental illness. So even if FL had these protections (which it doesn\u2019t due to Gov Scott), and even if the shooter had received MH treatment, he maintains his right to own, modify and carry an AR-15 which has no place in our society. How dare Trump blame others for not \u201creporting these instances to authorities.\u201d Nothing of significance could be done anyway. Trump and Republicans HAVE the ability to tell the NRA \u201cno more subsidizing mass shootings.\u201d We need to hold Trump and NRA-subsidizing representatives totally accountable for this tragedy and all the other mass shootings. God help us., 6 I\u2019ve got my \u201cdeath Tat\u201d. I lost two uncles to guns in my home in Florida (my mother lost two of her three brothers.) I also witnessed my good friend Roy Williams shot in the chest by the father of a kid from the street. I was ten or eleven at the time. A childish prank amongst kids that resulted in a boy going home in embarrassment followed by the boy\u2019s father coming to the scene and putting a bullet into the chest of another child \u2013 Roy was 17. I remember holding his sister as I walked down street with the realization that her big brother was \u2026GONE.\nElections have consequences.\nIndiana voted for the current person in the White House. The Nation is beginning to get what it voted for. It will get worse before it gets better. When unthinking people give power to an immoral person- bad things usually occur.\nI\u2019ve spent about 9 years in Indiana.  Every state has things that make it unique. What makes Indiana tick? Two things that matter in Indiana, Corn and Soybeans (and the ongoing governmental subsides that support the Farm Industry). Gun Control and Violence while important- do not make the cut. So in Indiana the guns will stay while funding to support people who need help will remain limited. North Indy, Carmel and Fishers will continue to invest in roads that will permit us to take our children to the schools where the parents believe that they are \u201csafe.\u201d  Good luck with that., 6 Hey Congress, is getting re-elected more important than doing what is right?\nWhat will you do when you have to choose? Do you think the voters will notice?, 6 Does anyone care that the shooter will be punished? Does anyone think that 17 counts of murder is a solution to anything? Does anyone think that militarized police surrounding a high school after the shooter has escaped and making children march like prisoners of war makes us safer?\nI think what people care about is finding a way to not have this happen ever again. Other countries have solved this problem without creating a political war because for most countries the lives and safety of their children are of paramount importance. But obviously that is not true here. We have many other issues that are more important than the safety of our children. Will the people who control our media and our government ever let us out of the mental box that we are in and let our human instincts for protecting our children have effect? How many decades or centuries of this destruction of children will the American people shrug off before the obvious solutions are taken up?\nThe answer my friend, is blowing in the smoke filled wind. , 6 I wish I could be optimistic that we had come to a critical point in our debate on gun safety in a nation that the FBI estimates that there are 350 million guns. But as of now, I am not. Mind you I was a state health officer in a state which introduced two words into the national debate: Sandy Hook. As a public health physician I still strongly feel it is a priority, but with the current administration and the power of the NRA, I doubt there will be a groundswell. We can't even fund the Centers of Disease Control to study the issue, get members of Congress to remember that they were going to outlaw bump stocks or stop the use of all assault rifles like the AR-15 (used in Florida) or AK-47. I am not anti- Second Amendment but know you don't need a long gun that fires 6 shots per second to hunt or target practice.  In Texas where I live now, I remember the debate about letting students take guns to the University of Texas classes. (they can't) Texas is an open carry state.\nAfter the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world woke up to the power of nuclear weapons and subsequent actions diminished their use again. Perhaps we have not had our Hiroshima and Nagasaki moment. , 6 Another horrific senseless tragic shooting in the US, this time in Parkland Florida. I look out my office building and see once again the American flag placed at half-mast at our local Post Office.  When will these shootings stop ? Are we, as Americans, that uncivilized ?  Germany, UK, Australia and Japan all have stringent gun laws.  The German gun homicide rate is 0.05 per 1,000 people compared to 3.34 in the US. The UK has one of the lowest rates of gun homicides in the world, .05 per 100,000 people.  Since their gun reform law in 1996, Australia has not had any mass shootings. Their gun homicide rate has fallen from 1.6 per 100,000 people to 1.0. Japan reported six (6) gun homicides in 2014, when their population was 127 million.\nWe must come up with some sort of gun control program. But will it happen ?\nI implore our government to ban AR-15's. That would be a big step in the right direction., 6 From Trump on down, the GOP and all gun industry enablers are responsible for this ongoing carnage. They have abdicated their sworn duty to defend us. They have sold us out for money and power., 6 I grew up on the farm and I love rural America, but I am tired of being ruled by a minority because a serious mistake made in framing the Constitution allocates two senators and at least one representative to each state,regardless of population. That\u2019s why lunatics control the government and nothing sensible can be accomplished. , 6 Once again we are faced with a mass shooting in one of our high schools and once again NO new gun control laws will be enacted.  This is the norm in this country and we are past the point where anything can be done to stop it.  There is simply too much money to be made arming the American public with expensive firearms and ammunition.  The arms merchants own congress lock, stock, and barrel and it is obvious that their bottom lines matter more than the collateral damage created by a bunch of dead children.\n\nAnd if we think all this is bad wait and see what happens if congress actually passes the proposed legislation that would make carry permits reciprocal in the same manner that any one state's drivers licenses currently allow us to legally drive in all fifty states.  Some one with a carry permit from say Idaho could carry a concealed weapon in a place like New York City or better yet Washington DC.  Time for law enforcement officials to stand up and say NO!, 6 I consult inside of schools in the area, and was at a suburban school when they ran an \"active shooter\" drill. A special alarm went off and we were directed to gather on the floor near the doorway so that we could not be seen from the hallway, while the teacher locked the door. \n\nIt was a surreal experience. In the 5 years since I left the classroom, I couldn't believe that we now have drills for this. , 6 \nNo parent should ever have to wonder or worry or fear if when they say good-bye to their child when leaving for school, a movie, a concert, a nightclub, will they see their child return home in the afternoon or evening.\n\nEvery time a shooting occurs in this country, the mental anguish, trauma and anxiety in all parents and kids increases exponentially.  I finally realize the thinking behind the homeschooling concept parents I know subscribe to.  At least that's one environment they can control in keeping their kids safe and close at home., 6 Once again, I am horrified -- as a parent and a loving individual.\n\nBut the root of this is deeper than the NRA. It's really about money in politics. We will never address gun control -- just as we will not address a plethora of other issues -- as long as wealthy organizations and individuals can buy influence., 6 Apparently Americans think the trade off of gun deaths is worth it for the freedom to own, stockpile, and use guns however they see fit.  How can you expect us to have sympathy for them? This is what Americans chose for themselves and these kids are just the collateral damage. If Americans did not want things like this to happen, they would do something about guns.  , 6 If someone tells you that this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue, ask them:\n\n\"So you believe people with mental health issues should be restricted from owning a gun?\"\n\nIf they say yes - congratulate them - he or she is on the way to becoming an advocate for sensible gun control. See? Not so bad!\n\nIf they somehow say no, ask them:\n\n\"So for which public programs do you and your congressman support increasing funding to help identify and treat mental illness?\"\n\nIf they say yes - congratulate them - they are on the way to supporting bigger government and regulation.\n\nIf they say no (!?), you can safely tell them that the issue is really THEM., 6 Remind me how, exactly, individual gun ownership is still \"necessary to the security of a free State\"?  It protects the option of armed uprising?  Then why do Republicans support the militarization of police, ensuring that any such uprising can be suppressed?  , 6 I am a British citizen. Like nearly everyone outside the US, and many inside the US, I see these massacres happening on a frequent basis and feel incredulity and sadness in equal measure.\n\nIf the argument about the right to bear arms boils down to the right to defend one's self, then surely the answer in response must be - there are circa 33,000 deaths per year in the USA caused by guns. But how many lives per year are saved by people exercising their right to bear arms ? I suspect there is almost no comparison.      , 6 Publish a list of every single family who has an NRA member in that town, and especially the names of those who have assault weapons.\n\nThe laws won\u2019t change, but maybe public shaming of those who contribute to the problem by buying these weapons will be enough to make them relinquish these weapons of war. \n\nBTW there are virtually zero differences between civilian and military AR-15s, contrary to popular belief US military standard issue rifles are not fully automatic. , 6 At no period in American history before now would our leaders have stood by and allowed this to happen without answer, ESPECIALLY the founders and writers of the 2nd Amendment.  They were were not only just men of wisdom and deliberation but also of action.\n\nHiding behind the \"dignity\" of first responders and spouting platitudes is the absolute depth of cowardice.  Today I question the very manhood (yes, specifically the men) of our leaders.  No generation before this one would have let this pass.  Do we really think the the 82nd Airborne was filled with guys thinking they were fighting for a vision of liberty that necessitated armed teachers, pastors, theater ushers and more?  \n\nI've no problem with guns.  Like many Americans I grew up in farm country, around guns all of the time and shooting for game and sport.  My Dad is an accomplished hunter and was in the Army.  He taught me to shoot and is probably better from 50 yards with a bow and arrow than most NRA tough guys might be from half that distance with a scope.  Whatever they might have once done to promote freedoms and responsibility around gun ownership is completely lost.  Bin Laden himself could not have hoped to unleash more existential dread and fear on Americans than their disgraceful lack of leadership on this issue has emboldened.\n\nThis is a national security issue.  Children are DEAD.  What are you going to do Mr. President?  What are you going to do Congress?  What are we all going to do? , 6 Let it be known that in February, Trump signed a bill into law that rolled back an important regulation from the Barack Obama Presidency that made it more difficult for individuals with mental illnesses to buy a gun. It was done quietly by Mr. Trump, and we were all likely focusing on his umpteenth distraction.\nIt was noted as well that during his public statement on the shooting, he never once mentioned the word gun., 6 Yes, Mr. Sheriff, there Are words....words which rational people choose to ignore and those words are that we as a nation, support this kind of massacre daily. This has become who we are as a country. This is the face of our corrupted democracy. We have built a nation where our children are not safe in their schools, where no one is safe when people walk the streets with automatic weapons as in  Charlottesville recently, when proud gun owners can even sport their weapons openly in restaurants and yes, even in schools where I'm from with no one seeming to care (I dared not confront the parent when I saw the gun in his holster while waiting with my daughter to get her textbooks). What about our rights to the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness? When politicians wring their hands and say prayers for the victims, let them then simply look at the data and take action. As the NYTimes reported months ago, the number of gun massacres is strongly correlated with the number of guns in the population. The US is off the charts when it comes to guns and murders per capital compared to any other industrialized country. The solution is not rocket science, as Australia's successful actions to reduce such massacres demonstrated. Until there is a political party willing to act, this tragedy and others like it will remain a trademark of the American way of life., 6 Suggestion: cellphones sold to students/children in the US should come pre-loaded with a text message saying goodbye to their parents and expressing their love. Not all children will have time to compose and type one themselves when it comes time for their school to experience a mass slaughter.\n\nIt's not much, but it's better for their parents to get a form letter good-bye from their children rather than nothing before their deaths., 6 Are schools becoming defacto mausoleums in our culture today? At one point do we as the society turn and face the collective darkness we have created, a cultural context that is beyond our current politics of blame, the reach of reasoned legislation and the empty mantra of \"American greatness\". Do we have the psychological courage to look at our own collective \"shadow\" associated with violence?, 6 Other news media CNN and BBC (but not yet the NYT) are reporting that the FBI may have been alerted abou Cruz several months before this incident. It appears as though this tragedy might have been prevented if the individual who was concerned about Cruz's postings made sure the FBI was properly alerted. More importantly, did the FBI forward this information to local law enforcement? Banning these assault weapons will help in the future but might also have the effect of driving them to the underground black market where they can't be traced. So, like it or not, these things are probably going to be around a lot longer than we would want them to be. So, please remember, \"If you see something-say something.\" The more we learn about this case, the more we learn that warning signs were out there.  , 6 Recently, the Westchester County Executive and members of the Board of Legislators approved legislation banning gun shows at the Westchester County Center - a government owned building. The recent  horrificFlorida gun shooting which killed innocent children  highlights the need for all governments -at every level - to do the same. NYS should ban gun shows in government own buildings -just like Westchester did. The annual Albany gun show is held at the Empire State Plaza Convention Center in Albany each January --one of NY State's most prestigious owned government buildings.\nIf people want to purchase guns they should purchase them at private locations. Government buildings should not be used for that purpose.\nPAUL FEINER\nGreenburgh, NY Town Supervisor\nAlbany Gun Show 2018\n20 Jan 2018 - 21 Jan 2018\nThe event is over\nEmpire State Plaza Convention Center , 6 I have come to the determination that life to lose a young life at the barrel of a gun is now considered the price one pays to be a 'free' American. Young men and women die by the thousands in needless losing foreign wars-but there is no public outcry. Instead, military spending continues to soar. Gun violence is now the norm, but there is no effort to pass any form of legislation to deal with it. Mass shootings are now a monthly event, but soon this one will be old news and life will go on as usual. I was sure after the massacre of the innocents at Sandy Hook things would change. In any other developed country they would have. But not in America. The NRA and other gun lobby groups are not to blame, they have a right to voice their opinion. Apparently, their is just not enough political or financial will amongst Americans to give opposing organisations a loud enough voice to counter the NRA's arguments. Americans have the power to change American society and the world for the better, and have done so on countless occasions. The 'unexpected' election of President Trump is a recent example of how Americans can evoke change if enough want it. Apparently, however, Americans must be decided that the price of freedom to own and use any type of firearms must be paid in the blood. Sadly, it appears most Americans are willing to pay that price., 6 I'll bet Trump is going to Parkland, FL and that his remarks will not mention firearms at all.  The reason that I'm so sure that he's indeed going (since we normally can't believe anything he says) is that Mar-a-Lago is 41.7 miles away by car (per Google Maps; clearly shorter by helicopter).  \"Let's see, if I do the tour and then give remarks so it all wraps up by 10 am, I can still get in 36 holes that day before it gets dark...\"  If that sounds pessimistic and crass, we'll if the size 12 golf shoe fits..., 6 I am simply numb.  I watched some of the coverage, but I know the response will be the same from our representatives.  They'll talk about praying for the victims, but they'll DO NOTHING.  And it will turn out that there were plenty of warning flags, but of course no one actually stopped the shooter.  There's really no point watching this terrible circus.  I'm switching back to the Olympics. , 6 I am so puzzled by comments that suggest seeing headlines like these is becoming so easy, or that we, as a country, are becoming numb to these events. I can not disagree more. I am continually horrified and that feeling is compounded with every subsequent shooting. All this blood is on the hands of every congress person that has taken money from the NRA and won't institute sense gun control. It's on the hands of every member of the NRA that has not stood up and said enough is enough and canceled their membership. It's disgraceful that as country we can't and won't protect our children., 6 Another gun free zone...  When will liberals learn?  When you need help, who do you call?  Someone with a gun.   So simple its stupid.  , 6  My theory is, that because we are group animals, give and take between individual and group is a fact of life. Being the imaginative animal, we can conceptualize these energy flows in a variety of ways. We can directly live together, feed each other, hold each other as we are born and die, or we can abstract this energy into social customs that involve transfers of goods and/or money. Death and taxes, as they say. So we can pay personal taxes in the form of stricter gun laws, or we can pay social taxes in the form of random gun deaths. This, too, is our choice., 6 Gutless , gutless Congress. Misinterpreting the 2nd amendment is no excuse. Allow only muskets to be owned by civilians and even that is a stretch. \n\nThere have been one million US civilian deaths by guns in the last 30 yrs. Almost more than all US military deaths since the war of Independence. Can not the gutless Congress pass a law that will end the possession of guns to take effect in 12 yrs ie. after most of these useless people are gone from DC ?\n\nGutless , gutless useless Congress mostly Republicans., 6 Below is a list of sold their souls NRA funded members of Congress, who enable this slaughter.  If your rep is on this list, please do call their office and tell them to stop their faux concern for mental health.  \n\nOther countries have dysfunctional angry teenage boys too, but they do not have the ongoing terrorism of school shootings.  \n\nThis is not about mental health, it is about guns.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/nra-donations/?utm_term...\n\nNote that if you don't want to keep referring to this list, just vote against all Republicans., 6 There are only two reasons why someone would want to own an assault rifle with extended magazines. Either they think they may actually need a weapon that can kill a lot of people quickly, or they want to play with it as a thrill toy. In both cases, by their own definition, they have disqualified themselves from owning the firearm on the basis of mental incompetence. Bottom line is no member of the general public should be allowed to have an assault rifle with extended magazines. The Republican Congress has repeatedly failed to act to prohibit ownership of an assault rifle. This in the face of absolute evidence that the weapon will continue to be used for public slaughter. There is blood today on the hands of every Republican Congressman, and we all know there will be more blood tomorrow. Call them out, now. , 6 USA-\n- 'land of the free and the home of the brave',\n- All men are created equal with unalienable rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness given to all humans by their creator.\n-Give me your tired, your poor....\nThese were the values upon which this country was founded.\nBut with the cowards in the congress who are failing to act just because they are beholden to the NRA, with the president and certain conservative lawmakers who spew hatred against different groups and prey on the fears of the people, I am sure the founding fathers are turning in their graves.\nUSA-'shining city on the hill'- Other countries are laughing at our stupidity and lack of common sense measures., 6 Gun advocates simply say add more security to schools, hire more police to patrol schools and arm teachers and school administrators. This does not fix the problem. We need stricter gun access. Why do we need an assault rifle to be legal in the US? An analogy for all of this debate is a poorly controlled diabetic whose doctor simply just increases the patient's diabetic medication every time the sugar levels are poorly controlled. This really does not fix the root of the problem of the poorly controlled diabetes. How about diet and exercise? We need long term solutions, not short term., 6 One school parent put it perfectly in response to Marco Rubio's parroting: It's not too early to talk about gun control, it's too late.  , 6 This nation is a sponsor of terrorism.  Why?  Because it permits practically anyone who can breathe to own weapons of mass destruction.  \n\nI feel sad for the parents who lost their children in this massacre, but the truth is, America doesn't care about its children.  Gun ownership and greed are at the top of the priority list.  By the statistics, we just need to get used to this type of thing going on until we decide to change our priorities.  Because &lt;b&gt; nothing is going to change &lt;/b&gt; until our system changes.\n\nSo I feel sad about this latest tragedy.  But I don't feel sad for America.  This is what Americans want - they want a system that allows this carnage to continue.  Plain and simple.   Every other civilized nation in the world does it differently, and they are better off. \n\nOnly America is the land of the stupid and the home of the free to kill., 6 Students and teachers knew this guy was going to snap one day. He was expelled because of behavior problems.  A guy saw a disturbing post by Nikolas Cruz on YouTube and reported it to them and the FBI who claims they couldn't find Nikolas Cruz.  Didn't they ever hear of google???  I'd love to hear how they ALL dropped the ball on this.  Why didn't the school provide mental health support?  This isn't an inner city school, it's in an upper middle class suburb.  Many of the students knew about him, and so must the adults at the school.  Why was no action taken????  This isn't about gun control.  It's about people whose mental health problems are not addressed and who get tossed like a hot potato to someone else to deal with.  Another epic fail., 6 I am furious and nauseous beyond belief, and have been since the news started coming out yesterday.  I have called both of my representative's (Randy Hultgren R-IL) numbers and lambasted his failure to do anything, laying the blood of these innocents directly at his and his obstructionist colleague's feet (with only one minor expletive).  I am sick unto death with \"2nd Amendment rights\".  This amendment is an anachronism suited for the 18th century, not the 21st, and to argue otherwise is completely specious.  \n\nThe \"2nd amenders\" often state the Tree of Liberty must be nurtured with the blood of patriots, but I only see the blood of innocent victims--elementary school children, concert goers, people celebrating a weekend night, students in class pursuing their life's dream, parishioners in their churches--as the ones whose blood is being spilled on this infamous tree's roots.\n\nThis has got to stop.  No one else should have to join mu associate Patrick's group of survivors (a victim of the Northern Illinois University shooting 10 years ago), nor leave only survivors to mourn their deaths.  Enough already., 6 Republicans will tell you that their right to own a AK47 or AR15 outweighs you or your children's right to live., 6 NO more talk about GOD!!!! GOD has nothing to do with this, she will provide no  solutions and no salvations.  Mass shootings in the United States ate the responsibility of LAWFUL gun owners to address. Like children, the NRA and its members demand their rights and reject all responsibility.  NRA members need to take responsibility for gun culture in this country and change it!! We need safety and security but gun owners provide us with neither.  Put on your big girl pants NRA members, take control of your organization, and take control of gun culture in this country.  , 6 It's well past time to repeal the Second Amendment.  The rapid fire (you will excuse the alliteration) nature of these shootings, now more than two dozen in number in the first 46 days into 2018 is telling us that the Second Amendment, while logical for the 18th century, is counterintuitive in the 21st century.  The right to own and use firearms should have to be earned, not just blithely granted as a threshold matter and incrementally taken away only after bad things have already happened.  No other civilized country on earth has such a laissez faire attitude toward such a lethal weapon because the hazards and negatives of such a policy so demonstrably and completely outweigh any positives.  We don't need any more involuntary martyrs to this quasi-religious belief about firearms.  Repealing the Second Amendment can't and won't and shouldn't end citizen ownership of firearms.  But doing so should not have as a starting point the mere fact of being alive.  Events like Parkland are telling us we have it wrong.  Treating the Second Amendment as religion only prevents us from responding in a logical way. Repeal the damn thing and start over., 6 Gracious when will anyone's life matter over profit? I'm not alone to ask a rhetorical question. Whomever manufactures assault weapons goes to sleep tonight to return to work tomorrow and on and on: how and why do you? Are you trapped in the industrial wheel? \n\nThe NRA reminds me of every professional body that oversees the this and the that. I consider my own professional memberships for which cost too much and more every year to belong to. The difference between the organizations where I am a member and the NRA is to ask how many mass shooters in recent weeks are members of the NRA? Or, does the answer to that question matter less than the 10% of gun sales contribution to the NRA? , 6 Willing to bet that he and most of these shooters were on anti-depressants of some kind., 6 Enough is enough! I am heartbroken mother of four children. How can these tragedies continue to happen? I am extremely angry! There has been no action from our Government leaders to change gun laws or to aid/fund mental health problem. Majority of Americans want stricter gun control!!! Also most Americans want to solve the mental health problem!!!!! Listen to the people who elected you!!!!! Mothers of the America, rise up and demand change of gun laws AND real mental health reform!!! NO MORE! , 6 Computer chips in PCs, phones, Fit-Bits, hellfire missiles, bicycles, satellites,\nheart monitors, car-keys, credit cards, a driver's license, passports, planes, trains, automobiles, airport screening machines, kitchen appliances, Alexa and \"home pods,\" and just about everything else. And yet an embedded computer-chip in every weapon-produced isn't possible? People wonder why U.S. products cannot compete with China, a place where they have handgun safety, laws and control??? Oh so 19th century and regressing quickly along with infrastructure, education, and a bought-and-paid-for political class. Oil and weapons; the great marketing and sales' hopes of western societies' foundations have returns-on-investment based on death and destruction. Over here, many say the U.S.'s strength and power is born out of relative youth, still yet too historically immature to know where to concentrate its energies constructively within the world-of-nations. And so comes the youth Nikolas Cruz, doing only what the society he lives in teaches him to do. Had he a scope or better perspective, he could have seen further....much further than Jeff Sessions, who wants to study \" the intersection of mental health and criminality and violence.\" That wouldn't be too difficult would he look in the mirror and review his pre-Attorney General campaign contributors, which dealt almost exclusively in death and destruction.\nIs there a civics' chip? Or at least a computer chip in every manufactured weapon?, 6 And BUSINESSMAN Donald Trump insists that ALL of America's crime problems will come from SOUTH of the Texas/Mexico border.    Shows just how \"out of touch\" Donald is, with his \"own people\".  The person, who executed this crime was NOT an illegal alien.  They are/were American!   How much more proof do we need, to understand just how UN-qualified Donald is, for Executive Office?    Latino's are NOT THE PROBLEM.  Ignorance, bigotry, racism, and other, equally EVIL, vices are the REAL problem, in America.  , 6 To all those politicians and elected officials (generally republicans) who are blindly and totally subservient to the NRA gun lobby. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to pay a price, do you, because that blind subservience buys you elections, doesn\u2019t it? \n\nAnd to the NRA, you don\u2019t have to pay a price either do you, because all you care about is selling more and more guns to increase your bottom line. \n\nIt\u2019s about time for people to ask, just who is responsible here? Who owns this? I suggest it\u2019s that gun lobby, and those politicians who refuse to do anything about reasonable gun control laws. It\u2019s time to look really hard into your own mirrors.   \n\nIt\u2019s assault type guns that have killed all those people, NOT mental illness, nothing else., 6 I write mostly as therapy because I feel powerless. I will never understand how Trump and his adherents can claim the infamous border wall is critical to ensure the safety of Americans while refusing to even acknowledge the homegrown carnage resulting from gun use in this country. To describe the current state of affairs as \"sad\" is a gross understatement., 6 The US as we know it is clear: the right to have any and all guns completely unfettered by any restriction wins over our children's, and anyone else's lives. Maybe it IS time to revisit secession, peaceful of course, so that those of us who would like a modicum of regulation to protect us from this insanity as well as pollution and other corporate avarice in the name of profit, can live that way and the other half can descend further into the hell of their own making.  And the resulting (continuing) weakening of the US as a global power may well be a good thing, since protecting us from other oligarchies seems no longer  in the works. Yes, a lot of people would have to move one way or the other.  Just food for thought., 6 'Trump\u2019s Budget Cuts Millions Of Dollars From Gun Background Check System.\n...\nBuried on Page 719 of his\u00a0fiscal year 2019 budget, released Monday,\u00a0the president calls for cuts to the National Criminal Records History Improvement Program and the NICS Act Record Improvement Program.

Trump\u2019s budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 would slash their funding to $61 million, which amounts to a 16 percent cut.\"\n-- Huffington Post, 6 This young man was expelled - given no help with his problems - then he's alone in the world when his mother dies - are we surprised that he exploded into this?\n\nAs a 40 year ER nurse I remember when disturbed people had help - before Reagan cancelled most of those services.  Now teachers are telling me the disturbed kids are in regular classes - making it impossible for them to teach the wide range of students or serve the ones with special needs.\n\nAt least the stock market is doing well., 6 Emotionally off male teens/young adults like CA's Eliot Rodger, CT's Adam Lanza, & FL's Nikolas Cruz were missing engaged dads in their daily household lives - Rodger's & Lanza's dads were divorced from the custodial moms, while Cruz' adoptive dad died a few years ago.\nI wonder too about how engaged even physically present, custodial dads were to other mass shooters - did these dads (who may be workaholics/alcoholics/whatevers themselves) inadvertently set bad examples, by introducing these boys to recreational/self-defense/hunting firearms to \"boost these boys' masculine self-esteem\", w/o really understanding how bullied, isolated, & unhinged these boys were becoming . . . as the boys were retreating into violent artwork & videogames, social media rants, etc.?\nWhen originally well-meaning dads basically leave - whether through divorce, death, or just not being as engaged as they should be in their sons' lives - the overwhelmed custodial mom is left desperately relying on the police, the doctors, the schools, & others to help her in the complex war to instill sanity into their sons' lives.\nMandatory genetic counseling, plus parenting classes during every planned child's key life stage (pre-conception, infancy, toddler, elementary, puberty, young adult) & free birth control for all (unplanned, in utero-damaged or addiction/mental illness gene-carrying kids = overwhelmed birth & adoptive parents) cld help prevent mental health-based, gun-enabled crimes., 6 And Trump wants to spend millions on a parade?!  If he won't get rid of AR-15 guns (which, apparently, the NRA feels is every teenager's right to own and use), then maybe Trump could take the money he wants to use for his wall and the parade and put it into mental health programs for schools?  , 6 Where did he learn to shoot? See the list of grants @ https://www.nrafoundation.org/media/2082/16nrafannualreportweb1.pdf to see one record of the NRA support for the shooting program of that high school's JROTC, whose uniform the killer was wearing. , 6 Let's place a portion of the blame where credit is due: the NRA, who has never met a meaningful gun-control law they can abide. Having transformed themselves over the last 40 years from a honorable organization advocating sport hunting and gun safety, it is now a scary mafia promulgating insane gun laws and fostering anti-government rhetoric in the name of 2nd Amendment so-called \"rights\". With coffers full of cash, their lobbyists constitute one of the most powerful, and feared, on Capital Hill. Think that the concerns from parents and loved ones of those lost in this tragedy will override efforts by the NRA? From Columbine? From Sandy Hill Elementary? Wishful thinking.\n\nWhile the roots of this, and other shootings, are indeed multifaceted, the proliferation of guns in our society is a clearly a critical factor. So thanks be to you, Mr. Wayne LaPierre and your NRA toadies, for your part in another \"successful\" massacre. And rest assured, there will be more., 6 Watching something like this happen is hopefully an eye opener for us and our leaders in congress. Some of these situations can be prevented if we would set aside our differences and do what's right. I understand guns and know some are needed for protection and hunting, however they are to easy to get, especially more deadly ones like the one used. Right now we just need to pray for those individuals and their families. We as a country need to stand by each other and protect one another. This kind of violence needs to be stopped or prevented. Our prayers should be directed towards the victims, but also the individual who committed these murders. We should honor the 17 children who did not fully live their beautiful lives in which they deserve. , 6 \"Bloody hands Trump,\" our Liar in Chief, once again favors his big money NRA donors over the American people he vowed to protect.  The Republican fools who kowtow down to the NRA are complicit.  They too have bloody hands., 6 From another NY Times article today:\n\n\"Mr. Cruz described him as a \u201ctroubled kid\u201d who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals...\"\n\nIt is virtually guaranteed, that a person who kills animals, will go on to harm humans; this is a \"red flag\" warning that is given way too little attention.  No one who is known to harm animals, should ever be allowed to purchase or own any kind of firearm.\n\nThe fact that he \"bragged\" about it, tells you everything - a dangerous sociopath was supplied with a high speed killing tool.  The AR15 was not the primary problem, but common sense requires that its distribution be sharply curtailed - that is the \"2nd Amendment\" piece of the problem.\n\nThe \"1st amendment\" piece of the problem, is the way the press handles these events - the focus on the criminal makes him into some kind of notorious \"anti-hero\" who other criminals, for some reason no normal person can comprehend, want to imitate.  The press should be very careful not to make the criminal into someone who is \"interesting\" or seen as holding power over other people.\n\nComplex problems require complex solutions; everyone has to be willing to compromise and pitch in, as opposed to pointing fingers at other people., 6 All this, and now the NRA is bullying Congress to pass a law that lets those from states with conceal and carry to be allowed to do so in states that don't permit this. Those of us for sensible gun control legislation need to band together and create the antidote to the NRA. Until we get that dirty money out of Congress, we'll continue to have incidents like these increasing at an ever increasing rate., 6 Trump \u201claments terrible violence,\u201d but avoids mention of gun control.\n\nHow predictable, right down to the adjective., 6 We need to steer the conversation towards discussion of our 1st Amendment rights being infringed upon.  We should all be Free to Assemble without a well-founded fear of being gunned down by a mass murderer.  So long as we continue to allow regular citizens to be unlimited ammo, weaponry (some of which is military-style), and related accessories (bumpstocks, gas masks, bullet-proof vests, etc.), and with NO questions asked, then American citizens will continue to have a Well-founded Fear every time they step foot in a school, a shopping mall, a movie theater, a concert hall, an outdoor fair or concert, a church, etc.\n\nWhat about OUR 1st Amendment rights?! , 6 After Newtown, CT, I thought something would change.  Nothing did.  I know now, too, nothing will.  , 6 OUR government is not a democracy. 9 out of ten Americans want weapons of war banned from our streets but our elected officials will never vote to remove them. The money they get from the NRA is too sweet to pass up., 6 Americans, rise up, stop supporting NRA, stop electing Republican and Democrat politicians who are in NRA's pocket, who are not supporting assault weapon bans, background checks, a waiting period before purchase, bullet registration and countless other possible sensible licenses and restrictions for gun and rifle ownership for only those who are mentally stable, for hunting and practicing. The rest of the world, Australia, UK, EU accomplished this, why not \"the greatest country in the world\" so that children are not slaughtered in schools, movie houses, churches, concerts? These weapons of war do not belong in stores! Stop using and abusing the 2nd amendment which was added on December 15, 1791 because the federal government had no standing military ! We have a powerful army! There is no need for a self declared militias, we have an army and police force in place. The 2018 defense budget authorizes just under $700 billion in defense spending. , 6 Please Mr. Trump, no more of your canned (not written by you) speeches. Fix the issue: assault weapons in the hands of the mentally unwell., 6 here is another angry boy- who didn't want to admit that life is not a video game, and there are consequences for your actions in life. where were his parents?  who were his teachers? How did he escape notice? , 6 Ban assault style weapons.    Increase spending for mental health issues.   Social media sites become part of backround checks.     These measures would reduce gun deaths.     We must vote for politicians who agree with this., 6 Fire Drills, earthquake drills--I can understand.  But lock down drills?  Only in the US!  It's the new normal-- so sad!, 6 Assault riffles are military weapons designed to do just one thing, kill as quickly and efficiently as possible. As such they should be restricted to only the well regulated militia referred to in the Bill of Right., 6 This will happen again and yet again. Parents will loose their beloved children to another lunatic that thinks others are to blame for what ever grievense, or slight, is imagined. Politicians won't change anything as it might stop them being realected.  The world looks on in total amazement at American gun laws.\nIt's time to stop the murders and totally outlaw gun possession in this country.\nAlas, this will never happen here, people risk their lives every time they leave their homes.  Kiss your children when they leave for school, you may never see them again except at the morgue to identify them. , 6 During horrific times such as these it is absolutely important/help-full to know what was said by One who has-done/does Miracles all over the world:\n\n\"Birth is a terminal illness.\"\n     \"Death is like changing your clothes.\"\n     \"Every-One has so many lifetimes that they cannot count           them.\"\n     \"Every-One is walking on their own path . . . at their           own pace . . . and, according to their own light\n      -- and, every-One will reach the goal . . . sooner or           later.\", 6 Back in the day when this country was born people like Thomas Jefferson believed there was a threat that a gun could remedy. The threat was that the British would try to take over the country again. That was the reason for gun ownership. Americans would be ready to form a militia that could defend against that. \n\nThat was then. Explain to me why gun ownership is so important today. , 6 I know that the political response to this tragedy is going to be the same as it always is (\"there is no law that could have prevented this!\"). But I think the following deserves repeating anyway: gun control laws are NOT just about prevention and deterrence. Obviously, those things are important but that is not their sole purpose. Laws are also, necessarily even, a reflection of what society says is acceptable...and what it says against reprehensible. Do laws condemning rape stop all rapes? Does having a drinking at 21 prevent all people under 21 from drinking? Do bans on illicit drugs stop all trade in the drug market? Clearly not...but that's not entirely point is it? \n\nI refuse to believe that we as a country are so far gone that we cannot move the needle even a tiny bit in the direction of societal protection from those who think it is their \"right\" to legally own weapons capable of mass destruction. Yes, yes, I know...\"but what about the Second Amendment?\" And yes, yes, I know...\"but I use my assault rifle for harmless recreation.\" Sorry, but that's the easy way out. \n\nThe better question is, what about the Fourteenth Amendment? And at what point will we, as a society, finally say that our collective right to life should outweigh a individual's right to own a weapon that, in turn, gives them the power to take out their whole neighborhood?, 6 This has to be something that  is being and has long been discussed in schools by students, their teachers and administrators. Every one of those students can go on to vote if they don't already. Perhaps this is the population that can finally make the pols hear. Who can organize this specific organization. AFT? PTA? Student societies?, 6 Smaller magazines = less deaths per minute.\nCan't we simply start there? \n\nBumper stocks? Who needs that? - it's like a radar transmitter with the intent to circumvent the law.\n\nWhen will America care about something besides profit, which seems to fall short of creating happiness anyway?\n\nSo NRA, you keep buying your politicians because soon enough We the People will vote them out and you can hire them as lobbyists to regain your influence on DC. Good luck with that. This will be a major issue in the midterms, creating yet another Catch 22 for one party, anyway., 6 Permit me to make a modest proposal: No high school diploma, no guns. It\u2019s a pretty low bar, I admit. But if you don\u2019t have the maturity, stability, or \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 intelligence to graduate from high school, you have no business having a pellet gun, much less an assault rifle. Making people wait until they\u2019re 21 to own a gun or buy ammunition would surely make sense too. , 6 President* Trump is a coward.\n\nGOP Congressmen who have taken NRA money are also cowards, hypocrites, and complicit.\n\nThis is not about the 2nd Amendment. This is about common sense concern for the future of our society. \n\nLegislators have a moral and ethical duty to their constituents, and our Republic at large.\n\nShame on every one of them who've taken NRA money, but not fought to allow the CDC to study the effects of gun violence.\n\nCongress needs to authorize the CDC to resume research on gun violence NOW.\n\nThen, repeal Citizens United and get NRA and corporate money out of our politics.\n\nShame on President* Trump, shame on the GOP, shame on the NRA, and shame on Chief Justice John Roberts. , 6 My condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nWe all know nothing will change and these massacres will continue regularly. Moving on, let's await the next one next week. In time even the soul gets callused when there is no hope whatsoever.\n\nHug your children before your town and school become the next statistic., 6 At this point, I basically treat \"17 killed in school shooting\" the same as \"17 killed in bus accident\". It's sad, but not remotely shocking: it's become the sort of thing that you expect to happen every so often. These are just routine tragedies now., 6 Australia enacted strict gun control laws after its first mass shooting. It hasn't had another one since. DUH!, 6 Why do you allow this to continue?, 6 Trumps comments about school safety are empty. He is just saying what he has to say. He supports the NRA which is in my opinion turned into a domestic terrorist organzation that controls all the leglsaltors with money.\n\nTrump's idea of safety is more guns.\n\nThe problem is the NRA and we need legislation on guns. The GOP is the Gun party. Any words from them are hollow, they are liars. Trump needs to go, the GOP needs to clean itself of all the corrupt legislators before gun control can really take place otherwise any gun control initiatives will be stopped by these corrupt and baseless people., 6 What a surprise that this happened again!  I guess the prayers from the last mass-shooting were not enough.  Let's all pray harder this time.  And, yes, let's also make it easier to buy more guns, semiautomatic assault rifles, bump stocks, and ammunition.  All of these actions should definitely help prevent another mass-shooting.  I hope I am not missing important anything., 6 These were our babies.  These were our kids.  These were our children who we let die.  \n\nAnd what do we say to say this?  That the perpetrator was broken.  \n\nBut what of the gun?  The gun was fine.  The gun was flawless.  It was purpose-built to kill, and it did just that.  17 of our children are now dead.  \n\nTo be clear, the issue is the gun.   , 6 Dirty money from the NRA  to Gov. Scott and to Mark Rubio, 17 souls are your responsibility....... the spineless congress.........The crooked President who cares about money, cheating on his wife and not hiring Americans to work on his properties.. .... wanting to be a friend to RUSSIA  .this is beyond words !!!! Gov. Scott had a hard time looking at the camera last night, did you notice?? And  Scott had a lot of trouble answering questions. He should be ashamed of himself.   Trump will say a few words, that are fed to him, and move on..... Obama would be in Florida. What a mess this country is in....and again thank you to the ELECTORIAL COLLEGE! Maybe you got a little money too???     , 6 The venal cowards who run this country and are in thrall to the NRA and other special interests have innocent blood on their hands.\n\nAgain.\n\nThis is all on them., 6 Thoughts and Prayers, yada yada yada,\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nThe NRA\n\nSo Sad :-(, 6 You can ban THIS gun, but they will get it illegally, or they will get others.  I'd actually like to see all caring people start to discuss the underlying causes like violence in video games, absent parents, violence in Hollywood movies made by left-wing do goodies, lax mental health laws etc etc. , 6 \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of firearm and ammunition sales in the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\"\n\nYeah, right., 6 Why does this not happen in Canada or Europe or Australia?, 6 I propose that rather than background checks, gun restrictions, that upon presentation by a trusted  person (teacher, doctor, police etc.), that they can file standard form, to the police, that would interdict gun sales for 60 days. The police would then produce a statement if this restriction should persist greater than 60 days.\nVSS, 6 This is a failure by the school administration and the police.  Cruz gave every indication that he was violent, and the authorities had many opportunities to intervene.  Was there no legal authority to remove firearms from the possession of a student, a minor, who is disciplined for violence?  A court order could have been obtained., 6 While we are pouring our hearts out with anger and grief over the latest mass murder of citizens by disturbed men armed with miliitary assault rifles, let us not forget the extent to which our own federal government, bullied by the NRA, is preventing public health agencies like the CDC and the NIH from researching this unprecedented public health menace., 6 i overheard part of a discussion in the workplace today about this. What caught my attention was one person, who I know is into firearms, saying that it \"always happens in schools, and one reason is obvious\": that teachers are not allowed to be armed. He then went on to note how the protocol has changed somewhat since Columbine, in that law enforcement's go-to strategy is no longer to wait until all is \"clear\" to enter a building and attempt interdiction.\n\nAnd I recall my disgust (and near nausea) at Wayne LaPierre's insistence that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. This remark is beginning to make sense, especially in light of the opposite view, which is that there are too many guns in this country. It's unequivocally true, there are. What's more upsetting: that genie is already out of the bottle. Or that shell has left its casing, whichever. I'd say at this point we have as much realistic chance of reducing the number of firearms in the U.S. as we do changing the Second Amendment into something that makes sense for the world as it is now. Ain't gunna happen.\n\nMy co-worker went on to say that if some teachers were armed and properly trained with firearms, AND THE ENTIRE SCHOOL KNEW THIS, no one would attempt things like what happened yesterday in Parkland.\n\nWhat really bothers me now is that, given all facets of our problem here, this argument is beginning to seem logical. And I'm one who who dislikes guns a great deal.\n\nheart-rending, 6 We had a law that was in effect written during the Clinton administration that banned assault weapons. Was it perfect? No. It expired after ten years and was not renewed by Congress. If it was possible then, it should be possible now. Seems to me that no one needs a weapon whose sole purpose is to kill many people in a short time without much effort. And here's an idea- TAX bullets - heavily- the country needs revenue !, 6 It seems like most mass shootings involve assault rifles purchased legally. Congress is full of cowards. They know full well what these modern assault rifles do (and it has nothing to do with hunting or self defense) but they choose to tolerate dead kids. Ok. Well what about some compromise? If the right to own assault rifles is god given, then what about \u201cenhanced\u201d background checks just for them, with \u201cnormal\u201d background checks for standard firearms? By enhanced, meaning a little more scrutiny - i.e. does this individual have wacko postings on social media? Pattern of deviant conduct, stalkings, violent law infractions of any kind just below what would disqualify someone for a handgun?\nCan we at least start a discussion there?? Otherwise I just give up. It\u2019s hopeless., 6 The Republicans believe that if we pray hard enough these events would never happen.  It is counterproductive to keep these fiends from buying fire arms.  After all every sportsman needs and AR-15!, 6 Attention Socially Conscious Lawmakers across America.\n\nIt is past time that you take on the NRA.  They are a small minority of people who are trying to stop effective gun control.  Stop with the baby steps.  Go for all of it.\n\nWE THE PEOPLE DEMAND that EVERY GUN in OUR United States of America be REGISTERED on a national database, state LICENSED and Fully INSURED for Liability.\n\nJust like cars.\n\nAttention gun owners:  WE do not want your guns.  WE want your guns to stop killing us and our loved ones.  NOW., 6 Since gun control is apparently never an option, they should make flak jackets a mandatory part of school uniforms., 6 I have been listening for wisdom and logic in the aftermath of this massacre. President Trump has made \"sophomoric\" remarks. While an actual H.S. Sophomore has said we need more \"gun control\" A friend reminded me of this:\n\"There is a profound meaning of the seventh line in the poem 'The Rainbow' by William Wordsworth. Actually in this line 'child is the father of man' the poet wants to say that man is the product of his habits and behaviour developed in the childhood. So, parents and teachers should try to give him good values because only a good man can make a better society.\"\nI can't wait for the high school kid to take over in the Congress., 6 The U.S. used to have a ban on the weapon used to kill these children; until spineless republicans overturned it.  They have a lot of Innocent blood on their hands. What sorry excuse for men., 6 It happened AGAIN yesterday. Another mass shooting, another 17 people dead. How many more \"thoughts and prayers\" are going to be offered? What is it going to take to stop the violence?\nAmericans have a terrifyingly short memory. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 30 mass shootings in 2018 so far. It's been 46 days.\nWe need a leader, someone to voice these atrocities. Someone to have the authority and use it to say enough is enough. Someone to address the nation and say we are going to stop this incessant violence, and by any means necessary. Whether it's the guns or bullets or mental health care or perpetrators or law enforcement or prevention or teachers or training, this has got to stop. The President of the United States should go on every broadcast TV station in the country today and say that we have had enough. He should be sobbing and apologetic and mad. And he should say he is redistributing resources - whatever it takes - to find answers. I cannot say it any more emphatically than this: Stop this violence. Donald J. Trump, you need to do this now.\nAnd U.S. reps, senators, state reps and city reps, you need to help. We all need to help., 6 This is sick, sad and insane.\n\nI am one person without much power or influence beyond my vote, which I intend to use... perhaps here in MO that won't count for much.\nAnd I will speak up, and try to influence people when and when I can... \n\nBut my reason for posting here is to leave a public record, that I knew our gun laws were insane. That I knew our politicians were mostly owned by the NRA. That I knew our president was unqualified and ignorant.\n\nI believe history will judge us harshly for what we've become.\nI want to add my voice, and be counted among those who recognized the horror as it engulfed us.\n\nGod help us... I pray it's not too late to turn it around., 6 I'm sick and tired of hearing \"Our thoughts and prayers are with ...\"  which has become an empty, meaningless cliche in the absence of action to control the carnage caused by semi-autopmatic weapons.  I'm sick and tired of watrching our  duplicious politicians pontificating with  their crocodile tears -- Yes, I'm talking about you Mr. President, Senator Marco Rubio and Florida Giovernor Scott who are and have been the recipients of \"blood money\" from the NRA, along with other members of the Republican Party who have systematically and consistently opposed any sensible measures to mitigate the carnage.  I'm a naturalized US citizen and for the first time in the 51 years I've been in this country I am ashamed to say I'm an American.   If it weren't for my 3 beautiful grandchildren and two children born here I would have left a long time ago because I'm also sick and tired of having to explain when I'm abroad why/how  the United States can elect a Treasonous Trump, deny universal health care to its citizens, uphold  the scurge of an archaic and absolete 2nd amendement rights that needs to be modified, if not abolished altogether, among many other negative  features of American society.\nNo, no more throughts and prayers, but rather political action, mass demonstrations, holding our politician's feet to the fire,  and exercising the power of the ballot in November.  , 6 Has the NRA been able to provide us any rationale as to why ANY private citizen should be able to Legally purchase an AR-15?  Have they given their reasoning behind whi someone like Stephen Paddock should have been able to Legally buy unlimited weaponry, ammo, and related accessories, with NO questions asked?\n\nWe need a National Database that records every single purchase of weaponry, ammo, and related accessories.  This includes items purchased online, at gun shows, at gun stores, and between individual buyers.  (And to say that this won't stop those who buy illegally, is besides the point.  Many mass murderers HAVE amassed their arsenals, Legally.)  The database should then have an algorhythm that analyzes each individual buyer's purchasing patterns, and then Flags areas of concern, putting a temporary HOLD on that person's ability to make further purchases, until such time as the authorities investigate.\n\nThe US needs to take mental health care just as seriously as all other forms of health care (if not more so!).\n\nHollywood is also to blame for promoting violence as a form of entertainment.  I don't care if Hollywood says 'well, that's what the people want'.  Hollywood should simply not provide it.  Every day throughout the NYC subway system, I see ads for the latest Hollywood 'blockbuster' movie, and 99% of these ads have guns as the Prominent feature in the ad.  Why just today I saw an ad for 'Den of Thieves', full of men with assault weapons! , 6 The second amendment needs to be looked at. When it was written there was no standing army; most people were farmers who needed a weapon for protection and food; there were no police or phones to call them if you needed protection; the weapons were muskets that were not very accurate; and the Revolutionary War was won by militia who came together when called. We no longer need that kind of protection against tyranny. Rather than guns, we should focus on votes as the weapon of choice., 6 I'm sorry, Trump/NRA, but the standard for our children's safety CANNOT be \"when all human evil and madness\" is solved, and that's precisely the bar you are implying every time you deny the most obvious, simple, and direct answer:\n\nWe cannot ever stop the madness, and evil within humanity or the world, but its so much easier and actionable to make the guns fewer, make them very difficult to obtain, and IF they have to exist, make them only for the limited purposes that do the least harm., 6 Make no mistake, the NRA, Trump and the Republicans are responsible. Period.  After so many tragic shootings, their collective so-called \"condolences\" designed to avoid the real issue, gun control, ring hollow and are insulting.  Knowing Trump has accepted millions of dollars from the NRA, he has zero moral authority to stand in front of a podium, address the nation, and offer \"fake\" condolences.  , 6 As these truly horrific, beyond belief, beyond comprehension, mass murders become horrifically common place our U.S. Congress and U. S. President continue to do nothing. \n\nThe reality is that in the United States of America the gun industry's profits are more important than innocent citizen's lives. Than our children's lives.\n\nIn a world now driven by big data, advanced micro-electronics, and pinpoint gps tracking, and the means to utilize it, we can regulate firearms, ammunition, and firearm accessories like ammunition magazines to make this type of tragedy less common and less destructive when it does happen.\n\nBut we do nothing as our Constitution is used by the gun industry to dupe our citizens into protecting the gun industry and their profits at the cost of human lives. \n\nThis is a Second Amendment problem; specifically the vulgarization of it for corporate profits. Citizen's lives willingly tradied for shareholder capital gains, dividends, and executive pay--all protected by our Congress, our President, and our Supreme Court.\n\nAmerican Gun Owners, and I am one, the citizen's right to own firearms and the government's right to regulate firearms are not mutually exclusive. We must act to rein in the use of firearms to kill innocent human beings--NOW. \n\nTo not act, to not speak out, makes all gun owners complicit in these murders. \n\nMB, 6 The President's speech is a major disappointment. But what else is new?, 6 Mothers of America United. It's time to remove our children from our Schools  until background checks are made Mandatory and AR-15 rifles are Outlawed. , 6 The NY Times might want to ak former Pres. Obama why his administration marked eight years of REDUCED gun crime prosecutions.\n      Should we demand that non-military AR-15's only use piston ammunition?\nIt is a MUCH easier wound to repair than the three-times-as-fast ammo usually used in the rifles which produces cavitation inside the body. , 6 By the way, if you enjoy these school shootings, you are gonna LOVE what's coming.\n\nWe have reached a point in our technological development at which the level of our scientific knowledge, and the intricate connectivity of our complex, material reality, makes it possible for more and more lunatics and fanatics to do more and more damage. \n\nMichael Crichton was dead right in \"Jurassic Park,\" to link advanced guns and advanced biological knowledge: they both make stupidity easy to act on, and they both ask us to learn nothing by way of self-discipline.\n\nLook at this latest lunatic: didn't need military or police training. Nothing fancy in terms of technical knowledge; very good chance he didn't even know how to disassemble and clean an AR. Certainly didn't know how to make his own ammo, or special tactics. \n\nHe was sold an assault rifle: no serious aiming necessary. Easy to reload, easy to point and shoot. Light ammo, so he could carry lots. Tactics? Not much needed, and that little was covered by violent games and movies. \n\nWe not only didn't stop him; we equipped him with weapons, ammunition, and simple moves that made the slightest knowledge, self-discipline, and ethical consideration completely unnecessary.\n\nYay, us., 6  I am from the no gun camp. If nobody has a gun then nobody needs a gun to protect them from the other guns.  After living for 55 years without one I am pretty sure I won't need one for the duration of my life. Call me crazy. Let's have a little wisdom in our policies, laws and quality of life please.\nI woke up early morning sickened by our  lack of intelligence, mindfulness and said wisdom.   Humans create wars, violence, and yes guns and we can un-create it as well  as soon as we get on with this transformation into a  more balanced masculine and  feminine planet.\n I am probably biased because I grew up with a father who had been a cop  which made him a gun owner. He went a little crazy over a woman, got fired, still owned the gun, took a shot at her and missed thank God. , 6 Hey, Floridians!  You can make $48,432.33 - $75,673.72 annually in the Broward County Sheriff's office approving background checks for firearms.  That means that guess who approved Nikolas Cruz's gun, magazine, and bullet purchases?  The guy who wants us to see something say something and hire more law enforcement?  He's supposed to keep his county safe, is that dereliction of duty?, 6 I wish Betsy DeVos would start to attend every funeral for a school shooting victim.  \n\nMaybe that would help get us beyond words and prayers., 6 If you\u2019re a gun advocate, NRA member, own an AR15 or buy guns at gun show, you have the blood of these kids on your hands. , 6 Another shooting tragedy involving a military-style assault rifle and, after calling for prayers, the Congress will move on to \"more pressing business\" such as building a \"wall\", how much it will cost the taxpayers, and, of course, how to coddle the super-rich.\n\nYesterday, the parents of 17 murder victims had to wait, and wait, hoping their children would run to their arms. Instead, just like the parents of the Sandy Hook School massacre, they were left waiting for news from the police that there children were still inside waiting for the coroner. Tears flowed, hugs were shared. \n\nIn the meantime, the NRA's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, will run to Fox Noise and tell their clueless audience, had all of those teachers been carrying weapons, this would not have been as bad as it was. Sell more guns, not less. Sell more high-capacity magazines. Sell more assault rifles to the masses. \n\nThe United States has been taken over by weaponized goon squads and their enablers in local, state and federal offices. And none of the politicians who were bought off, or scared by, the NRA can see the blood on their hands. \n\nConservatism is no longer about lawmakers wearing green eyeshades. Conservatism has run amok with catastrophic results at every turn. Virtually everything conservative lawmakers have touched since Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, has failed: Tax reform; healthcare, voter rights laws; campaign finance reform; the environment; reversing the assault weapons ban.  \n\nPrayers? Get real., 6 With semi automatic weapons and expanded capacity magazines, we turned firearms into deadly squirt guns. Just spray and reload. What are the loss of life and injury stats from the age of revolvers compared to this era of video game carnage? Chris Rock had a joke about charging $4,000 per bullet. The sad facts of this epidemic: it is inexpensive, too easy, and there is no training required for a deadly instrument. \n\nFor Congress, this is not about restricting rights. It is about recognizing the lethality of a product and making buyers show they will be responsible owners.   , 6 So someone was supposed to notify the authorities. Funny, in the NRA universe, a kid who's obsessed with guns is just a healthy red-blooded patriot. \n\nUntil he shoots his peers and the MAGA social media trolls start to allege he's a DACA kid based solely on his last name. \n\nThere's also already a truther conspiracy circulating (a la Newtown), that this is all an anti-2nd Amendment hoax. \n\nLife in 2018 USA, can't make this stuff up., 6 The important thing now is to get a good count.  One or two, even four or five, won't get you universal coverage on the all news networks. Have to shoot for ten at least. Then you get a full day devoted entirely to you. The usual speakers are trotted out to cluck and analyze. Survivors and, with any luck, the bereaved, are interviewed. Footage is shown over and over until new footage can be bought and the nation holds its breath while the networks dredge up photos of the shooter. If the count is a new record, a new bar is set. This one, though not a record, has Trump making an appearance. That's a definite plus. What do we think he'll say? Arm all students? Arm all teachers? Arm everyone? It's people who kill people, not automatic weapons? All of the above?, 6 The news media should stop saying killed and call it what it is, which is murdered.  17 STUDENTS MURDERED would get a lot more attention, because our children are being murdered. I guarantee if government officials were being MURDERED, no expense would be spared to protect them.  Our children certainly deserve the same., 6 So what will the solution be? To make all schools armed fortresses with metal detectors at the door? , 6 If we follow the gun lobby\u2019s logic, all teachers must be trained alongside combat soldiers and school uniforms/supplies must include a bullet proof vest.\n\nSticks and stones can break my bones,\nbut guns like these must be outlawed., 6 Does Wayne LaPierre have grandchildren?  What school do they attend?  Are they in danger?  His Salary: $972,000, paid for by automatic weapon rights fools.  This, the NRA, and Russia's invasion of our democracy - both weapons against our democracy., 6 \u201cSo many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThis is a quote from an earlier Times article. How ironic that the same words could be used to describe the president. It would be interesting to see his tweets if Twitter had been around in his youth., 6 I grew up in Broward County. These children are the grandchildren of my classmates.  In 1962 we drilled for the Cuban missile crisis by ducking and covering under our desks. President Kennedy skillfully kept us safe. Where is the leadership to keep our school children safe now? We need sensible gun control laws. Our leaders have blood on their hands., 6 No mental heath database or any such system would solve this problem, because there are far more  guns than actual human beings in this country; it would be easy to get your hands on a weapon. And the sad part is majority of the people are not even surprised by this tragedy. May be it is time the 300 year old amendment is displayed across the country in its entirely including \"well regulated militia\" and let people think if that amendment still make sense with people having AR-15's and trying to fight the present US fire power., 6 64 percent of all US homicides are gun related. America has at least 90 guns for every hundred households. Only yemen, a lawless and underdeveloped country, is anywhere close. The mass gun massacres are getting worse and worse in america. It is a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs andee need much stricter gun control laws, 6 Here's what President Trump had to say, \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\"\n\nEverybody knew, yet political obtuseness tolerated ownership of an AR-15. And the president supports Congress to enact interstate gun reciprocity so that this could happen as easily in Connecticut as in the Gunshine State, Florida. \n\nDRAG AMERICA DOWN AGAIN!, 6 There are no words; this is how we make America great again? And again, and again, and again, and again., 6 NRA: $30 million to the current president's campaign.\n\nFat chance of a policy change on automatic and semi-automatic weapons., 6 Perhaps a general strike by teachers to protest lack of workplace safety would be a useful catalyst for change, 6 I've seen countless decals, hoodies and banners with AK silhouettes in Florida, Texas and other red states glorifying the guns culture and then we wonder why young people and the unstable end up murdering dozens. It won't stop anytime soon no matter how many prayers and thoughts we send until the people who glorify the gun culture start to respect human lives. Now that should be the true meaning of being pro life. , 6 My parents live in Florida, and when I talked to my dad today, he said that the Florida legislature has two proposals in front of it: one that will put some restrictions on guns, and another that will allow guns to be carried in schools and churches. He thinks the first will fail, and the second will pass easily. And he has a good track record in making correct political predictions.\n\nSo Florida's response to this will probably be to arm everyone! These nuts will not be satisfied until they force every peace-loving citizen in this country to own and carry a weapon. We cannot let the lunatics run this nation! \n\nGet out and vote for legislators who will put a stop to guns flooding our society. Having MORE guns is not the solution. Florida has passed very lax gun laws in the past decade, and the more permission the state gives, the more mass shootings there are! , 6 What if all the parents of children attending schools in the USA banded together  and kept their Children out of school for 1 week  and marched on Washington a million strong and demanded that Congress and the President ban assault style weapons. , 6 The statement \u201cEnough is Enough!\u201d is not working and neither is \u201cI am sending my thoughts and prayers\u201d to stop the spread of Military Weapons being sold to the general public. They were designed to kill human beings and are very efficient at performing that task.\n\nCongress has been defending their sale thanks to the efforts of the NRA\u2019s and Gun Manufacturers\u2019 Campaign Contributions. \n\nHow about asking our Congress Representatives to show their \u201cConcern and Sorrow\u201d by returning the Campaign Contributions they received from these Groups?, 6 I was honestly scared of coming to school today. Last year, there was an armed student arrested here, and I'm sure there are a few who are willing and able to be copycat shooters in a sadistic game of killing.\n\nI don't care how I'm labelled or who labels me, what I care is that I shouldn't have to be concerned that I may be murdered during my lunch period, or trapped in a classroom, listening to the hallowing screams of others; and I'm only 16.\n\nThis can't go on., 6 This shooter was living with a \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d family.  He had guns in the home safe.  He had a key or combination to this safe.  He made comments on social media saying troubling things about guns and killing...\n\nWhat is wrong with this picture?, 6 We have Trump as president and the NRA as puppeteer.  This is what winning looks like for them., 6 NRA = No Real Action, 6 Voting for NRA-funded Republican candidates makes you complicit in these murders., 6 You need a more fact-based headline. How about \"Heavily armed teen-ager...\" ?, 6 Why do these mass shootings not happen Canada or Australia or Europe?, 6 There is evidence that school shootings and mass shooting are \"contagious\" (Recent paper in PLOS One, Towers et al., 2015).  Focusing on the shooter (photo was visible earlier today), providing details about him, fuel the contagion.  The Sandy Hook shooter sought to set a record for number of victims. The media largely play down \"suicide clusters\" in schools.  We need a similar agreement for school and mass shootings., 6 There is a reasonable solution. Harden the schools as they are too easy to attack. 1. All students have to go through metal detectors in the AM. 2. Lock all the doors so they can only open outwards. 3. All traffic after school starts must go through a main door where we post an armed security guard. 4. Train teachers who volunteer to be armed and trained.\nA serious school fire has not happened in 50 years yet we have fire drills but not mas shooting drills. , 6 The press conference is sick making. Everyone is focused on the wrong things.\nThe only solution is a return to the assault weapons ban.\nThe rest of the hyperbole is dangerous, most cops are unable to remain objective and detached when giving a traffic ticket I certainly don't want them searching all that I have said for things they can spin into useful evidence to harass or jail me. \n\nOnce again you cannot predict these things. You cannot prevent these things from happening. The only thing you can REASONABLY do in a FREE society is to restrict access to the weapons used.  Those are the only facts that should be focused on here and in any similar event. Anything else is grandstanding pie in the sky bologna. \n\nIt would also be reasonable to mandate that gun owners have a safe to store their weapons in. Or we could do as Chris Rock once suggested charge $500 per bullet. That doesn't account for the people who reload their brass but it sure would restrict the numbers of mass shootings.\n\nI'd also suggest we turn our gaze towards the politics of the last 40 years. We never had this problem with frequent mass shootings before the reagan republicans destroyed our government by the people and for the people turning it into government by and for the one percent. All of our protection have been taken away and the one agency created to fix that since reagan has now been taken over and hamstrung by its administrator in exactly the same way reagan's criminal cabal did it in the 80's.  , 6 To all those people who cling to the notion that they have the right to purchase and carry military-grade weapons because of the 2nd Amendment, I have an idea...Go ahead, buy all of the single shot muskets that were the technology of the day when the Constitution was written. Let's only make that gun available to the public so they can exercise their rights. The Founding Fathers didn't envision high capacity round magazines and the guns that create today's carnage when they wrote the 2nd Amendment, so for all of you who scream that we have to follow their writings to the letter, have at it. But you only get to buy the gun that was available at that time. Only then will victims of shootings and law enforcement have a chance the next time someone tries to commit mass murder because they wont have to outrun a hail of bullets.\n\nConstantly overlooked in the 2nd Amendment is the notion of firearms being \"well regulated,\" the Founding Father's words, not mine. Sadly, no one, especially the NRA wants to acknowledge that important detail., 6 Even all our collective prayers, anguish, and desire to really do something about these terrible School shootings, can never do anything for the children and families who've suffered as part of these horrendous, stoppable crimes. A country's first responsibility is to keep its children safe - how can we keep failing so terribly at this collective responsibility - and focus on anything else? Clearly the country can align on what it feels are it's responsibilities and execute - we have seen that post 9/11. How can we not feel and demand the same bar to be set in place for protecting our children. Its incomprehensible to me that the law makers (and frankly even citizens who are letting these lawmakers get away with this) can live with themselves. We each have to step up to take the moral responsibility to mobilize the lawmakers to act on this - today and now., 6 It's an illusion to think that this would be the last tragedy hitting this country. We always hope that something would change but, unfortunately, we are in a dangerous vicious circle. In this moment millions of lethal weapons are out there ready to kill me, you our our loved children while in Washington the politicians are silent or, at best, copying and pasting the usual condolence note. Until now nothing has changed because money and business are more important than innocent lives and on top our inaction makes us jointly responsible for these tragedies . We have become just chronic complainer and nothing else., 6 The NRA and those who take funds from them and support them are terrorist enablers. Off to Guantanamo with this lot!, 6 Disturbing as this latest shooting is, what is even worse is that no one seems focussed on the idea that massive, nonstop news coverage makes the next one more likely. News reporters, MSNBC programs and local news switch to horrific mode every time. There are lots of comments about a well regulated militia, the trauma parents face, listings of the names and activities of the victims, etc. We should face the fact that with our polarized country nothing is going to be done on the gun front. That means that the only way to lessen these events is to deny them media coverage. That is a hard thing to do, maybe impossible given all the different sources for news. It likely requires state or federal laws. This approach will resonate with gun lobby and gun control people, and may attract bipartisan support. Gun control groups welcome these events, thinking that finally they will get some traction implementing gun control. The gun lobby makes its expected comments that more guns will help matters. Face it. These approaches are doomed. We have guns and will always have them. Lets adapt., 6 Mark my words - the US faces a choice.\n\nEither we limit who can carry a gun or we go with universal surveillance.  Either we limit who can carry a gun or we all surrender to police monitoring 24/7.  , 6 \"\u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d President Trump wrote on Twitter.\"\n\nReally?\n\nThat's it?\n\nThis what we get from our President on the occasion of yet another massacre of students on his watch?\n\nA Tweet?\n\nA lying, cynical, self-serving Tweet at that?\n\nAnd now this horrible boy is in custody.  After months of reports, expressions of concern, and apparently regular gossip that just such a thing was in the works.\n\nOh, and that post that he planned to be a school shooter, forwarded to the FBI.\n\nIsn't this awfully similar to the way we realized it might be a swell idea to secure airplane cockpits, and maybe watch out for citizens of troubled regions who come to America to \"learn to fly but not to land\"?  After the damage.\n\nWe haven't learned, we will not learn, a thing.\n\nExcept to boast to the rest of the (safer and saner) world how very excellent we are.\n\nOn a positive note, we have excelled at creating ever more entertaining and informative graphics showing dead students.  \n\nThat's something., 6 I see we're told this was caused by the FBI. It was caused by them dratted lib'ruls who is done tore down, \"the Judeo-Christian ethic.\" It's feminazis' attack on the Holy Family. \n\nWhy, it's even high schools' not having heavy enough doors.\n\nIt's somebody, something, anything else than the simple stuff it is: we've flooded the country with fancy guns nobody really needs, we've rejected doing meaningful background checks on everybody, we refuse to take guns away from obvious nutjobs and obvious threats, we fill the airwaves with violent imagery and conspiracy theories and the fantasy that more guns will solve our problems.\n\nOh, and we allow unlimited campaign contributions from gun nut orgs like the NRA, and we've elected a President and a Congress that is not going to do a single...solitary....blessed thing, no matter how high the body count gets. \n\nSo despite how straightforward a lot of the solution would be--get rid of assault rifles (and yea, they are, but feel free to quibble as the bodies pile up), yank guns away from florid nutjobs like this kid, do universal background checks, we are not gonna do a thing. \n\nKnow why we yack about this stuff, every time seventeen more people get holes blown in them? \n\nSo we don't have to change anything. , 6 I can not believe that there are more members in the NRA than people who want stricter gun laws.  Time to stand up to the NRA and all its money. Stand up. Speak up for those who can no longer speak. Shame on all legislators who have missed opportunities to pass laws to eliminate accessibility of automatic weapons. Shame on voters who elect those legislators. When it is time to vote, find out who's in the pocket of the NRA and other gun lobbies.  Remember these children, teachers, and bystanders who deserve our advocacy. Right now Congress is taking steps toward more leniency through the idea of a national concealed carry law. Call legislators. Let your voice be heard for those who can not., 6 Same horrors, same old bromides every time. \"\u201cThis is catastrophic,\u201d said Sheriff Israel, who has three children who graduated from the high school. \u201cThere really are no words.\u201d\nYes there are, sir: \"gun control\" and \"better mental health care\"., 6 My heartfelt condolences and prayers to the fallen victims and to those injured victims and all their families. It is so inadequate for the permanent, unfathomable loss they have suffered. How many more deaths until our greedy legislators stop receiving blood money from the notorious NRA and stopping their anti-America agenda? What will it take to scrap the archaic Second Amendment which is so irrelevant in the age we live in? Crocodile tears and crocodile empathy from these corrupt leaders - infuriating, disgusting, simply monstrous. Even cave men did not eat their own kids.!, 6 \nThe NRA is covered in blood., 6 Please publish all the names of politicians who take money from the NRA.\nThey're complicit.  , 6 Once again the response from Republicans are hopes and prayers.  Can we hope and pray that Trump gets IMPEACHED.  , 6 I believe that Congress, Trump and the NRA should be held responsible for these murders of young innocents.\nThe Congress and the NRA managed to do away with the Brady Bill and when these mass murders began, stood mute or made ridiculous arguments defending the 2nd Amendment which \"gives the citizens the right to bear arms.\"  There was no such thing as assault weapons when the 2nd Amendment was adopted.\n\nWill it take one of Trump's children or one of the Congress' children to be caught up in a mass murder to finally have them come to their senses?  It certainly did not change their stance when two of their own were nearly fatally shot.\n\nIt is a false argument that these men and women are \"defending our right to bear arms.\"  They should all be tried for murder as they have stood in the way of meaningful gun reform and the consequences are all of these innocent lives might have been spared., 6 Nothing will be done.\nFor Congress, the lunatic ravings of the NRA are far more important than 17 dead kids.\nThese 17 kids had a senator who was supposed to represent them. But Marco Rubio voted for the gun show and internet loopholes.\nMoney speaks louder than dead kids., 6 I am left wondering how this country can still commit to the maxim that all have the right to bear arms??, 6 How did the gunman get past school security screens that should have picked up metal weapons? Were there any of these in the school? News reports have not said whether or not they were in place., 6 If America is wise enough to create and post the 'Me Too' movement on social media, why not create and post a 'Them Too- Wall of Shame' movement on social media for your congress folks whose strings are pulled by the NRA?\n\nIf it worked against Harvey Weinstein, Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey, why wouldn't/couldn't it work against Senator So and So for her/his pro-gun votes?, 6 I wonder if people who believe most everyone should be able to have a gun would believe that if they knew their child would be one of the 30,000 gun deaths each year., 6 Let me guess: Would this be \"too soon\" to discuss gun control?, 6 this is rick scott and trump's fault. we should all thank them for making it easier for psychos to own guns and create a massive bullying type of environment. it is horrendous what this 19yo did. but i also have to condemn both the school and the students at that school! it's absolutely deplorable that this school allowed a so-called \"emo gazebo\" to isolate kids labeled as creepy or weird. so stop blaming just the killer. you also have to blame the school for creating such a toxic environment. would this have happened if the school intervened last year? i doubt yesterday's tragedy would have happened. , 6 There seems to be no blame at all on the shooter., 6 And Trump is talking up a big military parade with lots of tanks and fire power. Just what we don't need. What we need are sane gun laws and universal background checks for a start. How could anyone who was on this man's social media site not alert his family or authorities to the depraved mindset he was in. Why couldn't his friends take action to prevent an atrocity like this from happening?, 6  Obama was so right: there is no tragedy, no rational plea that will reach those who \"cling\" to their guns - no matter what. It's depressing., 6 When we ensure Congress has the same level of security as we afford the children in our schools, then things will change., 6 Very sad and disturbing. I wish that these images weren't available as they are not helpful in any way. I cannot comprehend how these weapons can be available. I suppose it's about money and power?, 6 This is the same old same old. With one difference: the students got videos on their cell phones. Please, please, NYT or some national tv station: get those videos and show them over and over and over again. Remember how powerful witness can be., 6 Anyone who is votes against gun control in this country, or who votes for politicians who support the NRA, is directly responsible for the death of a child.\n\nAs a nation, we are abetting these murders.   We are accessories. \n\nTo anyone who does not support gun control:   what you are saying is that your gun is more important than a child.   Do you have children?   Are you willing to have them gunned down during a school day rather, if it meant you could keep your gun?   \n\nIf the answer is no, then what you are saying is that it's not okay to kill your kid, but it's okay to kill someone else's kid., 6 ...and the countdown clock begins for the next mass shooting in the US. Only question is \"where will it be?\", 6 \u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d Trump tweeted. But he failed to mention that his loyalty to the NRA was undiminished.\n\nHere's the ugly conclusion: Because the cowards on Capitol Hill are petrified of their NRA masters, parents who send their children to school everyday have no guarantee that the children will return home in the afternoon. Think about it. A parent kisses his of her little kid on the head and says, `Be careful. Have a great day.' And then returns to their home and wonders if that's the last time they see their kid alive. The NRA and their hostages in Washington - unwilling to sacrifice a dime in campaign donations - has created a nation of shooting galleries. If you want to kill young ones, we have K-6; junior-high galleries are available; and if you want to kill high schoolers like those in Florida, pick a town anywhere in America.\n\nCareful. Have a good day., 6 Where does a kid buy a AR-15 semi- auto rifle? Apparently, it\u2019s not a problem. Houston, we have a problem. BTW- to turn a semi- auto rifle into a fully automatic rifle is no problem. You just take out the firing pin in the bolt assembly and file it down. I learned this when I was in USMC., 6 Score another victory for Wayne LaPierre and the NRA!\nWithout their untiring efforts to buy congressmen this would not have been possible. We would not have the right to enter a school carrying lethal weapons our forefathers never even dreamed of and we couldn't set new records in the art of massacre on an almost weekly basis.\nThese people must be so proud\nSeriously, how do these people sleep nights?, 6 After yet another senseless mass shooting who is going to survive the longest in the USA? Ordinary people or the dinosaurs in the NRA and the politicians who refuse to bring in sensible gun control? After all the argument that being able to carry weapons makes you safe doesn't hold water because the shooters are not going to advertise were they are going to do their evil deeds and the chances of their being stopped before the killing starts is virtually zero., 6 This seem so obvious to me.\n There is NOT just ONE thing that can prevent gun violence & mass shootings. However, if we use an analogy with cars, we can use some common sense. In order to get a license to drive a car you need to take a written and a driving test. As a nation, we saw that even with the license, deaths were occurring by autos. So, car manufacturers were required to put in seat belts....and then they put in front air bags....and then side airbags...and then cars were made so that the car crumpled in an accident, but the driving compartment was stable.\nWe still get deaths by auto, HOWEVER, the numbers of deaths were reduced because we have common sense safety requirements.\n\nSo, gun safety measures can be put in place, and NOBODY is gonna take your gun away; we will probably still have gun violence, but we can at least cut the number of deaths & mass shootings (by 50% ?, or 25% ?, or even 10%).....isn't that worth it ????, 6 With the parents' permission, some of the crime scene photos should be made public. The American public needs to understand the full effect of these mass shootings, and an image is worth 1,000 words. \n\nOnly when the American public will be truly outraged there will be some action. Until then, we are stuck in this Groundhog day of inaction., 6 And yet the people accountable to us, \"we the people,\" do nothing. It is up to us to actually be heard. Vote them out. Take our powers back from the NRA. Why was this young man whose mental condition needed professional attention not provided with that attention? Who is accountable for his access to the weapons he displayed and used? He needed to be cared for and his fellow beings did not deserve to become his victims. Over and over we are taught painfully these lessons and we have not acted effectively. Words are not enough. Let us act with the power of our citizenship, please!, 6 I would like to see the NYT send a copy of the \"Comments Section\" to Florida Senators Rubio and Nelson.  If this isn't a bi-partisan issue, then what is. , 6 There are preventable deaths and unpreventable deaths; the categories are determined by biology, policy, technology, and freewill.  \n\nNot every murder is preventable.  Some of them surely are., 6 With so many mass shootings being done by illegal immigrants, surely there can be no better way to spend $25 billion dollars than on that wall!\n\nOh, wait..., 6 Another FBI failure.  They were warned that this boy was a violent threat.\nThis is the list of warnings about terrorism that the FBI flubbed.  The FBI ignored warnings about Arab flight students, the Boston Bombers, the San Bernardino, the Orlando and the Chelsea bomber.\n\nWas anybody held accountable for these failures? Was anybody fired or demoted?  Instead of trying to frame Donald Trump and overturn the election the intelligence community should be protecting us from terrorism., 6 How many more of our children have to die before we take action., 6 Have you had enough, America?  No civilian needs an AR15 rifle.  Will you call your elected officials every day to tell them to do the right thing and stop the carnage by finally passing meaningful gun regulation so this does not keep happening.  Keep calling them and writing to them.  And vote in every election, local and national., 6 The shooter should disappear from the media as a message to others - you do something like this?  you are gone, invisible.\nSo much energy pours into these events. Help stop the madness by denying this evil the notariety it craves., 6 The NRA sends money to Congressmen.\nCongress does NOTHING meaningful.\nA Mass Shooting.\nMore Thoughts and Prayers.\nSchool kids DIE.\n\nMaybe we could, as a country, try something different?, 6 My heart goes out to those that have lost so much so sensuously yet again.  While no one needs a semi-automatic rifle this carnage could have been caused by a shotgun. We need to do the hard work of figuring out why people feel this is an acceptable way to express their anger or what ever drives them to do this.  There are some that will not allow gun control so, lets go at it a different way., 6 We value gun ownership more then our children ., 6 Regardless of the underlying psychopathology motivating this shooter, the National Rifle Association and its supporters in Congress and state legislatures are ultimately responsible for each and every death caused by guns. End of story. \n\nThe easy availability of guns in this country is a gross distortion of the Second Amendment. This guy was not defending his home as part of a \"Well-ordered militia\" Nor were the shooters in 99% of gun deaths and injuries in America. This is the result of greedy gun manufacturers and ignorant people who may actually believe that when guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns. Well outlaws still have guns and how much safer are we? Every supporter of the NRA and their representatives in government should have to wonder what if that was my kid or grandchild? When will Americans finally wake up to the idiocy of easy gun availability and especially availability of automatic weapons. What sport needs automatic weapons that can fire dozens of shots without needing to be reloaded. The NRA should be sued out of existence and their leaders and supporters should be tried as accessories to murder., 6 The story of this shooter is fundamentally boring.  Like the others, disgruntled, narcissistic, nuts.  Armed.  Mad about a girl, a grade, an expulsion, racist, a personal animus.  Armed.  \n\nThe only interesting thing in this horrible taking of innocent lives is that we still allow assault weapons to be sold, owned, and used in our land.  When will it stop?  When will we make it stop?  That is the only question now. , 6 Terrorism is pushback from losers in a winner take all society. Get used to it folks, the more inequality we have the more terrorism we get.  It's that simple. , 6 45 sends his condolences on Twitter? I miss having a person with a sense of morality and humanity in the White House. How far down we have gone., 6 This is excellent reporting, however for these tragic situations why do you choose to use honorific titles such as Mr. for a mass-murderer? This is wrong., 6 Start a campaign to repeal the 2nd amendment. Now., 6 These kinds of tragedies do not happen over here in the UK because they have strict gun controls and the society is so much less violent than the USA which appears barbaric from across the 'pond.' As an American living over here seeing these tragedies happen over and over again I begin to wonder how many parents in these communities where these shootings take place support the NRA and their ideology? The federal laws will never change until this most powerfully monied lobby and their bribed, corrupt Congressmen who will not vote against gun control laws are defeated and the belief system they proliferate is eviscerated., 6 The only solution I see is to demand that the NRA does what it preaches: Let people carrying guns they approve of (that means all) to carry anyplace, come also to their headquarters and activities. , 6 It is even redundant, nowadays, to say, \"Here we go, again!\"  Not only are we seeing another school shooting, but once again, we have to listen to the diatribe about the shooter's mental health instead of focusing what is wrong with our gun laws.  It should go without saying that someone who dies this is mentally ill.  Normal people do not kill other people in a mass shooting.  While many of us have the capacity to kill someone in a moment of rage (this may be more true for men than women) given a gun at our fingertips,  very few of us plan to go on a shooting rampage.\n\nIt is good to take note that the signs were there for this kid to \"go off\" at some unexpected time and to take note that kids who torture animals have severe mental issues, so we can stay more alert to the warning signs. But that will not solve the problem.\n\n What is as psychotic as his kid's behavior is our collective psychosis when it comes to dealing with the issue of guns., 6 While your children die, your politicians continue accepting contributions from gun associations, manufacturers, in most countries, its called a bribe. why isn't this being reported as an act of terrorism. Condolences to lives lost. , 6 Visiting Fort Lauderdale every year for a month ( 20 miles from shooting) is surreal enough without this horrible event. But, when we return home to the cold and rain in a few days, we will still be ' close\" to other possible shootings. One almost happened near home recently.\n\nI have one very cynical thought for those who resist a ban on assault rifles. Wondering how they would react if someone mowed down 31 dogs instead of kids?, 6 Enough is enough.  Before the finger pointing and politics begin let me say this is all of our faults.  We each have a voice and obviously we are not screaming loud enough.  Scream, SCREAM.  , 6 \u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d President Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d\n\nLots of prayers and condolences, no action to regulate guns or ammo.  In fact, he's supporting NRA-backed legislation to allow gun owners to cross-state lines form the least regulated states to any state, under the guise of \"2nd Amendment Rights\" (CBS 60 Minutes 2/11).  \n\nThere is no shame, and there is no responsibility, from those who can do something about it, and plainly, proudly, refuse.  Again, the majority of Americans want regulations, similar to what other democratic countries have, that would at least make an attempt to control guns and ammo.  \n\nTo those in the pocket of the NRA: we know who you are, and you should not be re-elected again.  Another reason for the majority of Americans to vote. Just vote.  NYTimes, please make sure these worthless politicians get the repeated publicity they deserve for their continued moral depravity.  , 6 It is a sin, more fundamental and serious than merely a crime, to cause or tolerate the death of a innocent in exchange for money.  Yet that is precisely what our  elected representatives do by refusing every day to ban assault weapons in exchange for money from the NRA\u2014\u2014even those who hypocritically claim to \u201cpray\u201d for the victims and their families.  See John McCain\u2019s $7,000,000 plus haul.  One wonders, to what god do they pray?, 6 Until 5,000,000 Americans march on Washington and flood congress and the Whitehouse demanding an end to guns in America nothing will ever happen.\nJust think about thst we have had the million mand march we have had a million womens march but never a 5 million american march to end guns in America. Lets do it now., 6 The NRA owns the Republican party. If you vote Republican you own this., 6 It\u2019s time to march, donate, advertise...for gun control. If all the people who wished for change, acted, then there would be change. , 6 Are we ever going to find out if the story that came out a few weeks ago...that Russia channelled money to the Republican Party through the NRA is true?  Is this the problem with Republican representatives in stopping gun violence?  , 6 I love my country and the ideals for which it so imperfectly stands. But days like this make me ashamed to be an American. We already know how this is going to go, since these incidents have become routine. Politicians will call for hopes and prayers for the families. There will be a few calls for gun restrictions. Louder voices will say now is not the time to talk about such things. It will all quickly fade as we move on to the next shocking headline or enraging tweet. In the end, we'll do nothing.\n\nOnce we let a room full of first graders die in Sandy Hook without any response from our government, I lost hope that we could respond meaningfully and appropriately as a nation to gun violence. These events happen with greater frequency and greater deadliness every year, yet we do nothing. What's wrong with us?, 6 What horror and tragedy.  For the people's sake, whenever possible we should not visit or buy goods from businesses in states with permissive gun laws.  Only money will speak to these people., 6 Another Loyal Trump Subject with an AR-15! No problem, Trump's off the hook, he already Tweeted his thoughts and prayers., 6 This morning we fully expect to hear from the usual bunch of hypocrites in Congress and the administration feigning shock.They will invoke \"prayers and support\" for the victims families.\nRUBBISH! These people have no morals, no ethics no conscience.Save your crocodile tears and put your hankies away! These men have no God if they continue to enable guns, particularly assault weapons to be legal.While there is a bill standing in the wings that would make gun carriers allowed to carry weapons in states where they are presently illegal if they have a license from a state where they are, like recognizing a drivers license from another state.\nSo expect to hear the empty words but expect nothing from these God-invoking lackeys of the NRA. , 6 Former U.S. Secret Service agent, Jason Wells, explains the motivations behind shootings like this and specific ways (beyond gun control) to help people before they ever reach the breaking point: http://insidethelaw.co/jason-wells.html, 6 Looking at the areal imagery of the school, I am not surprised that something horrible happened there. What a bleak building. In the ex-communist Czech Republic, at least we paint our prefab houses with colors and geometric patterns. That place looks like a prison.\n\nAnd so close to a massive highway interchange too. The noise and the smell from the traffic must be driving ALL of the students insane.\n\nI would hate to live in such an awful place., 6 It's surprising, actually, how many of these things get done with assault rifles.  Most modern handguns are semi-auto too; some take big clips; they're easy to conceal; and you can buy them legally in the South like you were buying a cup of coffee.  With a pair of handguns, a person could easily do what happened yesterday, or worse.  And not even the most ambitious gun control legislation -- at least not any with a shred of a chance -- goes anywhere near them.\n\nBut it seems like it's *always* an assault rifle in these mass-killing events.  And the bought-and-paid-for Repugs can't even get serious about bump stocks, much less the weapons themselves.  The blood is on their hands.  And one of these days, one of the victims' loved ones will take matters into his/her own hands.  Something's gotta give., 6 Florida taxpayers will pay for the funerals? Why not make the gun lobby pay? And make the gun lobby pay when they have to tear the school down and build another because no one will want to go there anymore. And make the gun lobby pay for the counseling for all the people traumatized by this shooting all all the others. Make the gun lobby pay for the additional costs for police. Make the gun lobby pay to launder the bedding and PJs of all the little kids who will have accidents in bed because they are having nightmares about going to school.And make the gun lobby pay for all the early retirement of teachers around the country too afraid to walk into classrooms anymore. Make the gun lobby pay the lost time for everyone who must go through training about scholl lock-downs. When are we going to rise up against the gun lobby? WHEN????, 6 America the land of the Free? \n\nIs a person more free if they can own a gun, or if they can attend school, movies, festivals without being shot dead?\n\nDefend the right rights., 6 Looks like americans are not able to learn anything. It\u00b4s simple as 1 plus 1. Too many arms around....., 6 This is such a tragedy and one that should never happen in our schools.  If some of the teachers or administration were armed this might have ended before 17 people were killed.  They target schools because we are making them targets.  No gun laws will stop this from happening.  Those with evil intentions will get a gun.  Gun control only makes sets up more victims to be killed.  You don't ever hear of any attacks on school is Israel schools.  Because their teachers are armed and trained to protect their students.  The highest crime rates in America are in cities with the strictest gun laws.  , 6 To me the question is, why do we still have a second ammendment? It is a historically incongruous piece of legislation which has no place in a 21st century society. It is useless against the power of government, people no longer need to hunt for their food and there\u2019s a standing army and police of all sorts.\n\nAre the bad guys under control? Not really. However, kids, law enforcement and various innocent people are dead because of it. And, Wayne LaPierre owns this., 6 I\u2019m sorrowed for everyone involved in this tragedy, including the troubled shooter.   Putting aside all of the tired gun defenses you hear at a time like this \u201cguns don\u2019t fire themselves, \u201cit\u2019s a mental health issue\u201d, \u201cdo we eliminate cars too?\u201d semi-automatics are the obvious, proximate enabler of most of the mass killings in America.   People with access to these weapons inflict tragedy on a scale they otherwise could not.   And every year their availability becomes easier.   \n\nIf Congress will not address this issue head-on, we might as well remove the bar on fully-automatic weapons as well.  They don\u2019t fire themselves either.  , 6 This horrific act, 17 human beings rob of their beautiful lives and so many others traumatized  for the rest of their life. Our current adminstration has done absolutely nothing to prevent this from happening, nothing. \n\nSomeone please tell me how in good conscience these elected official   continue to take money, thousand's of dollars from the N.R.A. to fund their elections and sleep at night. \n\nMaybe it will take the loss of live of someone they hold dear by a AR-15 , 6 My granddaughter was one of the victims in this latest shooting.   Congress Members who support the NRA position of doing nothing but offer prayers should be charged as accessories to murder.\nMy wonderful grand daughter is gone.  She was a wonderful talented giving person.  How many others have to die?, 6 The boy on the grass in handcuffs looks too much like the boy who shot up the batman movie; and too much like troubled boys in nearly every large high school in America.\nIt's as easy as A, B, C:\nA. Make visually realistic video games where shooting as many people as possible is the goal, but which are 'just for fun.'\nB. Put assault rifles just like those from the games in the hands of kids who are isolated and disenfranchised.\nC. Write the next headline., 6 I realize that the majority of your NYT readers are experts in firearms, but this incessant harping on AR-15 suggests a strain of ignorance and/or stupidity bordering on the Trumpian.\nIf I were planning to shoot up a confined area such as a school or a night club, the last thing I would use is a long barreled rifle.\nThere are plenty of handguns with extended magazines that are far more facile in close quarters and would permit the simultaneous use of two weapons instead of one.\nIf you really want to do something about school shootings, require the gunmen to use RPGs. That would really slow them down., 6 It is time to shut down the National Rifle Association. Civilized society should join together to implement a total boycott of all NRA employees and any organization that is doing business with it. Anyone associated with the NRA should be treated as a pariah and not welcome anywhere. , 6 Trump does't have what it takes to go to Florida.  He should ask his predecessor, President Obama, to go in his stead., 6 Watch one again proof beyond a doubt that our government is not ours. It is not a democracy. It is owned by special intrest., 6 we  have  sympathy  and  empathy  for  the  victims's   family., 6 Sadly this is part of American Culture. No one should be surprised, it is simply something the citizens are willing to live with. So life goes on for the living and all the lamenting in the media is ironic to say the least. Time to agree that nothing will change. Most thought Sandy Hook was the tipping point.\nGod Bless America and may the families of the fallen find the inner spiritual strength to be able to cope., 6 Waiting for the vacuous Trump tweet, such as \"I'm totally against mass shootings! Terrible and sad!!\" Followed by the inevitable total inaction on the part of our useless, corrupt lawmakers. How do we tolerate this?, 6 another member of the \u2018well regulated militia\u2019? you\u2019d think upon reaching the supreme court, one would be able to read the entirety of the second amendment., 6 Support for the NRA by our politicians is about making sure that the populace lives in fear. Trump needs us to be afraid for him to have power. The Republicans need us to be afraid in order to keep power. It turns out that being afraid and living in fear leads a population to accept authoritarian rule and authoritarian rule is good for the bottom line of many of our leaders. So, we won't get any substantial gun control laws or mental health assistance. No, fear is good for our leaders., 6 Britain enacted strict laws against guns after the school shooting in Scotland 20 years ago. There have been no more school shootings.\n\nAustralia and Japan have enacted similar restrictions. No more school shootings.\n\nIn all these cases, the first concern was for the lives of students and children. There was no quibbling about second amendment rights, socialism, freedom, democracy or all the other isms that are trotted out whenever people get afraid their assault rifles will be taken away from them.\n\nBut, then, there is less selfishness masquerading as freedom in the countries I mentioned, the countries where children's live are paramount., 6 And the NRA claimed irresponsibility...., 6 I'm sure the Republicans will blame Cupid for yet another school being turned into a killing field. All that depiction of arrows through hearts is obviously desensitizing our children. (They're already claiming that he's a Dreamer -- interesting given the longstanding GOP support for our systematic Cuban brain drain.)\n\nThe fact that you can purchase this weapon at Walmart without a license, a permit, or waiting period? Well.........................., 6 I wonder what will be the end game in this perpetual cycle of domestic terrorism which affects American schools and other areas where civilians peacefully congregate.\n\nThe xenophobia characterizing the Trump regime as well as the GOP is quite ironic.  All of those #MAGA supporters preach hatred and fear of Hispanics and Muslims, whereas the average American is more likely to get killed by other Americans born and raised in the USA.  When will Americans wake up and realise that the enemies are WITHIN-- they are both the hate-intoxicated domestic terrorists like Cruz AND a morally bankrupt Congress locked in a mortal embrace with the greatest supporter of domestic terrorism, the NRA.\nI surely do hope it won't take an eye for eye moment on Capitol Hill by outraged citizens 'taking advantage' of their constitutional rights to bear arms in order to dispose of an increasingly corrupt and tyrannical regime., 6 Once again we are outraged and shocked!! at the mass shooting in a Florida school, after all, we were overdue for this real \"American Carnage\"! So, what will happen now? Everybody and their mothers will send thought and prayers to the family of the victims. This has worked wonders in the past and no doubt it will go a long way to console the poor souls who are going through the most devastating event of their lives.It is ridiculous if not stupid that we, the people of the 21st Century, still can believe that offering prayers will somehow prompt God to help the mourning parents. Exactly what are we praying for? If God listens to you may I suggest that you pray for the disappearance of Wayne Lapier and the merderous organization that he leads. While you are at it, pray that those murderers on NRA's payroll, sitting in the Congress opposing gun regulation legislaions also disappear. Then if you really are serious, don't vote for anybody that opposes Gun Regulations, Second ammendment or not. Never mind that the Second Ammendment gives no such Right to every Citizen to bear Arm. The Court that interpretd the Second Ammenment as The Right to bear Arms, did not read, or understand,  the first two sentences of the Ammendment which clearly refers to maintaining a well regulated Militia by arming the citizens. These days we have a well regulated Armed Forces costting us north of $700 billion a year. therefore,Citizens need not be armed with assault rifles with high capacity magazines, 6 Our hearts must be united in the resolve to be a community, locally and nationally. Every sector must come to the table to tackle prevention from so many urgent angles. While we wait for our representatives to resolve policy, we all must help join a chain of observers who are alert and interested in our own family and neighbors, signs that someone is experiencing symptoms that left unchecked could escalate into this kind of aggression. It must start around kitchen tables, around living rooms, getting to know one another not just through digital means. Expressing our concerns in person, and listening.\n\nhttps://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources/school-s...\n\nhttps://www.sandyhookpromise.org/about, 6 We need metal detectors in our schools. Stricter gun laws will not prevent armed killers from entering schools and murdering innocents., 6 If Putin is spending big money coordinating Russian bots and influence peddlers to destabilize our democracy he really doesn\u2019t need to bother. With mass shootings only increasing since the beginning of the year, we are destroying ourselves from within., 6 Again with video games. Really?\nHere in Greece kids play exactly the same video games. But they do not go around killing people. Yes, weapons are not as easy to get, but for years you could easily buy an AK (from the Albanian military stocks) for less money than a console would cost.\nSo it is not about the games. Having lived in the USA, studied there, and having family there, I think people in the USA are kind, friendly, descent. But they are wrapped into a violent culture that praises a warrior more than a scholar, a gangster more than a policeman, a serial killer more than his victims. Violence, both on all kinds of media and in real life, is in abundance in the USA, and if you combine that with the ease of access to weapons and ammunition then it is not difficult to understand why things happen. And no, it wasn't mental issues either. That is an easy excuse, because if you go down that road, then the failure of the country to provide for its mentally ill , people, to care for them, but also to place restrictions on them is enormous.\nSo you can blame Call of Duty all you want, and maybe video games play some role in such disturbing situations, but it is not the only thing. People in the USA should really take a look around to understand why things happen, not just give out blame and take comfort in God's will. I am sure that God did not think of assault rifles and semiautomatic pistols in the hands of kids, killing other kids!\nHug your loved ones a little longer today!, 6 People need to march in the streets against this madness and against the NRA and automatic weapons.  Too many have died.  There are killings every day.  It is too much., 6 Terrible loss for everyone. Cannot imagine being a parent or student there. Also I am shocked that shooting after shooting nothing happens to the gun laws. Nobody needs an AR15, to be honest no one needs a gun in general. For a Western nation I find it truly sad that one cannot even guarantee the safety of students because of an old amendment. , 6 It's right there in the Constitution: \"The right to shoot up schools, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nOr something like that.\n\nSure, pray and mourn.  But when will America get angry enough to throw off the dead hold that the NRA has over the lives of your children?, 6 The media should never name the shooter, in case there is some sick need for infamy. Use a derisive name or nickname or something., 6 Here we go again. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of you. Now is not the time to discuss because we don't yet have all the facts. \n\nMeaning the gun lobby is much more important than the lives of our children. Our inability and unwillingness to deal with the 800lb gorilla in the room insures that our children will continue to die in mass by way of weapons designed for that purpose. I am not sure anymore why we even bother with the useless back and forth. Apparently talk and proclamations of condolences should be more than enough to compensate. \n\nCongress and the NRA will not be happy until every adult in this country is required to carry at all times. Death is a very lucrative process when handled properly. Sick sick people they are. , 6 These students are just more unfortunate children meeting the stark reality of the adults who are supposed to be protecting them. These are young students for whom no adult can explain how the laws of this country - passed by adults, sanctioned by adult voters, and pressured into being by adult self-interest groups like the NRA \u2013 are in their, or anyone\u2019s, best interest. Welcome children to your future.\nSchool is supposed to be a place where you open up your mind to the phantasmagoric energy that fuels the physics of the universe and human behavior, to the language by which we describe those forces, and to the critical thinking by which we negotiate those forces, make informed decisions, and separate fact from opinion.\nBut here\u2019s what all of your education will ultimately come down to. A semiautomatic weapon like an AR-15 has the ability to level all of your critical thinking and learning into one deadly, overwhelming fact: in America your death is simply the price of freedom.\nThis is what you had better learn: 40 plus school shootings since 2000, and 3 of the 10 deadliest shootings have come in the last 5 months are now considered, not aberrations, but \u201cnormal.\u201d  You need to learn that the adults in your life will do nothing to change that fact, and that when you become an adult it is unlikely that you will do anything about it.\nHere\u2019s all you need to learn: it\u2019s a jungle out there; money and guns speak louder than words or ideas, or hopes or dreams.  This is America. , 6 If we follow the NRA' positions to a logical conclusion, the solution to school shootings is to arm all of the students; that they might defend themselves; against each other. Because, the only thing that can stop a bad Kindergartner with a gun would be a good Kindergartner with a gun?, 6 Should not the NRA be held responsible for a terrorist conspiracy against the people of the United States, and the Republicans in Congress and the President as enablers and abettors?  Far more mass killings have occurred over the years and recently because of ready availability of guns than because of fanatical Islamic fundamentalists.  But Trump and his cheerleaders on the right whip up hatred and ethnic resentment without doing anything to address the real dangers daily to innocent men, women, and children in America. See the maps and charts which make the nature of the mortal threat very clear:\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violen..., 6 America has officially hit rock bottom as a nation and a culture. Thanks GOP. This is entirely your fault. , 6 I am appalled by the commonplace bloodshed in America. The middle-class is complacent about gun violence until it explodes in their \"safe\" schools and neighborhoods. \n\nThe NRA is a well-financed lobby promoting the interests of gun manufacturers and retailers; I have no respect for elected officials who accept campaign contributions from the NRA.  Here in Ohio, people have the right to carry concealed deadly arms, and believe that the answer to gun violence is more guns. \n\nAren't we weary of listening to reporters adopt the right tone of concern as they interview teachers and parents and gather predictable 30-second responses? What is the point of the instant post-mortem 'analysis', with the time-lines, maps, and profiles of the shooters?  Do people comprehend the meaning of the mounting statistics of shooting events and victims? \n\nPerhaps they are too busy to deal with this. As long as gun violence doesn't impact them directly,  they believe they can continue to work hard and chase the \"American dream\".  Probably they think that spending more resources on security systems, drills, and armed guards in schools will insulate them from tragedy.\n\nThey certain don't see any link between their own consumption of violence and violence at large. Their steady diet of violent video games, television, films and violent sports-- no problem!Anyway, they convince themselves, surely victims of violence can be soothed by prayers and healed by counseling., 6 Why is that NRA Stooges like Marco Rubio never want to talk about bans on assault weapons and military style weapons?\n\nThey always say now is not the time to talk about it, but they will talk about mental health immediately of the killer, but banning the weapons used which are not made for hunting, but strictly for killing in high volumes, it's always too early to talk about.\n\nIt makes me wonder if Marco Rubio and the other NRA Stooges in the Republican party have to get their talking points from Wayne LaPierre first before they comment., 6 75% of the population do not own guns and we are being held hostage by a minority of voters , 6 Spent yesterday waiting to hear whether a family member made it out of school alive. Like the opioid epidemic, soon most of us will be personally touched by this kind of violence. For the sake of the student victims, the oftentimes mentally ill student perpetrators, and all of the collateral victims of the stress and fear, can't we come together as a nation and enact some sensible controls to limit access of these weapons to mature responsible people. Not asking much - just let's do something. All it takes for evil to prevail is for men of goodwill to do nothing. Doing nothing isn't working. , 6 Once again an outcast young man is trying to prove that he is\n\"not nobody\". Anger , then hatred of humanity leads to a bizarre act of \"Vandalism\" in which the perpetrator is ruining not statues or public buildings with obscene graffiti but random human targets. I still think as Margaret Thatcher famously said, \"We must deprive the terrorist of the oxygen of publicity\". A gag order on the investigation, trial sentencing and prompt  execution should help. If the perpetrator dies at the scene, he should remain anonymous.\nWe will never be able to preempt these shootings in our free society. If confronted by authorities for Facebook posts or purchase of guns/ammo , it is as likely to spur the shooter to act sooner, while he still can., 6 The term 'well regulated militia' must be legally re-defined to fit into the context of America 2018. This could include citizens who volunteer and register for the National Guard and who use their weapons solely within the scope of that activity. Sportsmen could also have provisions.\n\nMost Americans want this insanity with guns to stop now. Lobbying laws and limits must be enacted to bring the NRA to heel. As long as they are buying influence with Congress and Senators, the senseless killings will continue., 6 Second Amendment says: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"  Literally, the freedom guaranteed by the Second Amendment is the right of the people of each state to maintain a well-regulated militia.\n\nThe NRA has worked hard, and successfully, to convince the country to use its reading of that Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and unregulated.\n\nRegarding this interpretive shift, Conservative justice Warren Burger said, in 1991, that the Second Amendment \u201chas been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud\u2014I repeat the word \u2018fraud\u2019\u2014on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\", 6 \nBefore new and stricter laws can be enforced, it's the attitude that needs to be addressed and changed first and foremost.  \n\nFor the next couple of days and weeks, this most recent mass murder will be the focus of many articles, op-ed columns and news programs.  But soon, as the months gradually roll by, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School tragedy will be just another shooting in this country, other stories will headline the NYT and these murders and its aftermath will no longer be burning in people's minds, hearts and souls.  \n\nHow many more innocent people will be murdered before the numbness is replaced with continuous rage and determination for effective and lasting change in one's attitude and perspective when it comes to private citizens owning assault weapons like the semiautomatic AR-15 rifle?  That slogan of \"if you see something, say something\" does not only apply to terrorists.  This young man in Florida clearly displayed behaviors that warranted red flags on so many levels.   Perhaps the most critical time to step in and take action against an individual like this is BEFORE the carnage occurs. \n\nIf schools \"run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors\" since shootings have become common,  why don't people become more proactive, address and report the various warning signs to the proper authorities like this individual's unstable behavior clearly demonstrated over the past few months and years?, 6 No citizen who is not an active member of the armed forces needs, or should be permitted,  to purchase or use military assault weapons.\nThere is no reason for AR 15 rifles and ammunition to be commercially available., 6 Last night my son and I spoke about the main cause of this carnage, which was George W. Bush's decision not to renew the assault weapons ban. The Republican party has surrendered to the NRA, which is currently lobbying Congress to allow armor piercing bullets and other military grade weaponry to the masses. And all of this is done for money, which is the God weapons manufacturers worship foremost., 6 Slavery may be the first sin of this country, but the mass shootings are surely the second sin. \n\n One of the students commented yesterday that he wasn't surprised; that school shootings are pretty common, they happen and then it fades from the news.  Such a sad, but true assessment.\n\nThe prayers alone are not enough.  We need a full throated plan to control threats (taking away and preventing purchase of guns from those who are credibly threatening violence {something many of these shooters share}), and we need to get rid of the common gun used, the AR-15 style.  Honor those lost and hurt by doing something that matters.  , 6 Guns aren't going away. There seems to be no alternative at this point but to create a security infrastructure that mandates metal detectors, checkpoints, and secure boundaries around schools (at which there have already been many shootings this year) and other public spaces. Yes, it will cost a lot of money and yes, it will take away from the time for learning, but the cost of not doing so is too much to bear. Israel has been doing this for decades and we now need to emulate that process, on a much larger scale., 6 JUST HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?\nPeople shed tears not only for lives lost and hopes ruined.\nBut also for their inability to comprehend and come to grips.\nWe march backwards where money and guns speak louder than conscience., 6 I\u2019m Canadian.  In Canada, we have strict gun control laws.  When I was 8 years old, I was sexually abused by a 26 year old man, my mother rented a room in our house to for a couple of months.  Like a lot of childhood sexual abuse victims, I didn\u2019t tell anyone, and I didn\u2019t deal with it. It wrecked my life. Three years ago, at the suggestion of my girlfriend, I reported it to the police.  Doing so, opened up all the pain, and I began intensive therapy. I went through a very angry stage, where I wanted to find, and kill, the man who abused me. I hate violence, and I hate guns, but now I needed one. So I looked in to how to obtain a gun. I didn\u2019t know anyone who personally owned one, so borrowing was out of the question, and even if I did know anyone who owned a gun, I knew that the hoops one had to go through to get one, meant they would never lend me a gun anyway, as they\u2019d then be responsible for any crime I may commit with it. So I looked into those hoops. I knew that any background check, would turn up my report to the police, and then possibly a conversation with my therapist. My gun idea was dead in the water.\nI\u2019m so glad, because if I had been able to easily obtain a gun, I would have in the enraged state I was in. Whether I would\u2019ve had the guts to go find and kill the man who molested me, I don\u2019t know, but I think I might have. That would\u2019ve ruined my life.\nGun control worked in my case. I\u2019m glad I live in a country that regulates access to firearms. It\u2019s a good thing, 6 Nauseating to see Marco Rubio and Rick Scott saying Floridians mustn't rush to apportion blame. Both have taken millions of dollars from the NRA, and both have been endorsed by the NRA with A+ ratings for their support of lax gun control. , 6 If I were a parent in America right now I would seriously consider pulling my kid from school to home school him if I could afford to. Because this problem is so deeply entrenched, it goes way beyond gun laws. A kid ANNOUNCES his intentions to kill on social media, has a long history of violence or aggression AND the school had prepared for this. Still, 17 dead. The main questions now should be, why so, so many people, from the police to the FBI to teachers to other students, didn't take his posts seriously enough. And why your governor thinks its okay for a teenager, especially one with this history, to legally own a rifle., 6 \"this isn't the time to talk about gun control\"\n\nMaybe if this happens at the private schools that politicians and the wealthy send their kids to they might listen then., 6 Nothing will ever change until we care more about our children's lives than we do about our \"well regulated\" militia., 6 Elected officials response to this on-going carnage is pathetic, outrageous and unacceptable.\n\nIt's too easy in this country to get ar-15's and weapons like them. \n\nIt's irrelevant how much fun law abiding gun owners are having with these weapons. If removing them from society preserves the life of a single child it is well worth it., 6 Jeff Sessions, with his \u201cwe\u2019re going to work on it\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t let bad policy get in the way of solutions\u201d has just guaranteed that the status quo will remain firmly entrenched.\n\nThe majority of us, by a wide margin, want common-sense gun legislation. How is it \u201cbad policy\u201d to ban automatic rifles and other weapons of war? How is it \u201cbad policy\u201d to enforce existing gun laws and enact new ones as needed? How is it \u201cbad policy\u201d to take mental health seriously here? How is it \u201cbad policy\u201d to regulate the sales of all guns and ammunition, as a matter of public health and safety?\n\nThe midterms are roughly nine months away. Here is our chance to send a crystal clear message that enough is enough. Enough inaction. Enough lip service.  #NoMore.\n\nWe owe it to the victims and survivors, their families, our kids, ourselves, and this country. \n\nAgain \u2014 #NoMore., 6 Simply no one need an AR-15 Period!\nWhen will our political leaders say enough is enough?  We see #me too on labels and buttons, how about #NRA Come Get Me on the labels of senators and congressional members to pass common sense legislation that the American people support to legislate proper background check, sell guns to adults only (21+) and close the loopholes in current laws with regard to gun shows.  The USA has about 4% of the world population and about 42% of the guns in circulation.  , 6 It is time to recognize that every politican who has accepted money from the NRA, every member of the NRA board and every NRA member buy paying dues and allowing the NRA to continue in it's positions, every arms manufacturer especially of semi-automatic weapons and every employee of those manufacturers are, at the very least, accesories to thousands of murders and should be so charged. Many pro-gun conservatives talk a lot about responsibility -- fine. You are responsible for these deaths. Take legal responsibility and go to jail. , 6 It was said he killed animals, and displayed a frog he had killed on social media. When are we, as a society, going to take behavior like this as a huge red flag?, 6 Someone or something is blocking my comments on this article.  I posted this earlier.  Let's see if it shows up.\n\nThere was an eye-opening article in Bloomberg News the other day about Colt filing for bankruptcy and gun ownership in OUR United States.  The arcticle says, \"In 2014, 31 percent of American households reported owning a firearm, down from 47 percent in 1973, according to a report from National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.    Gun ownership has become more concentrated as a result, with a small sliver of gun owners owning a growing segment of America\u2019s firearms inventory, according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. These gun buyers have come to be known as \u201csuper owners\u201d and one study, conducted by Harvard and Northeastern universities, concluded that about half the guns in America are owned by only 3 percent of the adult population, with an average of 17 firearms each.\"\n\nI've long suspected this and am happy to see there is some good research on it.  \n\nGET GUNS OFF THE STREETS OF OUR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\n\nEVERY gun must be REGISTERED on a national database, state LICENSED and Fully Insured for LIABILITY.\n\nWE THE PEOPLE must DEMAND it.  NOW is the time.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-12/cerberus-s-remington-..., 6 President Trump just tweeted about the signs that the shooter was unstable and a potential threat and then admonishes people if they see something to say something.  So, all we get from him is a form of blaming the victims, and not one word about rational, constitutionally sound gun policies that would help keep us all safer.   , 6 Good God almighty.  Do not let Nicholas Cruz be a Mexican immigrant., 6 My thought and prayers are for the crusing defeat of the public officials supported by NRA. their position on this issue is evil, without intellect or soul. May they eternally inhabit the eighth circle of hell., 6 Why wasn't he stopped somewhere along the line? Why didn't his acquaintances issue dire warnings to authorities regarding social media posts, \"mental instability\", stalking the girl, gun obsession..? Was he under care/observation for all this? Can someone under 21 even possess such a rifle and multiple magazines, let alone purchase one (or many)? Was it registered, and were renewal and insurance requirements current? \"Everyone knew.\"\n If any good at all can possibly come from this ungodly one-more-time, it will be interventions put in place in spite of these weapons now being readily available, and requirements, requirements, requirements. Even a damned \"well-regulated militia\" can understand this for where we are now. Valentines Day, 2018.  , 6 If today a NK, a China, or for that matter any other country calls us stupid, we would need to look down and accept it. , 6 Another example of a STUPID and RECKLESS issueing gun permit to a BAD guy. How long do we have to wait until the government learn from their wrongdoing? The person who issued the license to the killer and his boss must be put in jail too for their responsibility in this case. They do not care enough who has the gun. What they care is selling gun permits. Semiautomatic guns must be banned., 6 Ban Assault Rifles NOW!!!!\nWhen is the March in Washington?  \n\nHow many more people have to die while politicians line their pockets from gun lobby?!?!?, 6 Maintain your righteous anger until the NRA is utterly destroyed. \n\nDo not stop until that moment. , 6 My condolences to the families of the victims. We need a Democrat in the Oval office! We need a total ban on all firearms! Enough is Enough!, 6 Watching our useless, cowardly politicians talk about everything except gun control.  As long as the NRA runs this country massacre like this will keep happening., 6 Call your congressman and tell him your tired of worrying  that your children/grandchildren  my come home from school in a body bag. Tell him that the deaths of these children are on the shoulders of him/her  and their fellow republicans. , 6  We have more gun owner than the total population ( 300 million American and 309 guns). Mass shooting and school shooting are very common in America now a days. We have more mass killings in America than any civilized country in the world. Why we are getting so barbaric? Our founding fathers wrote this 2nd amendment in the Bill of Rights in 1791, when there was no automatic machine gun like AR-15, no gun show, no drug and alcohol addiction problem and there was no social media. This amendment did not come from Jesus or God that it can not be touched. Where is well regulated militia. Gun is fun in some part of America . We hired 535 lawmakers who are good for nothing. They are scared of Putin backed NRA. We should fire them. How much blood to be shed and how many children have to be killed? , 6 Republican lawmakers will have you somehow believe that mental health was solely at the root of the shooting, almost implying the rest of humanity on this planet is any different. The sole difference: guns.\nUSA: 4% of world population, yet hold near 50% of guns in the world. Near 90 guns per 100 residents.\nEven worse though: GOP lawmakers now have the crutch that the FBI had been notified, and will immediately claim not enough was done from that department, repeating this rackety refrain they've been using to protect POTUS. We are now back to square one, like this shooting never happened. Tragic. , 6 Looks like the type Mr. Mueller was carrying in the photo of hi in Vietnam.....From the battlefield to the back yard.......\nThere's no way these guns should be available to the public., 6 1-Broken homes (divorce rate over 50% among married couples)\n2-Children of one or no parents, emotionally damaged for life\n3- Denial of the existence of moral imperatives\n4-Availability of assault rifles in the millions, even for teenagers\n5-No gun control rules\n6-Poor interpretation of Amendment 2 by the evil society known as NRA\n7-Greedy firearms manufacturers, who care only for the 'bottom line'\nAnd the US is worried about Jihadist terrorist, when the true terror is right here, in us, the US citizens, 6 now the deniers begin---the this-didn't-happen folks will call it a government hoax, 6 The NRA has blood on its hands again., 6 Condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this tragedy. After Las Vegas i waited until it was not too soon then I sent some thoughts and said some prayers like many others did. But it happened again.\nI wonder if NRA types would consider swapping their excessive gun rights for the life of their own child if it happened to their own son or daughter.., 6 And Lucifer said, \"I will give you the most powerful country on earth, the most powerful military, unlimited and enviable wealth, and you shall reign over minorities, and the natives of the land, BUT, you must regularly sacrifice your children to me in a hail of gunfire.  I will take children of all ages, of any age, so long you sacrifice your children to me.\"  And the leaders of the afflicted land got together and signed this pact.  Each time their children got murdered in homes, schools, and colleges, they look at the ceiling, shook their sub-human heads, and tweeted insincere words of condolence.\n\n17 people were murdered in a Florida high school yesterday.  20 kindergartners were murdered in Sandy Hook in Connecticut.  \n\nIt's February 15 and we have 18 school shootings already this year.\nStill, they come from all over the world, yearning to be a part of the American offering. Lucifer reigns.  We are all a part of the pact., 6 It's unsafe to live anywhere in America. Period.  Go to church? BAM!  Go to school? BAM!  Go to work? BAM!  Go to a concert? BAM! Go to a nightclub? BAM! \n\nAnyone anywhere who has a bone to pick, a grudge, a sense of needing to get even just has to walk into any gun shop and buy an assault weapon and BAM!\n\nYour children's futures are at stake and everybody shrugs and waits for the next one.  I don't get it., 6 So a disturbed, 17 year old can legally be a heavily armed member of Florida's \"well regulated militia\". Presumably, Gov. Scott is their CO so I guess he's responsible?\nNRA lobbyists and their legislative stooges should be tried for manslaughter., 6 'Thoughts and prayers,' as expected are is the only response from the GOP, the NRA, and 45., 6 When did America decide that the bloody bodies of innocent American children were just the cost of doing business?, 6 I think my odds of being gunned-down in my classroom are now higher than those of my retiring with a full pension.  This is not snark.  This is frightening.\nI chose to be a schoolteacher, not join the military.\nAnd my poor daughter.  She is required to go to school until she is 16.  She is a straight-A student, a good girl.  We are both victims waiting to happen.\nThe gun-owners have won., 6 This slaughter in our schools is brought to us by the members of the Republican Party and the NRA, not just be their leadership. By their actions, they encourage and endorse these shootings. Their Second Amendment rights do not trump my grandchildren\u2019s and the Parkland victims\u2019 right to live. There have been 18 school shootings since the first of the year, just 6 weeks. 7 of these school shootings had 3 or more victims. The slaughter of innocents has got to stop. , 6 Terribly sad, tragic AND disgusting. To the arms rights proponents: Where were all the people with weapons to protect those killed and attacked? The second amendment apparently isn't fulfilling what it originally meant to. If Americans insist on keeping /having weapons, then they have to accept these mass shootings as a consequence. Lastly: How sick and tasteless of the NY TIMES to include a piece about the weapon employed in this shooting. The models and makers of weapons used in shootings like this are diligently mentioned in almost every article in the TIMES. That only glorifies the means of the deed and is like a heinous/cynical form of advertising for a product and cause, I believe society doesn't need., 6 It is really hard to believe that USA government has not made any changes regarding weapons purchases regulation.political action is the most needed to put their fingers on the right path to stop theses tragedies ,as the daily telegraph was put into its headlines \"Florida shooting: America's gun crisis will never end until its liberals learn to make peace with gun culture\"\nTOM HARRIS, 6 I don't know what's left to say.  Maybe we should look at the link between quality education and gun violence.  Most teachers already work so hard and sacrifice so much to provide their students with a good education.  Do they have to take the job knowing they may sacrifice their life as well?\n\nFor those of you who think teachers are overpaid and are awarded too much time off, I challenge you to work a teacher's job for a year and tell me that.\nThey face this threat every day.  I know, my wife is a social worker in a NY school.  \n\nWe're in danger of losing potentially great teachers to the every-day threat of gun violence in our schools.  Teachers should not have to drive to their job every morning wondering if this is the day it happens in their school.\n\nThis sickens me.  We need to vote out the soul-less cretins who gorge themselves on NRA blood money., 6 The NRA is right. Thanks to their efforts over the past 25 years, there's no point in enacting gun control legislation. Too much lethal firepower is in the hands of too many individuals, and the obsession with guns, now enshrined in the Constitution by the Supreme Court, is too pervasive in America. Gun control legislation can't be effective in this environment. \n\nIf Sandy Hook didn't result in action, nothing will. \n\nWe just have to live, and die, with our national depravity., 6 A tragedy of epic proportions, but only one of many similar ones.\nThis morning, the Dotard will \"address\" the nation - he will read from a prepared script, trying to feign empathy for this latest apocalypse. Lip service. Nothing will be done to help prevent future slaughters, just as nothing has been done following the others.\nNote here that Trump was a troubled child (see: https://www.npr.org/2015/11/10/455331251/this-is-where-donald-trump-play.... He was sent to military school by his rich parents, undoubtedly at the insistence of the Kew-Forest School. Had he not been, this challenged brat might have been just like Nikolas Cruz. Now, he lives in the White House, to the dismay and disgrace of all Americans. I guess the fake bone spurs that made him a draft dodger, but failed to keep him from marching or playing football, added to his disdain for rules and law.\nWatch his speech, and assess for yourself. A man without a moral compass has no compassion for others. His words, if seemingly significant, are meaningless in deed., 6 Where is the outrage on the right, ban guns., 6 This week we will hear, \"This is not the time to discuss gun control.\" Why is this not the time? When will enough innocent citizens die? It is high time our senators and congressmen finally stand up to the NRA!  The NRA is holding our country's leaders hostage! Enough heartbreaking news! It's time to ban semi-automatic rifles for everyone but the military. The United States alone allows this to happen., 6 Think not only of the dead.  Hopefully, they are now at peace.  Think of the wounded and the survivors who were there, who witnessed this devastation.  Think of those whose recovery from their wounds will take lots of time and lots of money.  Think of the families.   Many of these will be impacted by this for the rest of their lives.\nAnyone who continues to vote for anyone with anything other than an F rating from the NRA is complicit in this carnage., 6 I have an idea for sensible gun control:  you can only own a gun if you are part of a well-regulated militia.  That means one that trains regularly, wears uniforms, and can kick you out if you have mental issues.\n\nHow could the NRA object to that?  Is is, after all, what the Second Amendment actually says., 6 Trump offered \"prayers and condolences\" for the dead and their families, while all the while, he and his fellow Republicans are ramping up for the 2018 and 2020 elections with the largesse of the NRA and its supporters. \n\nAnd again, another crazy American white guy, with easy access to buying arms, thanks to America's lack of gun control laws, was the killer -- not a foreign devil, as xenophobes fear.  \n\nWe're the only Western country that permits weapon ownership. Even second and third world countries,  have annual gun deaths in the double or single digits.  \n\nThe U.S. has more than 10,O00 gun deaths annually.  While South America does beat the American gun death rate by percentage of population, it's not a point of pride to declare that we're less blood soaked than Colombia. \n\nOur Constitution gave us the right to bear arms against a menacing foreign or domestic government.   We could hunt with those flintlock rifles,  too. \n\nNow, we cannot form a militia powerful enough to fight foreign attack or a U.S. government bent on breaking Democracy.  Hunters can use shotguns or bow and arrow.  The need for handguns or military firepower is an anachronism. \n\nThe U.S. should copy Australia, which,  by forbidding and buying back arms, totally eliminated its gun death problem.\n\nThe U.S. has the most trigger-happy,  bloodthirsty population in the world. Nero liked a lot of gore, too. This desire to kill, and the quick availability to do so, boosted by the NRA, is madness. , 6 The state of Florida is going to pay for funerals, I have a 3 questions. 1. Does this relieve the law makers of guilty? 2. Is this income that must be declared in Federal taxes and possibly state taxes? 3. Is it a nice coffin?, 6 I keep thinking of the headline in the Onion from a couple of years ago: \"Nothing will prevent this from happening, says only nation where this happens regularly\"\nStill true., 6 There is a solution to this problem- vote straight Blue for candidates who support getting private money out of our elections. We need politicians who serve us, not NRA lobbyists., 6 The Supreme Court has found that the 2nd Amendment does NOT give all Americans the right to own guns with no restrictions.  The majority opinion in District of Columbia v Heller, which did an unseemly end-run around the actual language in the 2nd Amendment, also includes this:  \"...Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited...  it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\"  The opinion goes to on highlight the many restrictions that are 'allowable' under the Second Amendment.  This majority opinion was written by conservative Antonin Scalia, who goes on to enumerate the many instances where restrictions are permissible.  Please check the voting records of all politicians at the state and federal level.  Our new Republican congress is now trying to remove state's rights (yep- the same hypocrites who believe in state's rights when it suits them) to create regulation.  I won't live in a state with permissive gun laws, and I won't even visit one that allows concealed carry.    \n\nAs someone else noted, perhaps widely publicizing the laws of each state and the gun crime rate will move consumers to boycott those that care little for the safety of the average citizen.  These hypocrites sued D.C. over strict gun controls-  yet won't allow guns in the Capitol building!  As a teacher, I am beyond offended at the idea that I should have to arm myself to do my job... we are a sick society., 6 There were hundreds of students at the school and one deranged gunman. According to the NRA and gun advocates \"The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun\" so if every student that wasn't deranged in that school yesterday had a gun this tragedy may have been minimized to say only 1 or 2 deaths before the deranged gunmen was shot to death by a few dozen students in proximity to him. The solution to mass shootings is simple. Mandatory gun ownership beginning when a child enters school. While accidental deaths may rise and schoolyard scuffles may escalate into shootouts with dozens of deaths at least the kids will be able to stop \"bad guys with a gun.\", 6 IMHO, this is a needle in the haystack problem with no solution.\n\n1980s: Reagan releases the mentally disturbed on the public. A needle in that haystack of crazy people are paranoid schizotypals. A handful of these start the mass shooting phenomenon (e.g. 'going postal').\n\n1989: Prozac, the first of the SSRIs is launched. Among the millions who take these drugs are paranoid schizotypals. Among the haystack of all SSRI users, including a great many paranoid schizotypals, a small number of the latter begin their reign of terror on the nation.\n\nSSRIs reduce empathy and produce a feeling of well being. Give a paranoid schizotypal an SSRI and what happens? Maybe the fearful, hiding sick person starts feeling confident in his paranoid beliefs, and gives him boldness to act out against his \"tormentors\".\n\nOf course, this story hasn't even mentioned AR-15s, bump stocks, etc.\n\nWhat a disaster. If what I've written is even only half-explanatory, we ain't getting out of this anytime soon. Especially when the POTUS is DSM-tagged himself., 6 We have met the enemy and it is US.  How has Homeland Security helped our children and innocent Americans who die in mass shootings on a regular basis now?  How?  Guns.  Not bombs, not terrorists from another country.  US and the NRA and everyone who supports NO GUN CONTROL., 6 For me it was Sandy Hook.  Tiny first graders gunned down like they didn't matter.  They do matter, but not to anyone who makes the laws and not to the NRA or to lawmakers who oppose gun control and care more about their NRA ratings than about the lives of first graders or anyone else who has no business on the receiving end of an AR-15.  As to that, no one has any business on the receiving end of an AR-15.  But these 17 students will be among hundreds, maybe thousands, killed in the next 10 years and the story will always be the same: nothing will change.  Congrats NRA.  You win., 6 I would like to remind the Democrats that when they controlled the house, the senate and the white house, they did nothing in 2008.  But thank you for the threats., 6 Stop sending your children to school!  The nation has FAILED its parents and students, and ultimately all its citizens on this issue. Until these weapons are removed from society---Keep them home!  Maybe that will make our negligent national government finally act., 6 I just read the Interpreter comparing gun violence in the us with other countries.  The last paragraph of that article read-\n\u201cIn retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate,\u201d Dan Hodges, a British journalist, wrote in a post on Twitter two years ago, referring to the 2012 attack that killed 20 young students at an elementary school in Connecticut. \u201cOnce America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.\nWhat's interesting is that America has not decided this 85% of Americans believe in sensible gun control law and yet we can't get our congress to act. This is getting ridiculous how many kids have to die? What does the percentage have to be? 90% ? 95% ?  To get 85% of a population of 350,000,000 to agree on anything is next to impossible.  It just shows how much money in our politics has ruined our system. It's no longer what the majority wants it's who can pay me the most to stay in office.  It's despicable, wrong and makes me incredible sad for this country that I love.   , 6 And somehow the Federal Government wants to prohibit cannabis because it is a \"gateway drug\"? They don't want us to be healthy mentally or physically, they want us to be sick so that they can exploit and blame us for everything. \n\nI am angry and cry every day. , 6 There was an eye-opening article in Bloomberg News the other day about Colt filing for bankruptcy and gun ownership in OUR United States.  The arcticle says, \"In 2014, 31 percent of American households reported owning a firearm, down from 47 percent in 1973, according to a report from National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.

NOW is the time.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-12/cerberus-s-remington-..., 6 School districts are still to lackadaisical as it pertains to safe an orderly schools. The district I live in is the largest in the state of Georgia and while school resource officers are clearly present on campuses, I don\u2019t see school identifications being implemented and when you address these concerns with administrators, it\u2019s ignored. At least two of the shootings this year were students who walked on campus unawares. They were able to blend in. Shameful! How many more shootings and murders have to occur before school boards and superintendents get wise. My heart hurts for the parents and family members of another senseless tragedy. , 6 I think the media should stop reporting on mass shootings. The country and lawmakers clearly do not want to do anything to stop the problem. And as a society we just need to live with the idea we may very well end up dead by gun violence because we value gun ownership. The endless reporting just gives people more ideas about how to do it and how to get famous., 6 Here we are again.  Mourning the dead. Dead children once again. We are once again gathered to Scream about gun control, both for and against.  Still debating amongst one another as yet another stark example of the consequences of this dangerous mix happens.  This gun lust we seem to have here in the USA is paramount to unleashing lions into the city.  Make it legal.  Right.  We obviously do not care when it comes from our paranoia.  You know the thing about the gun advocate argument FOR allowing deadly weapons to exist in public is more at defending themselves from other people who have guns.  Sickening beyond words this nation has become, from the top to the very bottom., 6 I read that this is the 18th school shooting in 2018. That number occurring over a decade should be enough to shock any legislator into taking substantive action, but in the first 45 days? \n\nSo are we done yet with doing nothing or are we just going to reset the clock till the next one? Anyone taking money from or supporting the NRA is responsible for the continuing inaction. The data on gun deaths in the US relative to other developed countries clearly shows the relationship with the number of guns per capita, both of which are higher than in any other country.\n\nI wonder how many future shooters have uttered \"Guns don't kill people, people kill people\" to the clerk while purchasing their weapon?\n\nFrom \u201cViolent Death Rates: The United States Compared to Other High-Income OECD Countries, 2010,\u201d by Erin Grinshteyn, PhD, and David Hemenway, PhD in The American Journal of Medicine, Volume 129, Issue 3 (March 2016)\n\nThe study reveals some stark truths about living and dying in the United States. When compared to other high-income nations, as an American you are:\n\n    -Seven times more likely to be violently killed\n    -Twenty-five times more likely to be violently killed with a gun\n    -Six times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gun\n    -Eight times more likely to commit suicide using a gun\n    -Ten times more likely to die from a firearm death overall, 6 I know of many troubled young men here in Canada who are capable of doing the same thing - but the government has tried to make their chances of getting their hands on automatic firearms very small - especially here in Quebec where 30 years ago 14 female students were murdered by a disgruntled young man. Shootings still happen here but at least people are still horrified enough to demand even more gun control. Americans have accepted that their children are not safe., 6 It's time for the NY Times and other newspapers to publish a list of politicians and how much money they receive from the gun lobby.  I mean publish it everyday, front page, day after day after day.  Follow the money.  Put the politicians who take money from pro gun groups on the front page, and do it relentlessly.  Make them ashamed, publicly ashamed.  Maybe that will move some of them., 6 Columbine was shocking, Sandy Hook was ghastly, Parkland is not-again.\nWe spend millions trying to fight Islamic terrorists but nothing on the true domestic terrorists, those American citizens who can get their hands on guns whether legally or illegally to shoot them off at random crowds.\nWe put up bureaucratic processes to screen out voter fraud and we do nothing about preventing gun massacres which are now just part of our daily news. When will those in government be brave enough to do something about this?, 6 NRA - Sole existence is to make money.  Incomprehensible how they can get away with this - bribing politicians to sustain their existence.  All politicians that take contributions from the NRA should be identified.  And then let them explain why they support the NRA - and let's not accept the boilerplate \"gobbledegook\".   Glad to see Remmington file for bankruptcy.   , 6 We point fingers at the NRA and politicians. But they are like the dog guarding the yard behind the picketed fence. They are there as a reflection and manifestation of our thoughts. \n\nUntil American citizens vote out of office the politicians who are afraid to take a stand on the issue of gun violence, we are complicit as well. , 6 This horror reminds us that the things holding young people together are FAMILY and the crucial assistance of the Judeo-Christian ethic. \n\n    This monster had a father somewhere. The way society is supposed to work, the father sticks AROUND until the kids are grown. It is ALL on you, dads.\n         I understand this Mr. Cruz had a foster mother who had passed away last year, so the only thing holding him to society was a friend's family. \n\nWill there be a separate apology piece from the NY Times admitting its wholehearted commitment to encouraging rage and full-on hate in young Americans simply because their political side lost an election? , 6 I understand this individual was reported to the FBI months before this shooting since he had declared on social media his intention to shoot up a school. I hope some enterprising reporter will follow up on that lead. If we report these people to law enforcement, and then nothing happens, what protection do we have?, 6 The FBI ignored a serious warning about Cruz.  This is another of a string of FBI failures.   The FBI ignored warnings about Arab flight students before 911, the Boston Bombers, the San Bernardino killers, the Orlando killer and the Chelsea bomber.  They lost track of Salman Mateen according to Loretta Lynch.  Thank God that Trump had her arrested and incarcerated.\n\nMaybe instead of being a tool for HRC and Jeb Bush investigating  Trump they should do their jobs and protect the American people.  \n\nOur intelligence agencies need to be reorganized and held accountable., 6 As a public school teacher 30 miles away from this horror, I can't help but worry that this will some how be blamed on the school. They didn't lock all their doors, or they shouldn't have expelled him, or there needs to be guns on campus. People, there is very little we can do to protect your child. It's scary and true., 6 My condolences go out to the families and friends who have lost loved ones.  Another senseless massacre.  Many say it is evil that perpetrates these acts, but this is a simplistic answer for those who don't want to face the truth.  This was a horrible senseless act carried out by a troubled 19-year-old with an assault rifle.  Eliminate the assault rifle and all your left with is a troubled youth.   We probably have our fair share of troubled youth in Canada as well., 6 The teacher who was interviewed afterwards said it all. Paraphrasing 'We did everything right and according to the drills. We were let down by the government\". These tragedies will continue as long as politicians continue to lick the boots of the NRA. The NRA is not a voice for thinking gun-owners, but rather the cynical  manipulators on behalf of the gun manufacturers. It still comes down to feeble politicians who prefer to receive the dirty dollars instead of standing up for the rights of all.\nWith such a tragic story, I hate to nitpick the journalist's story, but Parkland is most definitely not a suburb of Ft Lauderdale. A quick glance at Google maps would have simply determined this., 6 The single best preventive measure a school can take to preserve the lives of their students is to have classroom doors without glass which lock from the inside and are kept locked when classes are in session.  Yesterday's reports identified the Parkland HS as having very high marks for its security system.  However this morning it was reported that once the school had an active shooter\na \"code red\" was issued and doors were locked, I expect some with dead students inside.  We seem still unable to take automatic weapons out of the hands of murderers but we can do a much better job of protecting our children in classrooms., 6 Cultures can become sick, and right now it's clear to anyone watching that the U.S. has a stinking rot that is rapidly metastasizing. The daily mass shootings are just one symptom. Our entire social order is being unraveled. If the Republican party weren't so culpable it would be easy to imagine some James Bondian evil genius working behind to scenes to destabilize and ruin the country. But of course I guess there IS Putin doing just that. With the Republicans and NRA functioning as his inside operatives. \n\nA recent study in the journal Health Affairs concluded that the United States has become \u201cthe most dangerous of wealthy nations for a child to be born into.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately there are millions of perfectly sane parents who are trapped in the US and and would gladly take their children and leave if they could find a country that would give them residency and allow them to work. I have to wonder how long it will be until the rest of the world starts granting political refugee status to Americans? At the rate things are going it won't be long., 6 Where are the parents of this murderer? How did he have access and the money for such deadly weapons? Can we keep parents accountable? , 6 What would it take to keep us from engaging in an orgy of feigned enthusiasm every time there is a massacre. Probably state or federal law would be needed. There is little question that many of these are copycat assaults and the huge news reaction is likely a major motivator., 6 And still people sing, \"God bless America!\"  America doesn't deserve His blessing.  What they should be singing is God forgive America., 6 Another mass shooting in our nation, tragically they seem to be a regular occurrence. Lawmakers do nothing about it. Gun rights advocates hide behind the Second Amendment. And loathsome N.R.A. lobbyists continue to funnel millions of dollars to our spineless politicians. It\u2019s time for a reality check America - this is no longer about \"the right to bear arms\" - it\u2019s about profits for gun manufacturers who are making billions while our nation\u2019s citizens continue to be slaughtered.\n\nHere\u2019s a bold idea - let\u2019s repeal the Second Amendment! It\u2019s an outdated relic that was written after the American revolution at a time when our founders were concerned about the return of tyrannical government (and \u201cguns\u201d were single shot muskets). They could never have imagined the kind of carnage today\u2019s automatic rifles can inflict in mere seconds.\n\nThe United States is one of the few countries in the world that allows its citizens to legally purchase and own these types of weapons \u2013 it's MADNESS. I say it\u2019s time to put an end to that - abolish the Second Amendment and let\u2019s put an end to this odious profit from murder., 6 A few days ago a boy who fled the war in Iraq was shot in the head by a handgun that went off in his classmate's backpack.  He survived 12 years of war in Iraq only to be shot sitting in school in Los Angeles.  What was the response?  Arrest and charge the 12-year-old child who was carrying the gun.  Yes, let's blame the children.  Arrest them and put them in jail. Let's take classroom time to teach the children how to respond to a shooter in the classroom.  \n\nWhatever we do, the arms/gun industry must not be held to account for flooding our nation with weapons, and flooding our legislature with their ill-gotten gains.  \n\nAnd meanwhile our POTUS tweets about how in his short time in office he already, personally, has improved airline safety!!  , 6 Put the legality of assault weapons on a referendum in the next national election. , 6 I had a doctor who once told me that often, patients come to him only after their pain has gotten \"bad enough.\" Up to that point, they have been suffering with pain that they could have alleviated or even cured.  With every shooting, I think, this is it, this is \"bad enough\" for us to create some gun regulation. Or at least open up research and debate!  Somehow, the shooting passes, and another shooting happens, and it's still not \"bad enough.\" Congressmen get shot in a field, but that's not bad enough. Students in elementary schools, high schools, people in night clubs, churches, music festivals. More and more casualties, more and more families devastated, if not by death, then by disability and, so ironic, bankruptcy from the health coverage withheld from them.  Every shooting a horrific, brutal act of violence.  When, when will it be \"bad enough\"?  How can it not have been \"bad enough\" already? We possess some of the greatest minds and innovations in the world and yet we are unwilling -- because that's what it is, UNWILLINGNESS -- to solve the problem of repetitive, useless violent death in our nation. A problem that has been solved by every other industrialized nation in the world. Shame on us. We do this to ourselves. , 6 My heart also goes out to the poor kids and their families.\nOtherwise, this: Donald J. and the NRA, how many kids did you kill today?\n\nI recently saw the two Blade Runner movies.  Steel and glass, no trees or grass or live animals, everybody with a weapon ready to take each other out.  I think that's the \"great\" America that Trump and the NRA want for us.  Hell no, we won't go!, 6 I am so, so, so sad. Until yesterday those kids were just doing their own thing, likely sad about these things that happen in the world...and then it happened there. It's really beyond understanding. It's beyond the human mind.\n\nMeanwhile you have the news focusing on Trump's porn star affair and now the Porter fellow. Really? Up until yesterday one of the biggest outrages was the proposal to cut food stamps, but now, another sad, sad tragedy that will occupy the media and politicians' minds for a few days, only to return to shallow items like Trump's affairs. It is so sad and disappointing. I feel hopeless.\n\nThe suspect clearly had mental problems, to say the least. His own mother had to call the cops on him regularly. People PREDICTED that he would be the one to do something like this. And yet, each time, he was kicked OUT of school and never approached with the HELP he very much needed. He was such a red flag and instead of being addressed he was avoided, which I don't blame anyone for. But at the same time, that's clearly an issue. He was left to his own devices, which, by the way, were assault weapons. Again, people knew he had these. And he got them legally. LEGALLY. How is this okay? I'm just rambling because I'm at a loss for words. How? How? When the HELL will the politicians do something that's actually good for the people?, 6 Did mercenary Hannity, battleax Pirro,and FIX News blame this tragedy on Obama yet?, 6 Protecting the rights of consumers purchasing a weapon no civilian should own.\nCan you go to Hell for apathy?, 6 What is going to take when the country starts to look at people like Wayne LaPierre of the NRA as guilty as these murders, he and his lobby has as much blood on his hands as these mentally deranged killers., 6 I think it's time to look at the Wayne LaPierre's, NRA Lobbyists, Gun Lobbyist, all of these proponents of fighting against background checks, fighting the banning of assault style weapons or any military style weapons being sold to the general public, I think it's time to look at these people in the same way we look at the degenerates and child pornographers in our society., 6 NYTimes, please publish the donations to each and every congressperson and senator from the NRA, along with the NRA membership status of everyone in the President's White House reality show.  We need information so we can vote against., 6 I have an idea.  The NYT no longer publishes comments promising \"thoughts and prayers\" in the wake of these mass shootings.  Only publish promises to regulate sale of firearms., 6 Let anyone bring any weapon any time into the House, the Senate and the White House.  , 6 One thing all shooters have in common is lack of appropriate nurturing in their homes as well as symptoms of mental illness (or history of anger issues) obvious to all and nothing was done to address the shooters behavior by \u201cthe system\u201d...\n\nOne shooter got his automatic weapon from his educated mother cache of guns!!!\n\nToronto is looking pretty good right now..., 6  I often wonder when some lawyer with a nose for a real, Clarence Darrow type fight, will decide to head a class action suit between the American people and the NRA. If Morris Dees can bankrupt the KKK and seize it's property over the murder of two, innocent black people - a nation can sue the facilitators of schoolyard slaughter. Whoever that lawyer may be, he will change life in the United States and gain a place in legal history.\nYour right to own a gun is protected.

The bondsman alerted the FBI, emailing a screenshot to the bureau's tips account. He flagged the comment to YouTube, which removed it from the video.\nAgents with the bureau's Mississippi field office got back to him \"immediately,\" Bennight said, and conducted an in-person interview the following day, on Sept. 25. \"They came to my office the next morning & asked me if I knew anything about the person,\" Bennight told BuzzFeed News. \"I didn't. They took a copy of the screenshot & that was the last I heard from them.\"\nFBI agents contacted Bennight again Wednesday, after a 19-year-old named Nikolas Cruz opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in South Florida, killing 17 people.\nAround 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday \u2014 minutes after Cruz was taken into custody by police in Broward County \u2014 Special Agent Ryan Furr with the FBI's Miami field office called Bennight & left him a voicemail.

The office did did not respond to multiple calls or emails Wednesday night.\"\nA failure to followup\u2026, 6 The Republicans are responsible for this slaughter, as well as every other slaughter to date. Other countries have solved this problem, but we can't because the Republicans are standing in the way. On every single issue they are setting back the country and diminishing the quality of our life. Vote them out. Every single one of them. Either they are stupid, cowards, or corrupt., 6 One word.

The more accurate label is: accomplice., 6 \"land of the free and home of the...guns don't kill people...{specious}\", 6 And this President says this is all about mental health, how disingenuous of this pathetic excuse of a President when mental illness has been around forever.  They have mental illness in every country, yet they don't have the constant mass shootings that we have here.  The problem Mr. Ignorant President is...GUNS.  You are so deep into the cavity of the NRA that you will never ever say this is about GUNS.  And Mr. President, if mental illness is your convenient excuse for this, why are you President since you obviously have mental health issues?  Why then, should the man with the biggest guns (our nuclear arsenal) be in charge of it?  Truth is, you are bought and owned like a cheap toy by the NRA., 6 We need the Republican Congress to show up, don't you have kids at home? When will your greed end? How many more people have to die before you stand up? It is abdominal that you are in bed with NRA, an organization that will never be satisfied. NRA and the Republicans, this is on you!, even your favorite sacred book cannot redeem you., 6 No sympathy from our dear psycho \"leader\" in the Oval office.

Somebody should do something about it. , 6 Atten: Donald Trump/Paul Ryan/Mitch McConnell\n\nWhat is your answer to this problem???

They have blood on their hands.  They are responsible for not caring, for not doing anything to stop this violence, How many more have to die before they do something to stop the killing?  Thoughts and prayers won't do it.  One Republican congressman got shot last year and survived and they all went ballistic.  17 school children get killed and they send their thoughts and prayers and that's it.  We need a new Congress that is willing to stand up to the NRA and get rid of guns!  , 6 OK, let's pray, hold a candlelight vigil, and wrap this thing up, folks., 6 In 1929, seven gangsters were shot to death in Chicago in a Valentine's Day massacre that has, and apparently always will, live in infamy. Nearly a century later, twice that many innocent students are slaughtered and the story will be cold in less than a week. A death toll of 17 doesn't mean much these days because it, quite literally, happens most every day.\n\nCapone was nothing compared to the NRA and cowards in Congress who won't do a darn thing about this horrid crimson tide. Remember bump stocks? Yawn. Still legal. That was yesterday's news, and the killing continues via the barrel of weapons that Founding Fathers could scarcely imagine. Anyone want to take a bet on how many nanoseconds it would take Jefferson and Washington and Franklin et al to do something about this? They did, after all, risk their necks to birth this nation. Does anyone seriously think they would countenance the blood bath that spawns from an outdated and poorly worded part of a Constitution that, from the jump, was intended to be a malleable document that could be adjusted as problems  became apparent?\n\nRepeal the Second Amendment., 6 we can and must do better. No one - NO ONE- other than law enforcement needs an assault weapon that is solely designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible.\n\nShame on us!, 6 And our elected officials continue to do nothing. Pathetic., 6 Rick Scott's message - oh, it's just that old \"pure evil\" rearing its ugly head again.  Nothing we can do about it.\n\nAnd, apparently, our children's lives are simply the sacrifice we are willing to make so every fool can have a gun or guns he or she does not need to have., 6 If Trump is serious about reducing violence by deporting people, he should start with angry white males and leave the Dreamers alone.  The process could begin with any recent purchasers of semi-automatics or high capacity magazines.  But wait!!  Maybe we could just ban these weapons of mass murder?  Nah.  It's money that matters most., 6 Enough.\nJust repeal an outdated ridiculous part of our constitution-the second amendment.\n\nThere is ZERO reason for any citizen to own a gun. NEEDING a gun shows mental illness all on its own. I am sick of the relentless victims that come into our emergency rooms....and ALL gun kills--not just the AR-15!\n\nCOWARDS IN CONGRESS-REPEAL THE SECOND AMENDMENT NOW!, 6 I would like the Executives at the NRA, and the politicians who are in their pockets, to at least help out in the aftermath of school shootings.  How about they come out of their shiny, sanitary, luxurious offices, get on a plane, and volunteer.  Give them buckets of bleach water, gloves, and let them wipe up the blood of the children and teachers.  Let them repair the broken windows and plaster over the bullet holes.  Let them go to the store and prepare dinners for the families of the victims.  Let them arrange for quality psychological help for the survivors.  Let them do it each and every time a child or a teacher is murdered at school by a person carrying an assault weapon.  , 6 I'm sick of the phony outrage from the politicians, mainly in the Republican Party and this Whitehouse, who continue to receive huge donations from the NRA and the Gun Lobby, they all are bathed in the blood of these young children and victims of the epidemic of mass shootings in this country.\n\nOh, President Trump said the shooter was mentally unstable, NO KIDDING, give the man a prize, ANY IDIOT CAN FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. \n\nThere is no way any Senator, Congressman, President or anyone one with some sense of decency can make a case for not having enhanced background checks, and an absolute banning of all military style weapons and high capacity rounds to be sold to the public, and put an end to this crazy carry gun law; under no circumstance should any firearm be allowed to be sold to the general public that is comparable with what the Military or Law Enforcement use.\n\nWhat is wrong with the political leadership in this country, is receiving money from the NRA and Gun Lobby so important?     \n\nMaybe any politicians for Federal Office should be banned from receiving any donations from the NRA, Gun Lobby or Munitions manufacturers?\n\nTell Donald Trump, I don't care about illegal aliens, immigrants or undocumented people from Mexico, South America, Canada or a stupid wall, WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS THE UNPROVOKED EPIDEMIC OF MASS SHOOTINGS IN THIS COUNTRY IN SCHOOLS, CONCERTS, PUBLIC EVENTS, THAT IS  WHAT I CARE ABOUT., 6 Looks like some of you got a clue: http://thepoliticalcarnival.net/2013/01/12/cartoons-of-the-day-the-secon..., 6 If I am a Russian who wants to destabilize the USA, I am supporting Trump, Republicans, and the NRA. , 6 If I were a parent of a child of high school age, I would homeschool them. Today's high schools have become too dangerous for kids and there is an endless supply of mentally ill boys/men who get guns and will kill them., 6 Jesus wept at the tomb of his friend, Lazarus.\n\nPoliticians essentially walk by dead children and never shed a tear.\n\nJesus raised Lazarus from the dead.\n\nPoliticians essentially throw dirt on the coffins of dead children killed by assault rifles.\n\nNothing more need be said., 6 There comes a point when \"commenting\" should stop and action begin.  Have we become a nation of commenters? Politicians?  Newscasters? Police? The public? Commenting makes us feel better and perhaps makes us feel like something will be done.  Obviously commenting has not been enough. Action must be taken:  Vote politicians out of office.  Make the government aware of our concerns. March on Washington. Pass sane gun laws., 6 Tragic? Of course - like so the many other similar instances in America. Will Congress now enact legislation to help stop powerful weapons being acquired by just about anyone? Of course not.\n\nWhilst there remain massive campaign costs, candidates will continue to gather funds from wherever they can and this includes the NRA. So Congress talks a lot and does nothing. \n\nI don't wish this on them, but if some nut entered the Senate and opened fire with an automatic weapon on our legislators, would this finally make them realize that America deserves better than this? , 6 I grew up with Dad's shotgun in our home and came from a long line of people for whom hunting was a way to feed the family.  Our complete inability to enact sane gun laws is not about hunting nor the 2nd Amendment - it's about money.  Gun manufacturers + the NRA + money + Congress = Columbine, Sandy Hook, Orlando, Charlottesville, Las Vegas, countless others, and now this.  I spent 39 years as a public school teacher, and we always had fire drills and an occasional, usually fake, bomb threat.  What we have now is a nation that is held hostage by the gun industry and their enablers, a nation where it isn't safe to send your kids to school.  Spare us \"thoughts and prayers\" - empty platitudes. , 6 I loathe the second amendment. It's outdated and has no relevance in the times in which we live.\n\nThere will always be gun enthusiasts. In the spirit of compromise, I am o.k. with vetted citizens possessing guns as long as there are limits to how many, stringent yearly permits, and extensive yearly background checks. Gun owners should bear the costs themselves of this oversight. \n\nCertain countries have monopolies on selling particular goods (Canada and Sweden have government-run stores which sell all alcoholic beverages). Perhaps guns should be sold only through bonded, government-approved businesses who would be held liable if they didn't strictly enforce the rules. Those same businesses could broker sales between private individuals and issue and renew permits as well. The fees generated from the permits and fees should be high enough to cover the required costs to regulate much more stringently the sale of all firearms.\n\nPenalties for persons (gun owners or owners of gun businesses) violating any gun laws should be mandatory prison time.\n\nBetween the deranged NRA/millions of Americans' obsession with guns and the illegal immigration situation holding our country hostage, I am seriously considering moving abroad. Why are our laws not enforced? Without the rule of law, the rights and quality of life of U.S. citizens are eroding day by day. Strange, sad times we live in., 6 Sadly, tomorrow this will be yesterdays news to those of us\nwho are not directly hurt.  Our elected officials have security\nand body guards.  Why?  And why do they continue to let this\nhappen?, 6 Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and the rest of the Republican surge have no business lecturing the Public on the morality of the nightmare that they are enabling in this country.    , 6 As I have asked my parents, do YOU who support public ownership of military weapons feel any twinge of guilt that you have been successful in re-introducing the legal sale of these weapons into our society after then had been made illegal to purchase?  Does former president George W Bush feel these killings more deeply than the rest off us, having allowed these weapons back into our gun shops for (nearly) all to buy? These guns are selected by killers to kill mass numbers of humans because these guns were specifically designed for that purpose and are good at it.  Lets go back to hunting and self defense weapons only please., 6 We MUST control gun sales, beginning with automatic weapons and this young man's gun. Why are legislators so susceptible to the NRA, when their own children may be the next victims? And we also need to increase funding for mental health care. The shooter, at 19, has destroyed his own life, along with the precious lives of 17 others., 6 No amount of blaming will ease the pain and sorrow of those who lost their loved ones. To those whose lives were cut short we should all offer our apologies not just condolences. We as a nation have failed them. We must do better than this. We can find a solution and must do so soon. I don't have that solution, but it's out there somewhere. Maybe gun control is part of it, maybe changing the way ammo is sold or how it is packaged, or maybe we have place police guards in every school, but I don't think it will ever stop until we understand why violence happens and what drives it. It could be social justice and conditioning people to treat each other fairly. It may be as simple as a change in the foods we eat. , 6 I choose to live in central Mexico 1/2 the year, where I feel MUCH safer doing normal things citizens should be able to do in a 'civilized country'.  Mass shootings in schools, churches, concerts, clubs, movie theaters or malls just do not happen here (violence associated with the drug trade to feed the U.S. appetite, is isolated and targeted).  There seems to be MUCH less mental illness, more family connections with less disenfranchised people, and certainly less guns in the hands of average citizens.  The U.S. is one scary place these days with NO ONE to protect us., 6 I am sorry- but no where is the malignancy of the Republican party so evident than in their stand on gun control. They would sacrifice children's lives for political hush money and pride. I hold this party accountable for these deaths and others.\n\nThis is not so much injecting politics into tragedy- but a firm recognition of the tragedy that politics in the lowest sense of the word engenders- making us all victims. , 6 I guess I'm a terrible person, but when I hear of these school shootings in red states, I think \"You thought having all these guns was a great idea, so this is what you get\"., 6 These school shootings and other gun massacres are something distinctly American, in some of the most dangerous areas in the world...middle east, Pakistan, Afghanistan i have never heard of a school shooting, done by an ordinary citizen...terrorist with a political agenda of course happens all the time.\n\nWhy is it that countries that are awash with more military hardware than you can imagine, don't have individual citizens without a political agenda who commit mass murder...but in the US it happens weekly., 6 Well...nothing new, typical USA. Isn't even  worth to write an article about it, its a common occurrence., 6 I, for one, am not able to shrug off these incidents. Every day we send our children to schools, do we have to think about this potentially happening?\n\nEnough.\n\nHunters with basic rifles - ok. A basic weapon combined with training to defend your home - perhaps. AR-15s and similar weapons available for legal purchase? No, no, no., 6 I used to look at places like Pakistan and Afghanistan, feeling sorry for the people in those places because of all the suicide bombings, thinking those places were somehow flawed - and smugly thinking that we are not flawed like that. But wait a second - it now seems that we - us - have more gun attacks than those countries have bombings. So now it seems that we too are flawed and that we have a very deep problem that must be addressed.  , 6 We don't have to live this way. Call your Congressperson right now. \n\nGet on the mailing list for Everytown for Gun Safety. Only when pro-sanity organizations are larger than the NRA, will our craven politicians finally start to listen. , 6 This 2nd amendment stuff is a nonsense. Everyone knows that., 6 May God be with these people as they work through this terrible, but real tragedy. No one should ever have to go through this, but unfortunately they do. The least we can do is pray for and support these people., 6 Gun control and crime control require controls put on males. And that will not happen in the U.S. that adores its violent sons. The U.S. has always defined masculinity as aggressive and predatory. That's why this nation attracts that retrograde degenerate element, both native and immigrant - has for 240 years. We grow violent males like a fungus on the forest floor - and make endless excuses for them. It isn't 19-year-old girls stalking classmates and shooting up schools every month. It isn't 64-year-old women camping out with their arsenal in a Vegas hotel suite and slaughtering people below at a music concert. It isn't entitled and pampered rich Connecticut young girls plotting to shoot up 1st graders in their tiny town. , 6 It is time to name the NRA, and the elected officials who take money from them, as Unindicted Co-Conspirators.  If now is not the time to talk about Gun Control, then maybe we have to haul them all into court so they can explain themselves to the mothers and fathers grieving in the front row.   , 6 Yesterday 17 more lives were taken by a gun man coming into a school in Parkland Florida. Students and Teachers, innocent souls lost. Many injured, some might still die from there wounds. It was Valentines Day, a day now tarnished forever for many. Our lawmakers seem to care about only changing laws when it comes to unborn children, when will they start caring about those outside the womb., 6 I want to thank the Supreme Court for all it has done through the decades to take a law that had about as much relevance as the Constitutional Amendment that demanded that private citizens feed and house THE MILITIA within their own homes, you know, that Second Amendment that says that a \"MILITIA\" may use \"arms\" (muskets and swords). \n\n(And a  special shout-out to Scalia ((yes, I know he's dead)) for energizing the brain-dead that swear that there is no difference between a \"MILITIA\" and an \"individual\". What an amazing legacy that is, that will stand for centuries: \"The Scalia Scam\"!)\n\nWithout Scalia and the likes of that sexual harasser, Clarence Thomas, and the other righties on that Court, then this could have been a pretty good country.\nBut it is not.\nIt's a nation that wants to stick a couple of cans of diced beets in a box to shut up the hungry - as if we don't remember Ronnie Reagan swearing that \"Ketchup is a vegetable\"!!!! - and just wants us to shut up on THAT GUN THING!\n\nThat's not going to happen.\nI'm sick of my country being the ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD where private citizens get to have ALL THE GUNS THEY WANT with ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY.\nName me one other factor in our lives where there is utter immunity - just one.\nNot in sex.\nNot in education.\nNot on our cars.\nOr homes, or marriages or parenthood or drinking or even eating a burger in a fast food joint.\nWe even have to follow the laws on our bikes.\n\nWhat a scam!\nYank every one of them!\nNO REPUBLICANS EVER AGAIN!, 6 Media media PLEASE stop reporting on school shootings. Nobody cares as evidenced that no matter how horrific, our lawmakers do nothing. \n\nFlorida HAS liberal gunlaws. Obviously the kids knew this would happened, but what adult cared enough to intervene? \n\nMeanwhile, we will spend $25 BILLION on border security, ban muslems from 9 countries from entering the US, and do NOTHING to prevent mass murders committed by our own citizens.\n\nNational Rifle Attrocity you win again! , 6 \"We have met the enemy and it is us\"., 6 It is a mystery to me that the US American electorate tolerates anything like this. The arms industries deliver brown envelopes to congressmen and the crazy hullabaloo goes on and on year after another. How come it isn't criminal in the United States of America that congressmen can be bought to the pockets of the big business? Perhaps examination of accounts should be in order time to time. Dozens of young people lose their lives just because madmen have weaponry to mass murder. It isn't right. Why do you tolerate this?, 6 This has to stop.  This has to stop.  This has to stop., 6 This is another horror.  You send your child off to school to get an education not to be killed or terrorized by a madman.\n\nWhenever these massacres happen, the NRA goes into stealth mode. One of their biggest supporters is the Governor of Florida Rick Scott who has a A+ rating from the NRA. On June 20, 2014, Scott signed 5 pro-gun law bill into law. The NRA know how to reward their people.\n\nUntil the majority of Americans change their minds about the insanity of having open-carry gun laws and lax rules about purchasing armamenst fit for a  full scale war, the massacres will go on and on., 6 45 \u201coffered his prayers\u201d? Who wrote that for him to say?, 6 Sad. This continues, and yet no decent gun laws. Then the hypocrisy. When the guy was not killed, it was easy to figure he was white, and usual, he has a mental problem. Yet some other race would have been condemned as a terrorist. , 6 Am I supposed to feel sorry? Is this an opportunity for me to dig into my bottomless trough of thoughts and prayers?  I don't think so.  This type of killing has the blessing of a democratically elected Congress.  These recent killings will not even make a blip in the average annual USA gun deaths.  Our alleged leadership consider themselves hamstrung?  Meanwhile black men and boys continue to be killed with impunity by authorities sworn to serve.  This accused killer sounds like he is sick and unsworn.  The chickens are coming home. I hope they stay., 6 Another shooting, warning signs from this kid were ignored, it was a gun-free zone where someone with a concealed carry license could possibly have made a difference.  Meanwhile students receive mind altering medication (drugs) to alter behavior patterns that were once called normal.  The solution as usual is to blame the NRA.  Pathetic., 6 Hey Congress! You can't outlaw anger. You can't outlaw mental illness.\n\nYou can do something about these weapons!\n\nDo something to stop this madness., 6 \u201cNeighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\u201d Trump\u2019s latest tweet. Sooooo....The President is saying guns don\u2019t kill kids, it\u2019s the kids and their teachers who fail to report a fellow student\u2019s mentally ill behavior to the cops who kill students?, 6 Gun or no gun. People live people die. It's called life. Get over it., 6 When an immigrant commits a crime Trump bleats about all immigrants, but when a shooter (Las Vegas, Texas, you name it) mows down innocent people like this there is no corresponding bleat about gun ownership and responsibility. You figure it out., 6 The CDC was forbidden to study gun violence, courtesy of your Republican representative.\nLock them up., 6 Interesting that the Word-A-Day for today is \u201cMolochize\u201d.  It\u2019s a verb, meaning to sacrifice, after the god Moloch.  He was the Canaanite god who required the sacrifice of children.  How many more children will we sacrifice to the gods of the NRA and their purported defense of the Second Amendment?, 6 This recurrent, obscene slaughter of  kids (!)  in schools (!) does not happen in any other nation on the planet\nWhat \"well regulated militia\" are these men and boy american shooters part of ? , 6 Here is the cure for this insanity:  Require gun buyers to first obtain a hunting license, and gun owners to obtain one in order to make their guns legal.  Make all non-hunting guns illegal.  Make the hunting license detailed, and the penalty for not having one strict and expensive., 6 Yesterday early evening - Valentine's Day... Ash Wednesday, just another day of the week, we learned of the horror that was continuing to unfold in Florida. My two children -cried for those suffering... people who they do not know, but yet we all know.\n\"How can someone hurt their school friends and teachers? How did the grown ups not protect them?\" \"Are we safe when we go to school?\" \"There are so many shootings, why doesn't our President outlaw guns so that kids are protected?\u201d This was the conversation that I had with my babies as I put them to bed last night. My heart - and the hearts of millions of Americans - is breaking wide open and I lay awake most of the night wondering how to protect my little ones wondering how each of us can help to FINALLY make a real change.\nIt is appalling how many in our government take MILLIONS from the NRA in financing - until this changes, our society will continue to be controlled by special interests. The \"right to bear arms\" is NOT the right to purchase automatic weapons and magazines to unleash your grievances on hundreds of innocent people. It is up to US as Americans to ensure that those who take money from ANY organizations who tolerate violence, hatred, and intolerance are NOT elected.\nDo your homework and - when you go to the poles - don't vote for ANYONE taking donations from the NRA. It's time to take our country back - we are better than this. Our children deserve better than this., 6 First of all, we must note that the Republican Party is owned, body and soul, by the National Rifle Association.  The Republicans are bought and paid for -- and paid handsomely.  That said, there is presently another reason why deplorables such as Sean Hannity will insist upon spinning the story as a \"mental illness problem\" rather than a \"gun problem\" every time there is a mass shooting in a school, a church, a nightclub, a shopping mall, or any other place where people congregate.  That \"other reason,\" aside from the cash flow, is the simple fact that mass shootings immediately upend the News Cycle and thus give Trump and his White House an opportunity to go about their conspiratorial activities with less attention on the part of the media.  I truly believe that Trump and his contemptible crew welcome these atrocities as a smoke-screen., 6 Another success story for the public school system., 6 My heartfelt condolences to the parents and families of the 17 souls as well as the injured students.\n\nI know that everything is being turned over to find the motive for this insane murder spree. The mass shooter in Las Vegas had his brain analyzed to find a reason for his crimes. Lives and family members and associates of these murderers are turned upside down and scapegoats are made.\nWe are kidding ourselves thinking that finding the reason for one murder will prevent that of another. All we find is there are as many reasons for killings as there are murders.\n\nWe need to stop the means with which these tragedies are taking place and it is summed up in a four letter word: GUNS.\n\nFailure to stop the NRA who's only reason for twisting the Second Amendment to their, the gun lobbies and gun manufactures advantage. Had the founding fathers of America known what is going on we all know they would be turning over in their graves., 6 \"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" Whose rights were violated? \n\nWhy weren't all the victims armed ? How many people were killed or wounded yesterday? Today? Tomorrow? The death toll rises.\n\nReporters will fill in the blanks in their pre-written news stories...time, day, location, number killed, number wounded, hospital name, gunman's name, personal details. age, family, how many and what kind of semi-automatic weapons were used, whether he obtained them legally, were there any signs that he could do this before he acted. Then interviews with survivors and their families, local police chiefs, first responders, and neighbors.\n\nThen the standard \"our thoughts and prayers go out to the families,\" \"this is not the time to talk about guns,\" \"let's not make politics out of this tragedy,\" \"background checks...,\" \"keep guns out of the hands of...,\" \"right to bear arms...,\" \"mental illness...,\"\n\nGuns now kill more Americans- men, women, and children than auto accidents.\n\nAutomobiles must meet safety standards (regulations). Seat belts must be used (regulations). Drivers must be licensed (regulations). Drivers must be distracted or impaired (regulations). Traffic laws and signs must be obeyed (regulations). Automobiles must be insured (regulations). Automobile makers can be sued for safety violations.\n\nMeanwhile the NRA and Republicans say deaths, injury, disabilities, and loss of loved ones are the price we must pay for our \"freedom.\"\n\nThis story is coming to your town., 6 Assault rifles shouldn't exist outside of war, but is it about guns? Wouldn't tossing a grenade in a classroom or mowing down students in the parking lot after school in a vehicle look the same? Heaven forbid bombs or chemical weapons render scenes like this small ball one day. , 6 \"The price of freedom\" is not worth the life of one child., 6 I think maybe it's time that Law Enforcement in this country stop allowing themselves to be props behind supposed law enforcement candidates like Donald Trump who is in the pockets of the Gun Lobby and the NRA.\n\nI think it's time Law Enforcement and their unions who seem to stupidly line up behind right wing conservatives, who do nothing but pay lip service to supporting law enforcement.....it's time the Law Enforcement push in unison for Federal Bans on all military style weapons, and any weapon that is used just for killing in quantities, this would exclude hunting and target shooting weapons. , 6 What else needs to happen for any serious change to take place? Reflect for a moment...what else even *could* happen that hasn't already? This is not the \"NRA\" problem, nor is it just another \"Lone Wolf.\" This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. According to a study done by the NYT (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-inte..., since 1966, over 90 mass shooters have attacked innocent Americans. The rest of the world? No more than 18. Like most of us, I don't have any good answers. But we must ask ourselves why we seem to be the only place in the world where children, teenagers, or college students like me, can say goodbye to their parents on their way to school and never return home. , 6 The responsibility lies directly with Republican Congressmen that take money from the NRA and gun manufactures to allow anybody, of any mental capacity, felon or not, to be able to purchase a weapon through the gun show loophole; and refuse to label the assault weapon a weapon of war. You cannot purchase hand grenades, nor rocket launchers, why are civilians allowed to purchase semiautomatic weapons and large magazines? They have one purpose only, killing lots of people in a short time.\n\nPeople have no reason to own assault weapons; or magazines that hold more than 6-shots; or fires Cop Killer bullets; or have silencers or have semi-automatic fire. Bolt action, lever action or pump is enough. , 6 I don't support the second amendment. I don\u2019t believe in it and I think it should be scrapped. No apologies, no regrets.. repeal it. It is poorly written and the current interpretation is obscenely detached from its reasonable intent. It has no more to do with our time and culture than powdered wigs and lead tableware. To \"bear arms\" and to wield the weapons of today are as far apart as riding a horse and piloting an F-16. The ability to defend oneself in close quarters and the power to effortlessly decimate multiple lives at a distance in a matter of seconds are not equal.\nAnd despite the pandering revisionist opinion of some conservatives and activist judges... the second amendment was about arming militias. There is no doubt to anyone who understands history and the intent of this amendment.\nWhen it passed in 1789, Rifles did not yet exist. The bullet would not exist for another 65 years. The weapon of the day was a musket which weighed about 10lbs, fired one shot and had en effective range of 50 yards.\nToday, a typical handgun can weigh less than a pound, hold 20 rounds and is effective at 150 yards. It can be repeatedly fired by a child and can be reloaded in seconds.\nThe AR-15 can fire 800 rounds in a minute, has a effective range of over 2000 yards and a muzzle velocity of 3200 fps. It weighs about 7 pounds and is available by 16 different manufacturers at a cost less than the average American's 1 week salary., 6 Another needless, senseless, heartbreaking massacre that is totally owned by the republicans.\nThis isn't America's problem this is a Republican problem.   We've got to vote them out of office., 6 We have the culture we deserve., 6 Well.... yet another person left behind. His mother dies in November leaving him with no one so the counseling he was getting stopped. He also had no where to live.  Kicked out of school where everyone seemed to know he has problems and still gets to buy a gun........\n3000+ students saw the school, and society NOT take care of someone who was so troubled what did they learn to caring on to their family.\nSO SAD......, 6 One cannot ignore that such incidents affect the country's sanity at large. Heavily-armed lunatics are holding the country hostage., 6 Who cares WHY?  This shooting - like the other 17 school shootings in the last 46 days according to NBC - is because of GUNS.  \n\nI was sickened to see the corrupt governor of Florida - Ric Scott - say this was an act of pure evil.  HE and his Robber Baron brethren who passed \"stand your ground\" laws in Florida in homage to the NRA are the evil ones.  They are the ones trying to destroy OUR United States of America through fear-hate-anger-death-destruction.  If guns don't do it they will kill us with our hard-earned Corporate-Welfare-taxpayer-funded health care death system.\n\nGET GUNS OFF THE STREETS OF OUR AMERICA.\n\nEVERY gun must be REGISTERED on a national database, state LICENSED and Fully Insured for LIABILITY.\n\nWE THE PEOPLE must DEMAND it.  WE must elect Socially Conscious Women and Men who will make it so.  NOW is the time., 6 I'm a 72 year old average American woman and mother. First, my heart breaks for all of those who lived and died through this experience.\nSecond. Australia experienced a mass shooting in 1996. Took action. No more mass shootings. This is not rocket science. There is such a thing as \"benchmarking\".\nI'm not interested in hearing why the Australian solution would NOT work in the US.\nI AM interested in seeing NO MORE shootings - none as in \"0\".\n3 Propositions:\n1.I propose someone in the HOUSE and SENATE put to an immediate vote that we adopt the same methods as used in Australia - to a House and Senate vote.\n2. I propose that we list the results of the vote by state and elected official.\n3. I propose that all papers publish the results of this vote.\nThat's it - straight and simple.\nWe, the people, keep saying rightly, how our hearts are broken, our thoughts and prayers are with, etc, etc, etc. Have we the will to take actions to push\nour elected officials to do the right thing?, 6 There is simply no reason for a civilian to own an AR-15. Period., 6 The NRA and it's cowardly members and political supporters are to blame for this and all other mass shootings.  These types of weapons do not belong in the hands of civilians., 6 Here's what President Trump had to say, \"So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!\"\n\nEverybody knew, yet political cowardice, greed and obtuseness tolerated ownership of an AR-15 by a teenager known to be mentally deranged. And our bone spur afflicted president supports Congress to enact interstate gun reciprocity so that this could happen as easily in Connecticut and Massachusetts as in the Gunshine State, Florida. \n\nDRAG AMERICA DOWN AGAIN!, 6 The Congress and the President have a real opportunity here to break the  ideological logjam that is threatening our democracy and putting our children's lives at risk.  Democrats... give Mr. Trump all the money he wants for his wall and border security, Mr. Trump and his Administration...provide vocal and active support of the reinstatement of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban., 6 There is a way to stop this nightmare.  Stop voting for any politician who accepts money from the NRA. They bear their share of the blame for these killings. , 6 There are tracking devices for orders of protection and parolees and there should be for any assault rifle owner. It is not enough to rely on a lock box in a home. It should also be triggered when an assault rifle is any car or school building. Apparently a smoke alarm is no match for an assault weapon in the building. Technology exists and airports have it , on star, etc. Technology needs to advance on the movement of this sort of assault weapon. Police were outmatched  here in the 6 minutes it takes to do a massacre and the police chief Israel in Brovard county admitted it., 6 Based on news reports, plenty of his social media clues. Google,as the YouTube owner, Facebook, Twitter, etc they all need to he held accountable for what they are hosting on their servers via their services. I am helping a friend with what seems to be a case of catfishing and fraud in Second Life, and the stuff we are seeing is sick and horrifying. What these people hiding behind these cartoons, avatars, are engaged in  are clear signs of mentally unstable and sick people who very likely sooner or later will cross the line from \"fantasy\" or \"role playing\" to real life. , 6 Thoughts & prayers haven\u2019t worked so far. Maybe it is time to actually address the gun problem with some real solution that doesn\u2019t involve the supernatural.   , 6 We are living in The Walking Dead. Zombies roam among us. They love guns more than human life. They most frequently shoot themselves, their partners, their friends, their children. It was just a \"domestic dispute.\" 90+ a day. Some days, someone takes a weapon designed to shoot humans in battlefield conditions and lives out their sexual fantasy of killing. Sometimes they shoot 8, 10, 12, 17, 50 dead before they are done. It can be at a church, a school, a concert, the mall, a movie theater, a church.\nAnd we do nothing.\nUntil we stand up, forcefully, to this madness, it will only get worse. , 6 Dear Mr. Sessions:\n\nPlace one of your 'Anglo-American' brothers in each school in America. \n\nI'm quite sure their time would be better served protecting our innocent children rather than killing my innocent brothers during 'routine' traffic stops.\n\nChris, 6 We need to allow unfettered carriage of guns in the Capital, the White House, and the halls of Congress. Concealed or open-carry - either will do. I\u2019m concerned about our representatives\u2019 safety otherwise. , 6 So far, there are close to 2,500 comments, and twice that in recommendations. We mostly agree with each other and share the outrage and frustration, shock, shame for our country, and numbing sadness. What we can do, however, is join the Everytown Campaign, and then pick up the phone, and call the Republican senators who accept money from the NRA. We can donate to Sen. Chris Murphy, who has been fighting ferociously for common sense gun laws since Sandy Hook. He is the NRA's lead opponent in the Senate. Actually, we can do all those things. And if each of the 4,000 k likes and commenters did them, they would have an impact. These don't have to be huge donations or huge commitments of time. 10 minutes and 25 dollars will speak volumes. The NRA is not passive. Why should we be?, 6 Let's compare where mass shootings in the US occur.  Which states? Then compare the state gun laws.  Straight up - let's look at the impact of stricter gun laws on the incidence of gun laws on mass shootings.  No more discussion about mental health - the issue is access to weapons designed for mass killing.  On the issue of mental health, many people with all types of mental problems live safely in our society - mental health is not the primary issue.  Further, the current plans to reduce food stamps to food boxes, make Medicaid recipients work, having ICE agents tear families apart, disrupting the accessibility to health insurance  - all only adds to societal pressures.  A president whose campaign speeches urged violence.  But we don't touch gun laws.  We are so far down the road of destabilizing our own country, it makes me sick.  This is all about the AWOL GOP Congress., 6 Trump claimed full credit for the (trivial) improvement in airline safety in 2017; will he also accept full responsibility for the lack of progress in preventing school shootings?, 6 The cell phone videos show everything that you should NOT do in an active shooter situation. Shelter in place means you are a perfect target. Call your local police department and ask for an in-school training showing the Run, Hide, Fight video. The appropriate and safest thing to do in an active shooter situation is to RUN. It's extremely difficult to shoot a moving target. \n\nIf running is not possible, HIDE. Turn your cell phone to SILENT. Be quiet. \n\nAs a last resort, and someone will get killed doing this, is to fight. Be prepared to kill the shooter. \n\nYour local police department can give you more information and can provide an officer to go to schools and train the students about what to do in an active shooter situation. , 6 I'm sure it's \"too soon\" to talk about guns - it always is, especially given the millions the NRA spends to buy legislators. But how about talking about taxes? We can't do anything about the millions of assault weapons already out there, so what about a 100% tax (or tariff) on the manufacture and/or (legal) sale of every AR-15 or similar semi-automatic weapon and the magazine clips that feed them? If it stops being profitable for manufacturers and gun shop owners, won't that be a reasonable first step in slowing down the process of obtaining one? The government used the Treasury department to get Al Capone; maybe it's time to remove the issue from the hands of lap dog legislators and go after a greater menace. Of course, we could instead offer our \"thoughts and prayers\". That works as well as anything Congress is doing. , 6 Has anyone asked Marco Rubio and Governor Rick Scott, why they continue to worry about their ratings and support from the NRA, and the Gun Lobby, but ignore these bloody mass shootings, they have as much blood on their hands as the gun lobby and the killers.\n\nI don't want to hear about mental health.   \n\nWe know anyone who kills like that has a mental health problem, but I'm starting to think anyone who wants to own a plethora of weapons, AR-15's, Military style killing machines has a mental health problem too., 6 OK, Florida voters, it's up to you, now. This is one of the best high schools in your state. It's time for YOU to make a stand against assault rifles. Ask every politician running for a local, state or federal office where they stand on banning assault rifles, and make it clear THAT one issue will determine your vote.\n\n'Second Amendment' voters will vote against anyone supporting a ban, and the rest of you will vote for those supporting a ban. Let the NRA see where you stand.\n\nCall it a Right to Life vote for those already born., 6 FIRST: Ban all assault and semi-automatic weapons.  Period.  SECOND: No purchasing of weapons that kill on-line or through the mail. THIRD: Background checks cross-referenced with mental health records, criminal records and terrorist watch lists, FOURTH, no concealed weapons; restrictions on hand guns like New York City\u2019s. FIFTH- as we do with cars, marriages and dogs, training, tests, licensing and registration. SIXTH- all guns must be INSURED by owners. SEVENTH-waiting periods, like those we have for abortions. EIGHTH- Gun locks, make it a crime to keep a gun unlocked when minors or mentally ill people are present. NINTH- Smart guns which only fire for the owner.  This technology exists, why is it not required? TENTH\u2014all bullets need to be ID\u2019d, ELEVENTH\u2014US government will only purchase guns from manufacturers who use all current safety regulations, devices and precautions. , 6 What stood out to me most yesterday were the interviews with the students.  The majority were so calm and articulate, describing carnage I can only dream about in my worst nightmares.  When did this begin to happen, that our babies have become so desensitized to horrific events such as this? My thoughts and prayers go out to the loved ones of these victims and my heart aches for those who witnessed this tragic event.  My only hope for the students who are left to cope with the aftermath, is that they get counseling and recognize that they need time to process what they witnessed and are able to grieve their losses., 6 I didn't read the article. Didn't have to. The story is thecsame as always; only the names and locations change. We have a political party beholden to gun makers and gun advocacy groups. Beholden to the extent they unapologetically suppress any data related to the carnage caused by guns. They deliberately shape the narrative around gun violence to blame \"the bad guy with a gun\" or the phantom nightmare of a mentally ill person who (not our fault) who somehow? got a gun. The reality is that most gun deaths are committed by someone they know (family member) and for which there is no protection. Usually, sacrifices lambs are slaughtered for the greater good. In the case of school shootings, the sacrificial lambs are just slaughtered. Very sad. , 6 Teachers and school staff need to stage a national strike to change our gun laws.  Shut down our schools.  It will be hard on families, but in the long run, we're saving lives and America. , 6 Why people continue to say \"thoughts and prayers\" secondary to school shootings is an anathema to humanity.  School yards will soon resemble the TSA airport screening and with Trump-style Mexican Walls built around the premises.  Private enterprise will own the school facilities and America marches on.  The NRA and GOP are two peas in a pod.  Statistically speaking, how many distraught, disturbed male teenagers are there in America: millions.  How easy is it for a nutcase teenager to grab a weapon of war from Walmart's or from his neighbor's cabinet.  Easy as pie.   I say invest in body armor for teenagers as more are lost than our war fighting service members in the Army, Navy and Marines.  You're less likely to die as a Marine than being a high school student in America.  , 6 As everyone has pointed out America is the only nation that has this problem. Europe has a long and treasured hunting culture, Japan is the mecca of video games. \n\nAmerica has all of that, but the big difference is the hilariously easy access to military style weapons, and the evaporated moral center. America has been brainwashed into trading life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the pursuit of the dollar. We have evangelicals stand side by side with merchants of death shoveling thoughts and prayers, wads of cash into politician's pockets. \n\nRepublicans put the value of your life at 64 cents. That's how much the NRA pays them per America life. , 6 In the movie \"Reds\" Warren Beatty (Jack Reed) is asked what is the reason for WWI in which he answers \"Profits\"., 6 Once again, blood falls on the souls of the NRA, its  gun lobby, and  its  greedy minions. Also, on the souls of those weak little people in Congress who haven't the guts to deal with this issue., 6 Not\nReally\nAmericans\n\nNow\nRussian\nAssets\n\nNo\nRational\nActions\n\nNeeds\nRemedial\nAttention\n\nNow\nRequires\nAudit, 6 Three words: Campaign. Finance. Reform... because Thoughts and Prayers clearly arent working., 6 This gun crazy country, and I do mean crazy, will continue to wake to mass shootings every month until we do something to control access to these weapons of mass destruction.  This isn't going to magically stop.\n\nThe Republicans who obstruct sensible gun control are a wholly owned subsidiary of the NRA, literally paid to stand by and accept the mass murder of children.  The rest of those who accept this insanity have lost touch with reality., 6 To paraphrase a song by Roy Orbison about soldiers in wartime:\n\"Listen all you people\nTry and understand\nYou may be a student\nWoman , child, or man\nBut there won't be many coming home\nNo there won't be many coming home.......\"\n\nWho are we as a people to let a spineless, self serving legislative body deny us common sense gun laws as they follow the dictates of the gun manufacturers  and their wholly owned subsidiary the NRA. When will the tipping point be reached? What is the number of students , church goers, music lovers that have to die before we take a stand from which we will not retreat. I thought that would be Sandy Hook, now I have no idea what it would take. But regardless of the \"now is not the time to talk about it \" sycophants. it most certainly is. KA   , 6 Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers \n\nHas it worked yet? NO?! \n\nOK. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers. , 6 My new grandson is 15 months old today.  I want my daughter to start looking for another country to emigrate to where she can send him off to school safely.   Where he can play among people who care about their children and the weak and the elderly.   I'm sick to the bottom of my soul that mass shootings are becoming a daily occurrence. \n\nThey take our away our health care and erode our Medicare system to kill us off; they defund our public education to turn us into a country of complacent lemmings; they encourage the purchase of weapons so we kill each other off when all else fails.  This is not a country I want my grandson growing up in.  \n\nImmigration?  Don't worry about it.  The new American policy of violence proliferation will ensure no one will want to come here anyway., 6 To Trump and Congress:\n\nYes, and how many times can a man turn his head\nAnd pretend that he just doesn\u2019t see?\n\nThe answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind\nThe answer is blowing in the wind\n\nYes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows\nThat too many people have died?\n\nThe answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind\nThe answer is blowing in the wind, 6 This is likely to continue until a gang armed with guns like that attack Congress and shoot a few hundred senators and representatives., 6 Nothing will change.  The next mass school shooting will inevitably happen, it is a mere matter of time.  It will perhaps be less spectacular and go underreported, but it will be as deadly as every shooting has been.  Should we treat The Gun as a matter of public health, as nicholas Kristof urges in his column today?  I certainly think this nation suffers from a massive collective mental health crisis, and the clinical capacity to deal with it is woefully inadequate.  Which is why the illness expresses itself by means of gun violence, sexual violence, opioid addiction, and in ways too many to count. There is no end in sight, as the nation is bereft of leadership that deserves that qualification (in both political parties).  America is a danger to self and others: reason to be admitted to a psychiatric facility. The US is now the most dangerous among wealthy nations for a child to be born.  So much for the \"pro-life\" fundamentalists who claim to uphold Christian values.  In fact, they are the followers of the cult of AmeriChristianity, holding the cross wrapped in the flag in one hand, and The Gun in the other, and bringing death and destruction not only onto America's streets, but into America's schools and homes, and, yes, into America's very own soul. Woe to any child being born on its soil., 6 Be brave, senators and representatives in office. Yesterday and many other yesterdays were the missed opportunities to change gun laws. Be brave\u2014 we need your courage right now as our children and our citizens are being slaughtered by your partisanship, inaction, greediness, inertia. DO SOMETHING! , 6 We don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s too soon to talk about gun control today. We don\u2019t want to hear fake outrage that how dare anyone politicize this tragedy.\n\nPoliticize it, keep this front and center, the vast majority of Americans support reform of gun laws and are fed up with the lack of courage in Congress., 6 All politicians who received money from NRA are culpable. The responsibility is squarely on them for not doing anything.  , 6 Congress takes millions and millions from the NRA.  Money is more important than their own citizens they are elected to protect.  We need to stop worshipping  dollars. , 6 Yet we have people like Rubio, Trump, supporting automatic weapons so they can continue to receive MONEY. More dead students in the USA in eighteen months than in eighteen years in the rest of the world., 6 Why the need to own an assault riffle? Though the NRA and some gun rights advocates argue they need these weapons to protect themselves, in truth they want these military-style guns because harbor the bizarre notion that someday they may need to be prepared and equipped to take on the government. At the federal and state local, many legislators have are essentially owned by the NRA. There minds cannot and will not be changed. The only way to move forward with reasonable gun restrictions is to defeat these NRA-sponsored politicians at the polls this coming November. While there are some red-state Democrats in the pocket of the NRA, the great majority of them are Republicans. If you care about our nation's children, if you care about delivering American society from the clutches of the gun manufacturer's lobby, then get out and vote. Inaction amounts to complicity in needless, mindless slaughter. , 6 You have an editorial entitled \"American disdain for childrens' lives\".  That's wrong. It's politicians' disdain for childrens' lives. The most recent polling says a majority of Americans back stricter gun control laws. The blood money people like Rubio & Cruz have taken from the NRA means they're not doing as their constituents wish. Again., 6 Republican politicians need to adopt a more convenient shorthand to respond to these tragedies, since their response is always the same, and the events are happening with such frequency, as Republicans choose to do nothing about it. So perhaps they could just tweet \"OTAP\"( our thoughts and prayers), and go on about their day, lunching with the NRA, etc.  , 6 we all know congress will do nothing on gun control. I think we should push them to repeal the law that blocks the cdc from gun violence research. at a minimum it would be interesting to see what reasons are made up to try to block it., 6 Again and again as our leaders sit and do nothing while protected by security from the people they serve. Today we all cry in paralyzed horror. Tomorrow, work to unseat our mercenary leaders as if your children's lives depended on it. , 6 Much love to encircle those in such horrible pain.\nGun owners, Second Amendment folks, cannot have their cake and eat it too. As long as there are semi-automatic weapons available anywhere, these horrible kind of events will continue. This is not what our founders envisioned when they wrote that amendment.\nAnd as long as hate continues to be the theme of our culture, people will use hate to strike at the undefended.\nAbolish semi automatic weapons! Not one person needs them for sport. Not one true sportsperson should look at any semiautomatic weapon they own with pride. We are all to blame for this lack of attention to this problem. , 6 Do not blame the NRA.\n\nDo not blame our politicians.\n\nDo not blame video games or Hollywood or mental health professionals.\n\nLook at the woman or the man in the mirror.\n\nWe the People of the United States keep electing people to Congress who will not outlaw military style weapons, who will not strengthen background checks, who will not limit the size of magazines. After Las Vegas, our lawmakers OUR lawmakers have not banned the device that turns a semi automatic weapon into an automatic weapon.\n\nI heard someone on a comedy show say that the United States has more mass shootings than rainy days. This is pathetic and true.\n\nSo unless We the People are ready to vote differently, then let us not talk about sending anyone our thoughts and prayers., 6 Did school have a metal  detector? Was security looking at the camera  upon his entry and ready to take action with drawn guns, no code or warning or directions on loud speaker system. AK47 and AR115 need an on star system or better to be traced by police and the military in his car. As soon as he left his home with the rifle in the car should have triggered some tracking just the way license plates and tolls are gathered. , 6 Four school shootings and we are merely in mid February.  Seventeen people died at the scene and more may die in the coming days due to their severe injuries from the shooting.  Democrats will call for the passage of gun laws and Republicans, exemplified by the likes of Senator Rubio, will come out on Fox to say this is not the time to talk about new laws.  No matter how frequent, how deadly, how horrific the carnage for some politicians it is never the right time to talk about guns or do something about them.  We will now be regaled to interviews from \u201ccommon folks\u201d who will argue the remedy is yet more guns and statements from the NRA that guns do not kill but people do and that by golly the 2nd Amendment is sacred and nothing, absolutely nothing can be enacted to put any restrictions on our God-given right to arm ourselves to the teeth no matter how reasonable and supported by the MAJORITY of American. And another shiny object will distract our attention and nothing will be done.  And just as the sun comes up in the east we soon will have another mass shooting and the same cycle will repeat.  That is our reality and it will not change until we finally tell our politicians that either they do our bidding or the NRA\u2019s and if they do not listen we kick them out of office the next election cycle., 6 It's the gun lobby, period. People are overwhelmingly in favor of background checks, bans on assault rifles, and not allowing guns in the hands of the mentally ill. Why is Congress deaf to the reality of gun violence? The gun lobby pours millions into attack ads against Congressman who are not in lock-step with the NRA, that's why. So while children cower in the closets of their classrooms, our Congressmen cower in the safety of the safest building in the country, the Capital. Shame on all of them. , 6 Every time school shootings or mass shootings happen we get outraged, politicians send perfunctory \u201cour prayers are with you\u201d messages to the families of the victims, and then life goes on. \n\nWe blame the politicians because they are afraid to lose their seats in Congress. But polls show that 80 percent of Americans want to ban assault rifles. However, polls also showed that Hillary Clinton would win the White House. \n\nAnd, to be sure, many politicians WILL lose their seats because a large segment of the population see these massacres as the cost of Second Amendment freedoms. , 6 Crowd fund a campaign in districts where congressmen take NRA money.\n1) Establish the congressmen who take NRA money?\n2) Poll people in their districts to understand what their constituents are willing to vote for and against in regards to gun laws.\n3) Craft a legislative response that can pass in these districts ahead of time.\n4) Tell constituents who is opposed to such legislation, and who is in favor.\n5) Ask constituents if they know how much money their representative takes from the NRA.\nAnyone?, 6 But,but,but....Second Amendments, protecting ourselves against the Government...my right to shoot defenseless animals...how dare you restrict my right to own military grade weapons and large volume magazines?!!!  This is 1776!!!, 6 Perhaps we need 170 innocents slaughtered, or 1700, before Americans will come to their senses?, 6 Next time someone tells you we need unfettered access to guns to ward off government tyranny, remind them that Steve Scalise's shooter took up arms against a tyrannical government. So did the man who ambushed and killed 5 police officers in Dallas two summers ago. No one, not even the most ardent gun hoarder, believes they are patriots or heroes. , 6 No words?  How about \"Gun Control\"!!!, 6 Same. Old.\n\nHe should have been put away.\n\nBut liberals and progressives won't hear of it., 6 It's the guns, stupid. Will someone please tell me how many lives have been saved by guns NOT in the hands of law enforcement as opposed to the number of lives that have been taken by guns in those same hands. Time to start registering guns like we do drivers. , 6 It's typical of the New York Times to focus only on the negative aspects of this incident. How about an article showing the positive side: a lot of people make an awful lot of money from the sale of guns.\n\n It would be nice for a change for the Times to publish a list of the Board of Directors of the gun manufacturers, along with a list of investors in these companies, so that we may share their joy., 6 Make the pledge today\n\nI will not vote for any candidate who accepts contributions from the NRA, 6 Once again, thanks to the NRA and our immoral congress and president, you can expect absolutely nothing to be done about this problem. See you next time, probably in a day or two., 6 Once again I repeat: Do not open comments in the first 24 h - at least - after a school shooting.\nBut then within 48 h give us a forum with a listing of school shootings to date, 2018.\nA listing of the exact reactions of the President of the United States of America.\nOfficial statements from the Republican and Democratic parties.\nA new trial format for comments on school shootings using an algorithm to categorize comments. This to help us review the 1000s of comments that will then pour forth. Give us targeted articles each open for comments up to at least 1000 each.\n\nWould this be feasible, I do not know. I will start by examining Times Picks to see if they can be categorized. One goal - to see if comments could help the Democratic Party formulate a policy proposal before the 2018 Midterm election.\nOnly-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com\nDual citizen US SE, 6 Get a young and fiery democrat crazy enough to go up against the NRA: win 2020., 6 The best way to honor the 17 young people and counting who lost their lives in this shooting would be to outlaw all military-style/semi-automatic firearms, permanently, at the federal level. Congress, are you listening? We don't need your worthless \"thoughts and prayers\" after every shooting. We need action!, 6 Sheriff Scott Israel says there are no words.  How about these words:  \u201cwe should not allow civilians to possess military-style guns like the AR-15 and numerous magazines of ammunition?\u201d, 6 My thoughts and prayers go to the families who those whose lives were tragically taken as well as for the injured. May God bring comfort and healing in a times like this. We all have to stay strong and united. We gotta pray for one another and help each other best we can in moments like this.\nIt is just unacceptable that life, this precious thing, can be taken this easy! It must stop. All this killing has to end. Everybody has to participate in the solution, lets stop all this madness and save lives not stay still while more lives are taken before our eyes.\nThis cycle can be stopped. Lets do something to stop this madness.\n#livesmater #stopthiskillings #united #fixamerica, 6 Is it too early to talk about the constant diet of violence that we feed ourselves (because every audience is presumed male) in movies, on TV, in video games to perpetuate male stereotypes of power over others (females) and revenge?  , 6 How long does it take for some to finally acknowledge we have too many guns with too easy access in this country?  And, whatever ever happened to respecting the things that can kill us, like guns?  How on earth does a volatile 18 year-old can get his hands on a AR-15?  And the GD NRA - \"...from my cold dead hands.\"  It just might be - keep it going, and you might get to fall on your own GD sword.  , 6 Thank you Philip Mudd, former F.B.I. and C.I.A. official, who broke down crying on CNN today.  Cried openly on camera, saying he could not talk about why this country is allowing these murders to happen to children.\n\nIf good men will not weep over the murders of children, sanctioned and paid for by the NRA contributions to our worthless Congress, when will they cry?\n\nGod speed, Philip Mudd. , 6 When Congress bans assault weapons\nWhen the NRA no longer controls Republicans\nWhen our children can go to school and not be slaughtered\nAmerica will be great again, 6 Repeal the Second Amendment., 6 Oh.. seriously. don't try to blame this on video games. that's a tired old red herring. Games don't cause this. Movies don't cause this.  Being able to buy an AR-15 like a bag of skittles is causing this., 6 There have been 18 school shootings in the first 45 days of 2018.\n\nIsn't it time to stop the insanity!?  \n\nAnd isn't it time for all politicians to stop accepting NRA blood money?, 6 Marco Rubio, as of last  October, has received more than $3,3 million dollars from the National Rifle Association. He sold out our children\u2019s safety In order to remain in power to do the NRA\u2019s dirty work in Congress. This is what corruption looks like in the USA. , 6 A nation is truly lost when it cannot protect it's children. Pay-offs from the NRA to utterly corrupted politicians will deny any remedy other than \"thoughts and prayers\". Disgusting., 6 C;mon. I have a few words after every shooting. Stupid. Avoidable in akk other modern democracies.. Familes of all victims need to file class actions against authorities for negligence due to their failure to govern competently to prevent forseeable harm.\nForget politics. Be pragmatic., 6 This will change nothing at all.  In a couple of weeks, if even that something else will supplant this tragedy and a small percentage of the nation will continue to  dictate that mass murder should be made as effortless as possible for the perpetrator of said violence.  This country is 35% plain stupid.  As long as that fact stands, this is just another week in MAGA.   , 6 Please don't publish any photo's of the killer. It's just what they want, and encourages others., 6 We are a mentally-sick country being deceived and conned by a mentally-sick Liar-in-Chief. His game is over. His defenders can no longer continue to defend the indefensible. Those who are paying attention, can predict the empty words which will follow this ongoing disaster.\n\nThis is the end of dishonesty and denials. No more boasting, bull and duplicitous talk. The political games are over. Every empty word spoken from this day forward will be measured and compared to our current reality.  \n\nThere is no fake news here. This is not a reality TV show. Fake-games are over and done. No more shallow words. Real actions tell us what we need to know. More killing of those who kill will not save us from ourselves., 6 To quote The Onion headline: \u2018No Way To Prevent This,\u2019 Says ONLY Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\n\nLet's face it, we are all being held hostage by a bunch of gun nuts, aided and abetted by the GOP., 6 Once again America has demonstrated its sub-North Korean disregard for the lives of our children.  And once again my congressman will do nothing except mouth NRA platitudes.\n\nI'm talking about you, Tom Reed (R-NY 23rd District)., 6 The news media might as well prepare now for duplications of shootings such as the present as the past is repeating itself so often.\nThe United States gun laws are simply stupid.\nThe Constitution was written in a different time for a different purpose and for a country striving for greatness it is just showing how stupid it also can be by allowing the sales of such deadly weapons by the Gun Lobby.\nJust how many more need be killed before the pro gun lobby shed a tear for the dead...?? Every time another excuse. Every time more deaths, sudden, violent, terrible and of innocents.\nMany will say it is too late to do anything about it but the sale of automatic weapons should stop and the ammunition also.\nThe AR-14 is not a hunting rifle it is a murder weapon and the proof is in its use. A weapon of choice for mass murder and slaughter ...and the politicians and gun lovers think of more and more excuses for the human blood it sheds.\nThese are the things that no matter how prosperous the United States professes to be it is NOT great, it is stupid..!!\nFor every person who has suffered loss by weapons such as these you have my sympathies...today and tomorrow.\n\nStan Chun\nWellington. NZ\n15 Feb. 2018., 6 Governor Rick Scott has an A rating from the NRA.\n\nCan some intrepid reporter please ask him how it feels to support unlimited gun rights to slaughter children?\n\nYou have the blood of these 17 and the thousands to come on your hands., 6 Is it time yet to start talking about guns?, 6 Florida's NRA-basked Attorney General, Pam Bondi, ostentatiously sporting a cross around her neck, stood next to Gov. Scott and offered \"prayers\".  If prayer could help, such shootings would not take place.   \n\nThe sheriff, standing next to her, asked citizens to call law enforcement if they saw somebody with a gun.  Florida is an open-carry state.  If everybody reports everybody carrying a gun, how will safety be improved?\n\nWhat's necessary is to outlaw and to confiscate assault weapons and their high-velocity ammo.   Technology whose sole purpose (and design criterion) is to kill human beings rapidly, efficiently, and in large numbers has no place in private hands.  Period.\n\nRepresentatives who vote consistently against this public interest should have no place in government.  Period., 6 I remember,  back in the 1960s and the 1970s this argument used to rage.  Dr. Martin Luther King was a follower of Gandhi and he used to argue that it was never acceptable to use violence for political gain. Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panther Party used to disagree.  They thought that the right of self-defense was a fundamental human right.  I suspect the 200 years from now,  that argument will still be raging.  , 6 Guns are the vectors; sociopaths are the agents. Why is it so difficult to understand?\nEverybody agrees that vector control is essential for the prevention of vector-borne diseases.  Likewise for guns. But the NRA cartel protects the vectors. Absurd!, 6 School slaughters, Trump, Charlottesville, Iraq, Dubya, recession.\nThere is something  wrong and black in the right-wing  psyche, something bitter and harsh, and it backs up a kind of rot into the body politic., 6 America has made a trade.  And continues to make a trade.  Freedom for any idiot to be armed and the cost is the lives of your children.  It is a choice made only by Americans.   Across the world we watch your carnage repeated every few days.  It seems a crazy price to pay.\n\n\"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d     \n\nAustralian Mom, 6 I have become uncomfortably numb by the numskull GOP., 6 Is this time to do something about guns in this country and come up with a sensible gun control plan, or 17 children who were shot today, and will never come home, were not important, Mr Trump?  Mr. Ryan, and Mr. McConnell, do we need to continue losing innocent children on daily basis, before you decide that enough is enough, before you have enough guts to tell the NRA, to take a hike, or 17 deaths are no big deal? How dare you sit on your behinds and do nothing while parents are losing their children, because another crazy person was able to buy a  semi automatic rifle and leave it where his child can get ahold of it and kill his classmates? Perhaps, the money that you got from NRA, and continue to receive, is more important than the life of all these children. SHAME on you., 6 Where are Donald Trump's comments?  What does our President have to say about this latest atrocity?  Driven to tears? , 6 Over 20 school shootings since beginning of year in USA and over 33,000 gun related deaths annually in America.  While visiting U.S. in Daytona Beach, FL we noticed yesterday, while reporting the latest deaths in Florida, Chan 13 (Spectrum) was running ads for Volusia Top Gun Shop!, 6 No gun control and the wild wild west goes on and on. \"load em up and shoot em.\"  Internationally people are staring at America in disbelief. We have violence on the streets, in our churches and violence in our schools ( and even legalized school violence in the mid/south with adults legally assaulting students with wooden weapons). No end in sight, 6 Don't send you kids to school.  Send them to Canada or frankly anywhere else in the developed world.  Shame on you America. , 6 Please, this is not the time to talk about gun control, families are mourning. We\u2019ll talk about it....um....well...never! Says you know who., 6 Seventeen irrelevant citizens, dead. And it will keep coming. The people of the USA must always be made to feel unsafe so they will live in fear, That's how they're controlled. Meanwhile another news cycle to distract hoi polloi from Trump's treason. The USA is disgusting., 6 Your caring dear leader has sent his thoughts and prayers. So that's OK, 6 There seems to have been an extraordinary wave of severe violence in recent months.  Note that there is a quiet war going on in the Republican Party between the Far Right and the Center Right.  The big bone of contention between the Far Right and Center Right is Russia.  The Far Right wants to take Russia in as an ally,  as they did back in the days of the H-word- Stalin Pact,  while the Center Right likes to allege that the Center Left is insufficiently anti-Russian.  I do not see how these two polar opposite positions can coexist in the same party - certainly not for very long.  Historically,  the Center Right has generally been strongly opposed to the Far Right - note Churchill in his opposition to H-word.  But at other times,  the Center Right has played footsie with the Far Right - as when Hindenburg,  a Center Right politician,  appointed H-word as Chancellor of Germany,  Most historians now believe that Hindenburg was senile at the time that he appointed H-word Chancellor.  Anyway,  it was arguably the worst mistake in world history.  So,  it is in this context that this extraordinary wave of violence is occurring.  Note that it is just exactly the use of violence for political gain that separates the Center-Left and the Center Right from the Far Left and the Far Right.  Both of the latter,  think it is OK to use violence for political gain.  , 6 I have submitted my standard comment - no comments during the first 24 h - at least - in which I make a proposal for coverage of the next school shooting. \n\nFront page center in black frame\n\nToday at a school in Parkland, Florida a lone gunman killed 17                                              people.\n\nThe President of the United States responded at 9:50 PM with these words:\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\u2714@realDonaldTrump\nMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\n\nOnly-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com, 6 I\u2019ll ask, rhetorically, whether we\u2019ve had enough yet.  I know the answer.  It appears obvious that this country will never reach its limit of tolerance for outrageous, repulsive, insane behavior.  Yes, America is awash with guns.  But it goes far beyond that.  The ready availability of military-style weaponry is absurd.  No other first world country would ever allow it.  \n\nBut, at its core, this problem is due to our culture of violence.  We live in a savage country; one in which violence is not only tolerated but peddled in every way, shape and form of media.  It is glorified and adulated.  It is ever-present to all ages of our population.  It is ridiculous and naive to expect civilized behavior from our young people when, from the earliest ages, they are inundated with brutality and guns.  Whether music, movies, television, Internet, video games it matters not.  It\u2019s everywhere all the time.\n\nI don\u2019t want to hear one more moronic utterance of \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the victims\u201d.  Anyone who still believes this is the best country in the world is delusional. , 6 Watch what the bots have been tweeting. Look at the timestamps to see how rapid the response was. If there was ever any doubt whose side they are on, just do a search for Nicholas Cruz and you'll see that hundreds of accounts are linking him to Islamic extremism and \"leftist hate groups.\" \n\nThis false information was rapidly spread today and readily accepted by the Fox crowd. Why? Who directed it? Does the NRA have a stake in these massive Russian bot enterprises?, 6 Gun control, gun control, gun control!, 6 The Russians are funding the NRA. What better way to wage war on America than to get us to kill each other? And, the Russians meddle in our elections so that congressmen taking NRA money will win. It's brilliant really., 6 The NRA needs to be held accountable for legitimizing the need for civilians to own AR-15., 6 The NYT and every other news outlet in this country needs to post every single lawmaker that takes NRA dollars and keep this post in the news every single day until laws start changing or they get voted out of office. NRA = DEATH and these lawmakers all have blood on their hands., 6 What America needs is a mind full of common sense and critical thinking.\n.....JUst a Thought!, 6 Brought to you (again) by the NRA and the GOP.  , 6 No one should be denied a gun, right Mr. Trump!, 6 don't bother about building a wall to prevent  people from killing you, you are already doing a great job by yourselves! Bye Bye America, you were my dream, now you have become a nightmare., 6 Thank you gun lobbyist/supporters for allowing ANYONE to have access to firearms.  The shooter was well protected against those dangerous kids with cell phones.  Whew! He was almost snap-chatted., 6 Ban assault weapons., 6 Ok, America, here's the thing: I heard about the shooting during my lunch break while casually surfing the net. And you know what - I ho-hummed and completely ignored it and simply continued to the next story (some bit on summer travel) and then registered for a Euro-rail pass.  And now several hours later I am reminded of the event again as I review the news before my nightly shower and sleep. Yes, that's how normal, so every-day, so routine, and so very ordinary such events have become (like run-of-the mill car accidents) that it doesn't even register anymore . . ., 6 Every politician who worked against Diane Feinstein\u2019s assault weapons ban now needs to resign. Your total lack of morality has literally resulted in the bloody corpses and handicapped bodies of thousands. There are not \u201ctwo sides\u201d to your argument, only the dead, the wounded and their families., 6 I for one am sick and tired of hearing our government officials say, Prayer and Thoughts; and Today is not a day to discuss gun control, it is a day of mourning.  When is the day that we can have our Congressional representatives discuss gun control?  When will they too be sick and tired of these trite phrases that have become meaningless after each one of these school and mass shooting incidents?, 6 No more thoughts and prayers, please.\nAmerica, Not Great, Again.\nAmerica, The Children Die, Again.\nAnd again. and again. and again, and again, and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again. and again.\nWhen is ENOUGH?\nStop.

As a substitute teacher I pointed out unsettling social behavior on the part of a student but it was minimized because the district did not have the time nor the interest in dealing with it.                               Too bad because that where the lunacy in students begin when \u2018odd\u2019 behavior is tolerated and we give slipshod parenting with \u2018hands off\u2019 schooling the opportunity to fester.                                                              The community should influence the raising and care of all children. It\u2019s called In Parentis Loco (in place of the parent)               We can stop the shooters! , 6 I blame the NRA, the GOP and the interpretation of the 2nd Amendment.\nIs the AR-15 a musket?, 6 Reportedly the shooter had an obsession with guns. Should an obsession with guns considered a mental disorder?, 6 Do Republican Congressmen and Senators even have children?  At what point will they stop all this NRA (minority 3 million members) nonsense and pass common sense gun safety?  No one wants to take the good guy's guns away, but this automatic weapon proliferation has to stop.  , 6   And Florida's  governor blames it all on \"Pure evil\" not a mention  of mental illness or firearm restrictions. Hey it's pure evil and what can you do about that? I guess we'll all just prey real hard and bow our heads. Works every time! Till it doesn't. Oh, and the shooter would have qualified as one of the NRA's  \"good guys\" till he wasn't., 6 You have to wait until 21 to have a beer but you can buy guns as soon as you turn 18.  Someone explain it to me. But I know, I know, these are only mentally ill people and, apparently, they all live in our country., 6 I guess Trump, who received over $50,000,000 from the NRA & is leader of the free world and our nation will need a few days and a TelePrompter to come up with an empty spineless televised response to another American Gun Massacre. I am sure it will sound like his very empty and generic twitter response of \"more thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families\".  This is what the family and victims get is a \"TWEET\" from the POTUS an the day of another gun massacre?? A TWEET. No new gun laws  but a TWEET. No solutions to this epidemic. A TWEET. Our countries leadership has officially hit rock bottom & we are all buried deep in this swamp., 6 Chris Cuomo (CNN) was just saying that NOT ONE lawmaker  has accepted an invitation to appear on CNN to talk about what happened yesterday.  These people in Congress are COWARDS and supposedly work for \"we the people.\" We need to vote them OUT!!! Get on the phone, call your \"representatives\"  and inundate them with your outrage and anger!!, 6 \"There are no words\"?? Oh yes there are, just three : BAN SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS., 6 I can't think of any reason that ANYBODY needs a AR-15.  It is just crazy!, 6 I wonder if the people of the Mideast receive our news of the latest U.S. mass shooting like we receive their news of the latest deadly car bomb, with extreme sadness, helplessness and dismay., 6 Congress is guilty. We must go to the polls and throw the bums in the pockets of the NRA out once and for all., 6 \u201cNo child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d\n\nNo, Mr. Trump.  No child, teacher or anyone else should ever BE unsafe in an American school.  Your party's NRA puppet masters promote the opposite., 6 When 17 studenys die, and untold others are wounded, Twitter is not where a president's address to the nation should appear  \n\nLeadership is not that easy., 6 The coward in the white house won't go near any of these tragic scenes to offer condolence or hope for change. The NRA has a hold on the GOP.  Their solution, thoughts and prayers to the families.  But let's round up all the brown people, build a wall and keep the bad one's out, because they're the one's who have been committing these mass shootings/bombings going back to Tim McVeigh and Columbine...NOT.  Disgusting. , 6 PRESIDENT AS USUAL ON THE MISSING LIST WHEN IT COMES TO SPEAKING OUT .... it makes you wonder if his son was one of the slain things would be slightly different.....ummm, 6 If this had happened during Obama's presidency, he would have been meeting immediately with the victims' family members as his role as Consoler-in-Chief.  Does anyone think Trump will do this?  Of course not.  Thant would conflict with his plans to play golf over the long Presidents' Day weekend., 6 One has to wonder what the political reaction would be if 430 students died from illnesses caused after attending an asbestos infected school.\n\nTrump twitters \u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d and others offer very similar comments.  \n\nTake your prayers and condolences and shove them where the sun doesn't shine.  DO SOMETHING!, 6 They keep talking about out founding fathers and the Constitution. Well, some of you present day mothers need to stand up for gun control. Unless you  want to continue to see your sons and daughter murdered. , 6 Every school shooting has 1 thing in common - perscription Psychiatric drugs . The Vegas shooter also ....  homicidal thoughts is a side effect listed ... , 6 We abolished slavery\nWe abolished prohibition\nWe need to abolish the second amendment\nThere is no other way, just keep saying it,\nWe need to abolish the second amendment, there is no other way !, 6 All American law makers have blood on their hands., 6 Thoughts and prayers, anyone?, 6 Write to your Legislator.\nWrite again.\nWrite again.\nWrite again.\nWrite again.\nWrite until this ends., 6 This is on you, Republican members of Congress.  This is on you conservative voters who keep voting for these NRA and gun industry minnions. This is on you members of the NRA, silent accomplices . Then again, if Sandy Hook did not touch these people's souls..., 6 Maybe if we arm each student, this would never have happened? Good thing the Russians are funding  the NRA and Republicans in Congress. Soon, all our schools will be killing fields. Who needs gun control when Republicans  can get some much real time entertainment on the internet? Thanks Republicans!, 6 It didn't take long for the GOP online trolls and operatives to start linking the shooter to Antifa and a number of other left-wing groups. Anything to deflect and take the heat off of themselves., 6 Parents are not supposed to send their children to schools to die, 6 Abolish slavery, check\nAbolish prohibition, check\nAbolish segregation, check\nAbolish second amendment, yes please ! ASAP !, 6 Good morning to everyone ! God is good , isn\u2019t He?\nIt\u2019s heart breaking to see and hear about the tragedy yesterday in Parkland Florida! So sorry for the survivors and families that lost their children.\nAs a nation we must prayer for our country and the people whom God has placed as leaders.\nI feel laws have to be changed to protect our children in public schools. I\u2019m aware of the 2nd Amendment but Government must protect our innocent children by requiring all schools to have proper security , even if it becomes inconvenient , but children and adults should not have weapons in schools and I also feel just as our airports have scanners so something should be done before entrance into school property . That should be a no brainer with so many mass killings in our schools in the last 20 years.\nIf you agree please share but we must definitely pray!\nIt\u2019s someone\u2019s else kids today but may be yours next. As citizens of this great country we have the responsibility for our generation and to make our voice heard.\nA song by Don Moen has touched me and how he got the words . The song @ GOD WILL MAKE A WAY\u201d. I do not know what you are experiencing this very moment but I know God knows and cares! Please read the following and listen to the song which follows!\nHave a blessed day!\n\nStory behind the song: 'God Will Make a Way'\nA tragedy of epic proportions was the background for the writing of Don Moen's most influential song. Don related to me the story behind his song:\nSTAUGUSTINE.COM, 6 The NRA and reality meet again as the insanity known as America continues it's march over the cliff of civilization. , 6 ok but how many illegal immigrants were rounded up and deported?  , 6 The paranoid mentality of many Americans makes it unlikely that anything will change, no matter how many more mass shootings occur. A great many Americans truly, honestly believe that the one factor above all separating the U.S. from a country like North Korea is the existence of almost completely unregulated mass gun ownership in the former. \n\nIf you believe that unregulated mass gun ownership somehow acts as a check upon government power, you will end up tolerating mass shootings on a daily or even hourly basis no matter where they occur. The NRA is absolutely guilty of instilling this kind of thinking in the minds of its members--telling them directly or indirectly that their stockpiles of weapons will come in handy when the need to fight Washington comes. , 6 Just think what the results would have been like if this shooter had gotten a hold of some bump stocks., 6 It there is no other way to describe this shooting as yet another GOP failure to do something of meaningful intent regarding sensible gun control. They are the political party fully responsible for the endless and senseless killings of our nations unsuspecting children and adults. Enough is enough. The GOP is soulless., 6 I can not describe the feelings I have now about this.\nAll those children , yes children, killed at school.\nWhat kind of society are we leaving in.\n\nYes , the gun problem. It is there. But also the bullying. The violence idealization through movies. \n\nThe way kids behave. The way we allow  bullying.  Yes it is in part our fault.\nParents fault.  The way we consume . The way we don\u00b4t  participate in their lifes. \n\n18 shootings  in schools this year ?  \n\nWe need a profound  examination in our society and its values.\n\nGun control,  values,  how we behave with children .  We need all that !, 6 Americans, it is heartbreaking to see your children murdered by your own weapons and laws. I have two children aged 17 and18 and I cried today because it drives me crazy just that the lives of boys and girls like them have been broken because of irresponsible adult parents who continue to support senseless laws on the possession of firearms. It is no longer time to pray. It's time to take action now. Give up your mad race to arms. Depose them and unite with a hug to your brothers in Europe who suffer terribly from your losses., 6 Is America great again yet?  I can't tell.., 6 \"Thoughts and prayers\" from Trump and the Republicans. , 6 Keep praying. I\u2019m sure that will prevent more mass shootings. , 6 Two mass shootings in one week. Instead of sensible legislation, Congress is trying to pass a \"Guns Everywhere\" bill. This is a sick country., 6 An edited version of the President's tweet:\n\n\"My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel (delete un-) safe in an American school.\", 6 GUN CONTROL IS A CIVIL RIGHT., 6 Yesterday I noted that Life expectancy in America in bottom rung of Western democracies becuase of morbidity and mortality related to unrestricted gun ownership. \n\nToday David Leonhardt, Oped Columnist NYT,  notes that Journal Health Affairs states that the United States has become, \"the most dangerous of wealthy nations for a child to be born\".\n\nFebruary 28, 2017: TRUMP SIGNS BILL REVOKING OBAMA-ERA GUN CHECKS FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.\n\nThere are no enhanced gun control background checks in United States and none proposed as of today. This is not a 2nd amendment violation., 6 Guns reinforce people's fear of the other and are a simple answer for self preservation.   Until society has a one on one conversation attempting to lessen the fear of the other and collectively decides that guns cannot be readily available, nothing will change. , 6 This was written by \"William\" William Memphis 12 hours ago\nIn the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last TWENTY YEARS.\nIn the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1st ... just 35 days.\n\nAMERICANS need to find out why the rest of the world doesn't do this, but we do. There is something wrong and hitting the NRA gong over and over is not solving anything.  We need to know why this is happening now and here.  Families have always had guns - maybe not insane high tech, and surely certain bullets belong only in the military and should be illegal for an \"ordinary\" person to purchase, but we need to look past the NRA \"argument\" - it's not helping and we need to know why here in the US we are doing this and in the rest of the world (where access to guns might even be easier...).\nSomething has shifted in this country and it's not this president, because the other events happened before so the blame has to be laid at our feet.  We Americans are failing each other somehow.  Finger pointing is not getting us anywhere except more shootings.\nBut what do i know, except bless those who have been stolen by such horrifying events.  The suffering is too unbearable. , 6 The problem is not guns. It is the psychological despair and destruction as a result of social media and technology. Life has been reduced to a subservient role to technology. It is getting worse continuously. The problem has been defined by social experts. Minimal attention is being given to this, probably because the media and business use it as a tool of their own agenda. The biggest problem of our time. Will surely get worse. Get you and your loved ones out of this space., 6 To really do something about this problem, the citizens need to act.  Every person who is in favor of gun legislation should join the NRA, get rid of the current leadership and direct NRA funding to politicians who support reasonable legislation.  \n\nThe NRA is a powerful lobby for gun manufacturers, not citizens who own guns..., 6 As the Repubs (RUBIO for one) say they don't know what happened, let me tell them how  A person, with A GUN, walked into a school, took out his GUN and pulled the trigger on THE GUN, and THE GUN started SHOOTING BULLETS. THE GUN and THE BULLETS killed many young people., 6 Yet another example of a violent, mentally ill killer, known to law enforcement, left at large among us.  Of course, many will go for the simplistic solution and blame the gun.  When will people face up to the ugly reality that we being failed by the mental health establishment and law enforcement?, 6 I don't blame guns.  I don't blame Republicans.  I don't blame Democrats.  I don't blame the NRA.  I don't blame TV.  I don't blame video games.  But it is time to ban semi-automatics.  , 6 The clock is ticking until the next horror story. It will not go away unless something is done. Tick, Tick, Tick.........., 6 At this rate we'll have another 128 school shootings by the end of 2018., 6 The land of the free is being terrorized by the gun lobby., 6 Those legislators who fail(ed) to stem to tidal wave of guns are complicit and have blood on their hands., 6 How about our country staging a march with the signs\nStop Guns Now!, 6 Repbulicans are claiming its \"too soon\" to discuss sensible gun legislations. Sadly for these 17 young souls, its too late.\n\nBan assault type weapons NOW, it has been proven to be the weapon of choice for mass murderers., 6 \"Prayers and condolences\" - the favorite homily of every Republican politician in the country. Every time you hear it, you know that some innocent people have been killed by a gun in the hand of a nut. How about some action on gun control for a change?, 6 Blame Republicans who vote 100 percent with NRA and get tens of millions of dollars not to support meaningful gun reform. The guy is sick but there are sick people in every country but only the USA has a massive mass murder problem by lone gunman who can get weapons super easily versus every other country in the world.  Cause and effect, 6 \u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d President Trump wrote on Twitter.\nWe won't hear anything better than that from Congress... Democrat or Republican. We are the only developed country in the world where such automatic weapons proliferate life this. No one will stand up to the gun lobbies. It's a national shame., 6 I'm sure Repubs will offer \"thoughts and prayers\" rather than anything meaningful. Sigh., 6 By now most Americans are completely inured to this daily massacre at our public schools.\n\nIt's all too easy to blame violent video games yet a moment's thought discloses that every single one of the school massacres since the Declaration of Independence has been at a public school. And private school students play video games too.\n\nThe difference is that public school children go to school because they have to; private school children go to school because they want to and because their parents want to send them there.\n\nMuch as I despise video games and what they have done to rot the brains of our children, my sense is that the cause of these massacres is not bad video games but bad parents.  While much discussion after each of these incidents focuses on the heinous gun lobby, we need to look closer to home., 6 Republican and their NRA sponsors talking points after a mass shooting:\n\n1) our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families\n2) now is not the time to talk about gun control\n3) if it wasn\u2019t for the bravery and quick response of our first responders it could have been a lot worse\n4) radio silence until the initial hysteria blows over and then a staunch defense of the second amendment , 6 It is time for a national referendum on semiautomatic weaponry.  The NRA is not the heart of the American public, nor are the rabid, outspoken gun's for everyone contingent.  Congress does nothing.  The people must put a stop to this nightmare., 6 And sure as an \u201cAmen\u201d in church there will be prayers offered by members of Congress - and total inaction on gun-control. The NRA will eep buying politicians who will keep making stupid comments about \u201cfreedom\u201d.\nWho needs these prayers? Who needs AR-15 style rifles? America, how many more youngsters have to die before you start valuing your children higher than a completely misinterpreted 2nd amendment?\nWe mourn with you. If only our mourning could help those poor families, that a pathetically wrong understanding of freedom now destroyed., 6 I am totally opposed to public school mass shootings. Totally., 6 \"Troubled kid\" - what an easy, simple and terrible label for a teen who killed 17 kids.\nHave we not gotten into trouble when we were young? It did not lead us to go kill people\nIf like the majority of the country; we believe in the the excessive availability of guns; let's call it just that\nOpioids, social media, big tobacco.., 6 The USA turns the key in the lock of the front door of its home and walks in down the hall to its living room to find Canada and the other nations of the wealthy democratic world sitting down there. \"What's going on?\" it says. Australia replies by saying \"Sit down US.  We're here because we're worried about you and we love you. We don't think you're coping well with your responsibilities and ....\".   , 6 The victims of these mass shootings need to sue Congress for wrongful death. Completely foreseeable that people will be murdered when when there are no limits on guns and who can buy them. This country has a sickness at its core. , 6 People read about a guy on social media who is always a problem, repeatedly suspended, says he will kill, etc. The guy is in crisis and no one reports a thing.  This tragic incident could have been avoided.  And for those who insist it is all guns: there is always dynamite, bombs, or driving a car/truck into a crowd.  When evil/sick people want to kill they will find a way; guaranteed., 6 \u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting.\u201d These were Trump's words and notable for their lack of the more pious \"prayers\" for the dead and wounded. Can there be any hope Trump will accomplish what no president more recent than Bill Clinton did with his assualt weapon ban? , 6 Congress, all together now:  \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with victims and their families.\u201d  OK.  Duty done for another month or so.\n\nNRA:  \u201cMake it mandatory for every American above the age of five to be armed with a loaded gun.\u201d  Only then will America be safe.\u201d\n\nAmerica, alone amongst all countries on earth, suffers from a pandemic of mental illness.  It must be the water.\n\nOur revered Supreme Court justices, past and present notwithstanding, anyone with a primary school education and a dictionary understands the 2nd Amendment does not endow Americans with a carte blanche right to bear arms (\u201ca well regulated militia\u201d).  \n\nHow long did it take to curb smoking?  To provide universal suffrage?  To end slavery?  It took a long, long time in each case but that did not stop the United States from doing them.  And so it is time to do the same with guns.   Lock them up in privately owned/operated arsenals (no big bad government involvement).  If you want to hunt, target practice, or go on a rampage, you check them out for one week max, and then check them back in.  \n\nThe Feds (Sessions) intend to regulate (ban) marijuana but not guns?  Go figure.  , 6 Until the voters demand action from their representatives, to limit the easy availability of weapons of mass destruction (semi-automatic rifles and bullets), we will clearly continue to have mass shooting after mass shooting after mass shooting. Sandy Hook and Las Vegas taught us that there is no mass shooting grotesque enough to change easy gun and ammunition access unless the voters demand it. The politicians will do nothing but offer thoughts and prayers - even when their own are victims!; the NRA will do nothing but advocate that all people of all ages be armed, with their guns locked and loaded at all times and in all places - the more guns the better! We\u2019ve seen this story time after time after time. Nothing will change until the voters demand it. If you are a voter, and you are unhappy with the level of gun violence in your community, hold your representatives accountable!, 6 Greed and corruption own the government and the country., 6 What is needed is armed security guards that could put a stop to this before these shooters get started! and if there would be a couple times where the shooter was shoot before he killed anybody and if the news would cover that with the same coverage I believe the shootings would plummet! , 6 There is a war going on in our country, a guerrilla war in which dissatisfied young people, people with mental illness, sideliners, and others are shooting and killing our children. This has been going on for years now and our government is doing nothing about it. If we don't agree on some kind of gun control as well as ways to address underlying problems in our society with care and compassion, we are going to become a country in defeat. , 6 Will there be a point where the GOP realizes this is too easy and come to its senses about guns?  At this moment they\u2019re advancing a law that will make it legal to cross state lines and kill people, making concealed carry \u201creciprocal\u201d meaning if you have a permit in Florida, you can ignore the law everywhere else and carry your gun across state lines.  And the NRA doesn\u2019tgive A hoot about anyone\u2019s ability to protect themselves, all they want is to sell more guns. Period.  , 6 These families and the surviving students will always live with the knowledge the adults didn't protect them.  Those of us who wanted gun control couldn't protect them.  Those who wanted guns freely in every hand did not protect them but campaigned relentlessly for this repeating carnage.  \n\nHow I resent the people who allow this to happen.  My son is a teacher.  And my life is filled with worry and anxiety over what might happen to him and his students.  And he would be a teacher who would sacrifice his life to protect them.\n\nThis country is so sick, so insane and so uncaring, so CRIMINAL to allow this to continue.  Our children are being murdered and we, the angry helpless, cannot stop it.  Put guns in hands and those hands pull the triggers. Guns have no other purpose than to kill. Video games don't kill.  Guns kill.  Simple.  Kindergarten logic., 6 The Russians are debating which was the better investment, helping Trump or helping the NRA., 6 Calhoun County Michigan Democrats are working to get Justin Amash out of office. HE is he founder of the 2nd amendment caucus and refuses to protect children from gun carnage. Voters MUST take action, do not vote for anyone who will not restrict gun sales. It's up to the voters of this country to step up and not elect people that won't protect our children., 6 I teach in Broward Country, less than 21 miles from this school. I can only pray., 6 What would happen  in this country if a politician ran for public office with a passion to ban assault weapons that equaled Trump's passion  for banning Muslims and refugees? , 6 This student made threats against others in the past and was not be allowed on the campus with a backpack.\n\ntrump, on the other hand, targets ISIS and MS-13 in his attempt to find Willy Horton while a US Citizen kills his own from a hotel in Las Vegas and a \"student\" kills his classmates.\n\nI feel safe., 6 Blame video games. Blame liberals. Blame crazy people. But oh no, let's not actually do anything about it.\n\nThe number will never be high enough. Could be 200 tomorrow, NOTHING WILL GET DONE. Vote for people who \"promise\" they will fight for gun control laws. That's the only lame option we have. , 6 President Trump tweeted \u201cNo child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d \n\nHowever, Page 719 of President Trump\u2019s FY 2019 budget, released three days ago, provides a 16% cut to grant programs to help states do gun background checks. \n\nAnd as the President told guns rights advocates gathered in Atlanta in late April 2017: \u201cThe eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end. [You] have a true friend and champion in the White House. I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Never ever.\u201d\n\nHow will these cuts and these statements make children, teachers or anyone else feel safer in American schools, Mr. President?, 6 And the followup horror is that nothing, absolutely nothing will be done...because, above all else, above our children and above life itself...we pledge allegiance to our guns.  Please stop these token, empty  and meaningless 'thoughts and prayers'.   Anyone with a modicum of sense should make it clear to their legislators they will not receive  a vote if they support the NRA.  And don't hide behind the antiquated 2nd amendment- it's outdated-change it., 6 At least 20 others have remarked upon the \"thoughts & prayers\" shibboleth.  Here's what I think: \n\nthe \"thoughts\" are those of the thoughtless. \n\nthe \"prayers\" are futile -- no One is paying any attention.  \n\nWe know very well how to stop this insanity: get rid of the guns.  , 6 The thoughts and prayers of Senator Rubio and Governor Scott just aren't enough to keep Florida safe! It's a sad, cloudy day here in Florida...Thankfully Senator Nelson had the spine to speak the plain truth last night!, 6 As a consumer of news, i can't read beyond the headline on these US gun violence stories anymore. i used to read further, but i cant anymore. it is not out of not caring, it is simply a disgusting, thing that no matter what, the government will not act. The US government does not value their own peoples lives., 6 Last night my husband and I were discussing whether we were still proud to be Americans.  Regrettably the answer is now no.  We live in a country where greed is worshipped and fear is stoked.  We have a government that wastes millions if not billions of dollars in the pursuit of destroying rivals (endless, useless hearings) rather than addressing the real problems of decaying infrastructure, inadequate healthcare and GUNS.  We elected a racist, ignorant, vulgar dolt to the (formerly) most revered office in the world and enable him because he pursues the goals of the oligarchs.  Frankly, taking a knee at a sporting event is a mild form of protest for the shameful state we now find our selves in.  We have seen the enemy and it is us., 6 So, is Trump \"totally opposed\" to mass shootings? Will it take him a week to make up his mind on this one?, 6 florida govenor rick scott has trotted out\n the usual, referring to the incident as\n\u201cpure evil\u201d\nthis phrase has been used before after mass shootings\n It doesnt refer to a specific law or culpability\nand places blame on an unknowable entity.\nalmost like these guys have been coached about what to say., 6 Why is Trump not making us safe again?, 6 Let's face it: America is a violent country. Your Hollywood products glorify violence, sex and drugs. Kids are surrounded by violent images and content on social media. The most popular video games are violent. Your \"recipe for disaster\" is an unsupervised kid with time on his hands and mental issues and who fantasizes about hurting people, for whatever reason.  Expect more of this. Gun laws will not prevent this from happening again. There has to be a fundamental social shift that does not glorify war, killing, and angry role models. Meanwhile, this will get much, much worse...., 6 Kids were defenseless and a tragic event occurred BUT the voters of this country need to wake up or we are all sitting ducks for whatever nut legally buys a military style weapon. This has been said over and over. Pretty soon we won't be surprised there are victims., 6 I don't care. I just don't care any more. This is our reality now., 6 If the NRA money stranglehold on Republican Congress can't be broken, we should amend the Constitution. That's right. Get rid of the archaic Second Amendment and the hypocrisy it engenders. I personally could care less about hunters, but they never speak out on the overreach of having everyone have any type of weapon. Americans also should have rights not to be gunned down by any weapon in schools, churches, supermarkets, concerts, restaurants, nightclubs, or anywhere in the public space. , 6 (I love US and have my close folks in US) . .Put all the Nobels in sciences and economics of US on one table and  put all the school gun incidents on the other table and ask an Alien -or other world citizens - is US a wise tribe? Time for US to reflect.., 6 Quick, someone create a Florida graphic so we can all place it on our social media pages to make ourselves feel better!, 6 Governor Rick Scott is complicit, along with every politician who has accepted campaign contributions from the NRA.  Any law-abiding owner of an AR-15 is also complicit.  No one needs to won an AR-15., 6 I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the NRA and gun manufacturers everywhere. Well done, another mass shooting offering up the opportunity for the NRA and its dues paying members to justify running out and buying more guns! We all feel much better this morning knowing we are just hours away from another \"gun salesman\" upping the ante, seeing if he (or she, we want to be gender neutral, after all gals love guns too!) can knock off more concert goers or school children than the last NRA hero. Yes, today is a day to celebrate, more mayhem, more gun sales! Only in America, back on the road to greatness., 6 AR-15 is not the bad guy here.  I disturbed young man, who showed all the signs of being dangerous and was ignored, is the bad guy here.  How bout not passing passing gun bans for the sake of action and actually pass something that is effective.  Metal Detectors in all schools and armed security sounds more useful than anything I have seen proposed.  Crazed murderers will always find a way and  gun bans will never prevent that., 6 If there was no second amendment there would still likely be guns in this country.  The curse of the amendment is that fundamentalists now see gun ownership as a right without limitations.  And while I'm at it, if all people who support abortion can be called baby killers - can we start calling all people who support guns just straight out - killers?, 6 Repeal the Second Amendment.  Allow the People  the right to self defense through reasonable gun laws that would provide for a well regulated malitia., 6 My heart is broken. That we can actually do things to stop these horrors but simply choose not to do so, that is the truly saddest thing of all., 6 Here we go again.  Families shattered, children traumatized.  Again and again and again.  How many times will this continue to happen?  And our elected officials solemnly offer their impotent \"thoughts and prayers\" and wait for the news cycle to change.  Shame on all of you for not standing up to the gun lobby.  We need to address this issue now.  , 6 If only the students were armed, none of this would have happened., 6 Thank goodness the law enforcement officers were armed with military grade weapons., 6 The pain here in Florida today is - again - unbearable. May the young high school students who were shot to death rest in peace.  We weep for them for their parents, grandparents, and loved ones, for the horrible gun culture of America and its threat to Democracy under a terrible president., 6 Enough, enough, enough!!!\n\nWil no politician from either party, will no legislative body rise up and end this senseless 'killing machine rifle/gun/weapon use' as any advanced countries do?\n\nWe are losing our young and innocent and our own sense of basic safety in our schools, hotels, malls throughout every facet of our lives., 6 I am totally tired of hearing \u201cofficials\u201d expounding on what happened at the recent school shooting in Florida WITHOUT mentioning the ELEPHANT in the room, GUNS, specifically assault rifles.  They also do not blame the one organization who is responsible for these deaths, the NRA.  The NRA has bought and paid for our US Congress and State legislatures and told them to vote against gun control.   , 6 Thanks so much for that heartfelt tweet, President Trump. Now wait for the next step--an NRA yahoo calling for the arming of America's schools.\n\nThe Government, the NRA, owes it to past and current grieving families and future targets to stop pretending some federal agent is coming after your hunting rifle, and tightly control weapons of mass murder., 6 What will it take to finally get our elected officials to pass stricter gun regulations?  How many more massacres need to occur?  What is wrong with our country?, 6 There was one Times reporter on the scene and 11 others who contributed from afar.  You never see that in even the most complex of cases.  I have no idea what the 11 in New York and DC contributed to this article.  But this article uses up resources at the Times more than a Trump impeachment would.  Inquiring minds would like to know why. , 6 And the talking heads in DC will be mumbling the usual platitudes about \u201cthoughts and prayers \u201c - and NOTHING will get done., 6 Why is anybody the least bit surprised... It's just another shooting... Tomorrow there will be another. I live in the Middle East, in a country that does not have shootings because - surprise! - residents do not have guns. , 6 Platitudes from politicians are not acceptable. You were elected to act!  SO ACT!, 6 I'll buy the argument that everyone has the right to bear arms including semi-automatic rifles when we also allow private individuals to buy or develop nuclear weapons (modern-day arms). What could possibly go wrong with that?  What are you, anti-freedom, or something?  If we can allow semi-automatic rifles, why can't we allow nukes?  Can someone explain the difference to me?  These are all arms, and ownership of them are protected in the Constitution.  \n\nUnless they can explain why private ownership of one kind of \"arms\" is acceptable, but ownership of another kind of \"arms\" is not, gun rights activists need to just admit to being a) ignorant or b) crooked and corrupted by gun lobby money. , 6 If Las Vegas didn\u2019t move the needle, what chance is there with this? Sad., 6 First, My deepest painful sympathies to those who have suffered in this massacre, No matter what we say you are alone in your grief.  Parents should never bury their children.\nWhat will we learn from this.\nFirst this school was not prepared.  We practice these drills, lock downs where fire alarms went off.  More importantly I have a contingency plan for my classroom, because I understand the weakness of our drills, (due to the structure of my classroom.\nBut the culpability does not rest with the school.  We are a sick society.  We have put the right to own guns ahead of public safety. The accomplices to this crime in the gun lobby have done everything possible to make these a regular occurrence.  CDC can't even collect information study the problem.  the right to militia has become so distorted that our founders would not recognize it.\nSo know the Kabuki theater begins.  We will build a really great monument to the victims, but its really a testament to the NRA.  Some people will call for new legislation, and the gun lobby will spit out its worn out lines.  Guns don't kill people, people kill people.  If only their was a good guy with a gun. etc.  But remember its math. simply math.  More guns oer-capita than any society on earth=more gun violence.  But who believes facts any more, 6 Forget the empty thoughts and empty prayers. where's the anger? where's the anti-NRA movement? There will always be mental instability. Combine that with access to all types of guns, this is what you get. America apparently does not want to modify this recipe. To paraphrase Gail Collins, to vote for an NRA-approved candidate is to be complicit in gun violence.   , 6 No worries. Thoughts and prayers will be sent out and it will all be forgotten in a couple days, just like the previous shootings.\nBill O\u2019Reilly called it the \u201cprice of freedom.\u201d\nAmerican exceptionalism indeed., 6 There is an irony to me about the Right's insistence that we do not enact stricter gun control laws around this country. How does someone claim to value \"life\" and restrict women's capacity to make informed decisions about their own bodies in the name of life, but then do nothing about weapons that to date have contributed to the needless deaths of at least 400 people (since 2000). The hypocrisy of these people is astonishing. But none of us should be surprised by their hypocrisy  given that it is many of these same people who elected and defend a racist, ignorant president. Moreover, it is these very same people who support organizations that encourage a violent gun culture. It is t rule sad that Democrats can currently do nothing to stop this violence. But hopefully, the 2018 election will shift the power structure, and after 2020 we can enact legislation to stop these horrific incidents from occurring, at least to such an extant as they currently do. , 6 We've been through this before. But wait--isn't owning a cache of weapons including automatic rifles a God-Given greater American right? Ask your congressman! Ask the gun lobby!\nAnd don't forget, in the midterm, to support those who are direct and honest about this. Our letters won't make much change but our representatives (sic) theoretically could., 6 I would never visit this place the United States where you can be slaughtered by guns in any public place--stay out of war zones! Vacation in a safe country, like Japan, where you could probably leave your wallet on a park bench and go back 24 hours later and it would still be there.\n\nDarn I can't visit the United States, unfortunately I live in this war zone.  And apparently the republicans want it to continue. So the GOP allows mass slaughter just to get NRA funds. Now that is \"pure evil.\", 6 A country that allows this unrelenting thud of death to repeat almost every day is not civilized. It's neither developed nor developing; it is just barbarian., 6 What more evidence do we need?  The NRA is a subversive organization.\nIt collaborated with Russia according to reliable reports.\nIt has repeatedly influenced Congress not to act despite all the mass killings.\nit has flooded our country with weapons of mass destruction.\nSo where is this criminal?  Not in Korea, Not in Russia, not in Syria or Libya nor in Vietnam.  It is right here.   It exists in our peaceful neighborhoods, our schools, our grocery stores, our theaters.  , 6 What will it take for Congress to ban military weapons from retail sale?  Representative Scalese nearly lost his life.  But then, it took centuries for Congress to put warnings on tobacco products.  These psychopaths will send out brave men and women to die in battles that for them are wars of political and financial  gain.  Why do we continue to elect murders?, 6 From the country that outlawed assault rifles after a mass shooting in 1996 and has not had one since, I listened as Governor Rick Scott of Florida mouthed the usual platitude \"pure evil\". Yes, that Governor Scott, the one with the A+ NRA rating, the one who bragged about passing five (!!) pro gun laws in 2014 and the same old line about more attention to mental illness. The pure evil is the hypocrisy and NRA-funded disinterest in doing anything about gun laws or mental illness.  , 6 Why can't America take care of its children? Guns, pornography, phones and the whole panoply of screen-based mind rot we deliver unto them. And no government worthy of the name, in fact fleeing all government. What happened to in the name of the people, by the people, for the people? Isn't the interests of the child the one thing we can all agree on and go from there?, 6 Exactly what you'll get from the right,no words other than prayers and condolences., 6 As a physician, I don't want prayers. I want scientific information regarding the extent, pattern, causes and solutions to gun violence. But, guess what? The Centers for Disease Control -- our primary public health institution -- is FORBIDDEN by Congressional directive to collect ANY data regarding gun violence. Why, you ask, would Congress like us to be completely ignorant of the numbers??? (Hint: you can thank the NRA and the domestic armaments industry.) Fortunately, a few states such as mine (Oregon) are collecting gun violence data. The results are amazing. I'll leave it to you to look it up -- IF you'd like to be educated instead of sticking your head in the sand and saying meaningless \"prayers\" for endless victims., 6 If guns aren't allowed in the White House or the U.S. Capitol - as of course they shouldn't be - why are they allowed anywhere?, 6 Eight school shootings already in 2018. The US has become one sick society., 6 Another triumph of the AR 15. How good that we have such weapons. Except that mankind makes a poor appearance on this planet., 6 Thoughts, prayers and condolences. That\u2019s all they have to offer. Where in the Constitution does it say that anyone can own a gun that is designed only to kill people. These guns need to be banned, appropriated and destroyed. The entire country is complicit in this ongoing slaughter , 6 35 days into 2018 & 18 school shootings.  One every other day.  This country is sick & won\u2019t take its medicine.  You expel someone from school & where do you send them?  You let them get a gun?  An assault rifle?  You let them back into your school?  We have spy agencies that collects data on innocent citizens & doesn\u2019t pursue disturbing social media posts?  What are they doing with data?  What ate they looking for?  Why are these disturbing images not reported by  those who see it to the local police or FBI?  Why does Mark Zuckerberg allow these pictures on his instagram platform & other media platforms?  Why do Parents send their children to a building with no security when every other day the President of this country, their Senators, Congresspeople, Governors, Mayors, and school boards allow these buildings to become a slaughterhouse?  Why doesn\u2019t this sick country admit its disease & take its medicine? , 6 If politicians are too gutless to do anything about the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S., maybe it's time American society starts going after the NRA and firearm manufacturers through the legal system the way they went after Big Tobacco with class action lawsuits and multi-billion dollar fines, and eventually won., 6 Trump wants to build a wall to keep illegals out. Now he will say, build a wall around school to keep bad people out.\nMake us safer at home first.. then worry about borders, which are more safer then our own school in our backyard., 6 What's to say after these horrible things happen? The NRA controls the Republican Party. The Republican Party controls the government. That's it; until things are different, nothing will happen., 6 Tell your wife or husband, mom or dad, sister or brother, girlfriend or boyfriend you love them each morning before they leave. You may never see them again.In the Wild Wild West more commonly known as America, this is our reality. We are all just sitting ducks out here and each day one of us could be next. The irony is that each time this happens people cry, people pray (no one is listening by the way) people complain and still nothing changes.  The Republicans refusal to make any changes to gun legislation after 26 died, 20 of whom were children, is proof positive they simply do not care. Why? It's not their children who are dying. Its just that simple. They simply do not care. Who among us will be next? , 6 In Germany possession of a guns is restricted by very strict rules. We have had a few such killings here too, but much less often than in the US. If it happened, it mostly was because a mentally unstable young person got access to a weapon of a father or in the dark net. The NRA and the US politics are responsible for these killings, maybe even more than a mentally unstable young man running amock! It is the gun that kills and rules must make it as difficult as possible for the wrong guys to use it!, 6 As usual when these regular unspeakable tragedies happens in America the media fills up with endless excuses about video games and culture of violence. Do these commentators really believe that young people in the rest of the world do not play these games, or how do they explain the American bias?, 6 A non-relative, hitherto unknown person with schizophrenia has resided with me for years.  In a court incident, the judge offered transfer to \u201ccommunity court\u201d but he rejected it, and the case was rescheduled multiple times and then dismissed.  My guest will probably die while still with me, but many like him abound, and there aren't a lot of solutions.  I\u2019ve looked.  It\u2019s distressing how mental illness among us remain unaddressed.  In Wash. DC we await the trial of the mansion murderer, an ex-employee who brutally murdered four people.  In Newtown, Adam\u2019s mother needed help too and never found it, nor did Adam.  I don\u2019t know if the Las Vegas shooter could have been aided, but something in addition to gun control is needed.  Vehicles, airplane, bombs  are used for atrocities.  In NYC a rat tail hair comb is outlawed.  Has violence there ceased?  Yes, tighten and enforced gun laws, but let's also look at ways of getting to the heart of the matter, and try to reach and render aid to potentially rage filled and/or the mentally ill including homeless shelter residents, fired employees, disciplined students, DV perps, animal abusers).\nIntervene before people \"go postal.\"  Could checking people\u2019s emotional pulse tie in with being licensed to drive?  Could police flag aggressive drivers for \u201cconsultations.\"  Sometimes a calming chat with a mental health prof. could be sobering and helpful, recalling Blanche in Streetcar who \"[] always depended on the kindness of strangers.\"  , 6 In this \"new\" America, where billionaires own everything and hopelessness is rampant due to the lack of meaningful employment for the vast majority of Americans (except for the most economically and biologically privileged), we need new rituals for manhood.  Yes, many of these violent actors are struggling with deep mental health issues.  However, we must also acknowledge that many men (especially young men) have an innate tendency to turn their rage at seemingly unmanageable life circumstances either outward (in acts of violence against others) or inward (in acts of suicidal violence and/or addictive behavior).  Elites cannot expect these issues to go away by shaming or blaming or by not dealing with the dire state of the American economy (or simply by making it easier for billionaires to hoard money).   And then, simultaneously, there is always the lecturing with Randian arrogance from afar that \"this is freedom, this is capitalism at its Hayekian finest,\" and \"we are saving you from socialism/communism/terrorism.\"  No.  This is not going to work anymore.  The violence will continue from random actors at random times until a different type of society is created, one that offers more meaning beyond working three service sector jobs, hoping to make it big on \"Shark Tank\" and being told that everyone is going to become a computer programmer.    , 6 Offering prayers after these mass slaughters is both pointless and condescending. Relying on faith to make things better is an insult to those who've had their blood and brains splashed across the earth. Faith discounts evidence and is blind to proof. Every prayer in the absence of action based upon the clear evidential link between gun ownership and annual gun slaughter is a death sentence for thousands more innocent people. , 6 Civilians can't own machine guns so why are these guns still legal?, 6 Trump has take credit for there being no airplane crashes during his presidency. Does he take credit for 18 mass shootings in 2018 alone? He should. His base, and the GOP are completely in the pockets of the NRA. They OWN this horror.\nNothing changed after little children were slaughtered, nothing changed after families in church were slaughtered, nothing changed after the carnage in Los Vegas. Nothing will change now. Sad. Really, really sad, and disgusting and unconscionable, and absolutely predictable from the GOP.\nThoughts and prayers. OK then., 6 To everyone who bemoans yet again the failure to control gun violence at the Federal level, start using the 10th Amendment instead of  worrying about the 2nd.  States which want to outlaw assault weapons and require controls on purchases of guns and ammunition should pass more laws and and bring every kind of legal action to the Federal courts to be able to do so.  If other states want to allow everyone to have guns in schools, universities, churches, whatever, let them.  Most of these states voted for Trump, and I am tired of worrying about them.  Let them kill each other., 6 All those predictive clues; all those signs which classmates saw as leading to the inevitable; all of the audacious social media braggadocio.  And yet our country has not a clue how to address this.  We have been brainwashed, not by the Russians, but by the gun lobby.\n\nWhat else could possibly explain the confusion so many of us feel about why congress is so tone deaf regarding curbing of easy access to guns,  The easy answer: strict regulation of bullets..., 6 Guns are at the core of a culture of violence in the US.  In movies, on TV, in political campaigns, in games guns overwhelm the senses, rumors of guns, displays of guns, are everywhere.  Fear stoked by the NRA, GOP and media of \"others\" have seeped into the consciousness of a population that now too quickly demands violence as THE solution to our problems.  Guns, too readily accessible, brings our culture of violence home to roost., 6 Most of our concern over this, aside from the impossible effort to commiserate with the families, is to ask \"WHY\".  Too many guns, uncaring legislators, not enough guns; the list goes on and on.\n\nBut like most questions in the United States in the current atmosphere, the answer is \"MONEY\".  Not just the money made selling guns (and that is almost incomprehensibly high), but also the money for Congress to run for office.  If Members of Congress take a stand for ANY gun control efforts, even those favored by 90+ percent of all Americans, they will lose campaign MONEY.  And that MONEY will go to a more extreme primary opponent, and they will lose their seat.  Not to the opposition, but to their own party. And to them, THAT is the worst tragedy they can imagine.\n\nA personal note- I was asked by a friend, after the Las Vegas shooting, if that shooter used the same kind of weapon I used in South Viet Nam in 1969.  I was a door-gunner and used an M-60 machine gun.  This friend was horrified by the carnage, is a huge gun supporter, and rock-solid NRA man.  I told him no, the shooter there used assault-style rifles and if he had a machine gun it would have been hundreds of times worse. But to cheer him up, I also told him that at some point these murderers will probably be able to get machine guns, silencers, and God knows what other advanced military weapons coming on the market. He did not seem cheered-up by this news, but loves his Congressman.  \n\nHmm..., 6 No money for mental health professionals in the schools, but the city has a tank.  , 6 here, as in most such cases,  it was widely predicted, that this kid could be the one to shoot up the school. School admin took steps to defend the school from him, but those were inadequate. What's the point in teaching kids and staff to spot potentially dangerous persons if nothing effective is done to prevent tragedy? I'm sure there is a way to do an assessment on someone that the administration, or simply the \"crowd wisdom\" of students at the school says may become a killer; checking social media, parents, et al, checking off the warning signs. When they have a preponderance of warning signs without sufficient counterbalancing healthy indicators and traits, then they are issued a \"no firearms\" ticket. Firearms are removed from the home; he may not buy a firearm and is on the \"no buy\" list that firearms dealers access before selling a firearm. Every five years he can get a review, and there would be a way for him to request a review on an ad hoc basis for good reason. Just like a felon, if found with a firearm, he'd be arrested. What about his second amendment rights, if he's never been convicted of a felony? My answer is: Who gives a flying fig? These are our kids being slaughtered like rabbits. Let the NRA and its stooges in Congress figure out how they can get themselves out of the way. And if they don't, then God help 'em, because the parents of America surely won't. , 6 Our leaders in government hyperventilate about the nuclear threat posed by a blustering North Korea, yet barely bat an eyelid at the recurrent carnage we Americans inflict upon ourselves. It\u2019s convenient to focus on an external enemy as being the problem and demand the other change, rather than do the hard work of reforming ourselves first., 6 Last night, my wife informed me that there had been another mass shooting. This time in Florida.\nIn the past, I would be horrified when learning of these events. Now, not so.\nIt is still horrible but I only have so much emotion to contribute. \n\nWe know that the NRA is behind every one of these shootings. We know that they are simply a lobby for gun manufacturers. We know they pay congressmen to turn a blind eye to gun violence and issue pablum in response. We know that there will be calls for prayer and a call to arms by the right simultaneously. There is never any need to read the article. Most often it is simply another disaffected, angry white male with a score to settle who had easy access to the mass-killing weapon of his choice, courtesy of the NRA. \n\nWe know how to solve this? Ban semi-automatics of all kinds. It is the thing that will make America a safer place. But the gun lobby will work feverishly through the nights and days following to ensure that this goes the way of all other attempts to remedy the scourge of semi-automatic weaponry on the streets. They will ply their congressmen with money, fill their pockets with cash, and have them look the other way., 6 Reality intrudes on politics when people are dieing. Some are thankful that the news isn't about Trump, but about assault rifles, which of course, we can't talk about because it is too soon after a tragedy.\n\nWe Americans are perfect in political predictability, but not much else.\n\nI'm tempted to do a data analysis of the use, of assault weapons in our most recent mass killing tragedies, but it would be useless. Just like involvement of Islam, but we must restrict immigration of people from Islamic because they might kill us. Suicidalism among Islamic believers is overrated. Our own Christian society is very effective in this regard, at least with respect to our young people. And those are the people most likely to go on a suicidal mission. And those are the people with the most to lose., 6 In seeing this horrible tragedy I reflect on all the other horrific mass shootings and I realize that we cannot blame the shooters. Any person that decides to shoot a group of students, teachers, or any other innocent bystander is clearly mentally unstable. The fact that in the United States, mentally unstable persons are able to get a hold of fire arms over and over again shows that the United States is clearly broken. I\u2019m sure there are a million loop holes for mentally ill persons to acquire fire arms which leads me to strongly believe that in order for us to be safe, no civilian should be able to purchase fire arms on the open market. , 6 It happens again and again and again and again. It is difficult to keep mourning. But I am so angry right now. Angry at our spineless politicians, the hypocritical culture that claims to \u201cchoose life\u201d but in the end, always chooses guns. Repeal the second amendment. We have shown too many times our collective inability to interpret it logically., 6 Another tragedy caused by gun violence. By now the aftermath is predictable: national handwringing for a few days, NRA-propaganda to tamp it down, followed by Congressional inaction, making another slaughter of innocents inevitable. Here's a thought: If parents of dead innocent victims would allow, make the crime scene photos public and dare these craven Congress people to act. Maybe seeing the brutal gore of gun violence will shock our nation into action once and for all. Enough with \"thoughts and prayers.\" They never stopped a bullet and never will. , 6 We have accepted the NRA definition of the Second Amendment.  There is no logical reason that \"arms\" should include assault rifles.  Why not hand grenades? Or missiles?  Let's rein in the Second Amendment, in favor of the right to peaceably assemble!  , 6 I have been sober as a result of 12-Step recovery for almost 7 years - in fact, as of writing this comment, I'm clean 6 years and 10 months.\n\nI'll never forget what someone in a meeting shared once. He said, \"I can only change at the speed of pain. And unfortunately, as an addict and alcoholic, I have a very high threshold for pain.\" This clearly is the case with our mass shootings.\n\nWe are addicted to guns, and we have not reached our \"bottom\" yet. It still doesn't hurt enough - after 20 dead elementary school children in Newtown CT, 49 dead gay nightclub goers in Orlando, and 58 dead music festival fans in Las Vegas - just to name a few shootings.\n\nThis is frightening. It is enraging. It is discouraging. Worst of all, it coarsens my heart. \n\nWhich brings me to my next applicable spiritual axiom: \"Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.\" Suffer means \"to become worse because of being badly affected by something; to allow especially by reason of indifference\".\n\nWe are indifferent. And the only way out, paradoxically, is for more hurt. Brace yourselves., 6 No citizen needs access to a weapon that can do this. , 6 We are simplyfing the problem. Yes the problem is guns but Americans are pulling those triggers. We have to find out why. We have to have the courage to ask why Americans are killing Americans at record numbers. What is wrong with our culture and society, because the problem is getting worse almost exponentially everyday. And this will get much worse , and it\u2019s only a symptom of a much larger disease, till we fight the disease rather then the symptoms we have no chance of solving the problem.\n   We need universal health care that includes mental health care, that\u2019s a good start. If we can some how afford billions for guns and bombs for our military, can\u2019t we afford it for the physical and mental health of our citizens.\n  From this point, every idea and solution to this epidemic should be on the table...so far, I see absolutely nothing being done..., 6 As a non-American I have to say I admire the passion of the US citizens to defend their 'freedom' even at the cost of their children's lives. Of course, coming from a country where guns are non-existent in the population (not even the police are allowed to carry them most of the time), I have to admit I am unable to grasp that 'sweet, sweet smell of freedom' in the air that every American parent must feel every day when they send their young offspring to a supposed safe place of learning.\n\nThat 'freedom air' would be overwhelming to me and most of my fellow Britons which is why I will definitely avoid ever moving or even visiting the US in the near (or distant) future. Unfortunately, I will have to continue spending my life under the 'socialist yoke' of universal free healthcare and extremely strict gun laws.\n\nOh, the humanity!!!, 6 From news reports, there was a police officer stationed at the school. A 'good guy with a gun' as the NRA calls it. Did that make the carnage stop sooner? No! When will we wake up and take on the NRA and their very small amount of members and bring sanity back to gun laws?\nThese unfortunate people who did nothing but go about their normal business are gone because Congress has no backbone., 6 instead of spending 25 billion dollars on a wall why dont we spend it on school safety. , 6 In this respect DT was successful to to fulfill his slogan of MAGA.\nThe US is number one in mass shootings in the word! \n\nWe lag behind the rest in education , longevity, health care and happiness.\nThank you for voting!, 6 Aftermath:\nInnocent are dead. \"Officials\" call for schools to do more. Let's see, the school expelled student. Attorney for custodial family of shooter says \"No signs noticed\". Why not start there. It sounds good to get in front of matters to protect innocent family members, but that statement is blatantly false by the facts stated. So, is this parental neglect? THEY DIDN'T SEE A PROBLEM after student is expelled...after reviewing social media posts? Calling attorney statement out!  Sure, some gun control may have helped, but the acts are the acts! How it was accomplished should not negate responsibility!\nSo, let's see...student rights and privacy, vs. Public good and welfare. One in custody, 17 dead! I call you out!\nHow about this:\nLaw requiring parents to attend school conferences when called upon. Backup to that law, littany of consequences for any failure to do so. In addition, in appropriate disciplinary matters, require inspection of Social Media activity, mental health evaluation of student, and generally require those in parental control take responsibility for actions of student. I call \"Officials\" out!\nThis is no time for politics, but it is a time for reasonable, responsible legislative action to help schools do their job of educating...EDUCATING!!!\nOutcome: less restriction of the innocent, and responsible; more accountability for those who have parental rights. Maybe then we'd get more of a push to get increased mental health funding., 6 The outrage and sadness we all feel is all too apparent in the flurry of comments we post after these unthinkable events.\n\nWe are numb, we are frozen in shock and what to scream out \u201cenough!\u201d\n\nHowever, the hollow debate continues whether more guns prevent these from happening.  But it\u2019s really only a debate for the side that wants to keep selling guns, to delay for eternity any meaningful action or legislation.\n\nRepublicans need to address these tragedies. Democrats have to fix everything else, even to their political detriment, can Republicans propose a solution or meaningful action? Democrats could and have., 6 people here are comparing fast cars and negligent drivers with guns and gun owners.Cars are meant to transport and agree accident happens . Guns are meant to KILL . , 6 AS terrible as this sounds, we all now bear the burden for non-action after these monstrous crimes. The cowards in Congress do nothing but pretend to be outraged.\nI believe the only solution is a continuous public outpouring of opposition to the gun lobby and demonstrations at our centers of government on a par with the civil rights movement...and I don't mean to suggest only protesting the kinds of  mass carnage we have just witnessed in Florida, but also to the daily killings that don't get sensational press coverage.\nLet us march on Washington.  Let us march on our state capitals...Let us change the constitution, before we're afraid to leave our homes forever.\nDo you really believe our founding fathers intended for us to possess any and all weapons when they wrote the 2nd amendment?  That was just a practical means of protecting our young country against foreign invasion at a time when our national military strength was weak. And even if you're delusional enough to believe that they did, they lived during a time so different from our own, that many of the laws and rights included in our constitution have almost  become archaic, with almost no relevance to modern American life.\nHowever,  they did have the wisdom to foresee this eventuality, and the need to amend the constitution when necessary.... It's necessary now.\nWe amended the 18th amendment with the 21st.\nWe now need a 28th amendment to amend the 2nd.\nHow many more of our children must die before we act?, 6 It's the guns. And it's the NRA.\nWith 270 million firearms in circulation the NRA pretends there aren't enough and we still need more. And since guns don't wear out like cars or clothing, that's how you know it's all about the commerce, nothing to do with anything else. It will never be enough for the NRA.\n40% of American households have guns. The other 60% don't see the need. Last time I checked 60% represents a clear majority. This country is off track. , 6 1) Offer a few thousand dollars to buy back full auto weapons while simultaneously making all full auto weapons and conversion components illegal to sell.  Upholding our institutions is what will save the day, not guns.\n2) Instead of thoughts and prayers and giving the killer validation by nonstop coverage, face the camera and talk to future potential killers using the media and tell them not to do it and that there is someone out there who loves them.  That no problem is worth killing another. Its called a campaign and they can be powerful.  Unhappy angry people watch TV. And there are a lot of unhappy people in the U.S. and a lot of weapons.  Wouldnt it be great to be the first media outlet to start doing that?  , 6 Each time one of our GOP congressmen or women gives a speech of how sad these shootings are, or how they will pray for the victims , ask them this. \"How much did the NRA CONTRIBUTE TO YOU ? When they say \"no words can describe. . . \" say we have the words, when the say \" there is nothing we can do\" say there is \"gun control.\" You will have to be brave, you will have to be strong, you will have to do the right thing. Just do it. Stop working for the NRA, you work for us.  Your children aren't dying, ours are. The people who might have voted for you, people whose children go to public schools. Again the less fortunate of this country will and are paying the price. , 6 Talking about it is worthless.  Prayers are worthless.  Empty platitudes are worthless.  I heard someone on TV today say \"we'll get over this\".  No, the parents and families will NEVER get over it.  \n\nCall up your Representatives and Senators and tell them if they don't pass sensible gun legislation, they don't have your vote or your money and that you'll work in the next election to see that they won't get re-elected.   That's the only thing that has even the slightest chance of working.\n\nNo civilian should have an assault weapon.  End of story.   Nowhere in the Constitution does it say they should.  , 6 Hello failed school counselors.  So many dropped the ball if so many students knew he was so 'troubled' or weird or else a mess to be dealt with.  The school failed its students and its principal and counselors should be dismissed... period.  Any school where this happens should have repercussions.  Only then will they step up and be watchful, as is their job.  They love their long vacations and winter holidays without responsibilities.  Do your job.  If the students knew, why not the counselors?, 6 As someone said after the last mass shooting, \"Thoughts & prayers, mourn, repeat\".  Just another day in America.  I refuse to accept the idea that mass shootings are part of the price we pay for freedom.  Totally sick and disgusted how this continues and NOTHING is done.  I lost a lot of faith in humanity after Sandy Hook, and yet the horror continues., 6 Most commenters here are palpably ignorant when it comes to firearms. First of all, the vast majority of gun-related deaths (including suicides) involve handguns. So if you wish to \"save lives\" and bring our rate of gun-related deaths in line with \"other nations\", shouldn't you be focusing on handguns? Rifles of any kind are rarely used in violent crimes. Secondly, in terms of capability, there is absolutely nothing special about the AR-15. It is functionally no different from a large number of other modern rifles that are not considered \"assault weapons\" and are available for sale even in NYC. The only reason the AR15 appears to be more widely used than other rifles by mass shooters is because it happens to be, by far, the most popular rifle in the U.S. By the same logic, Hondas are involved in a lot more accidents than Porsches. Does that mean that a Honda are somehow less safe than a Porsche? Of course not, it just happens that Honda is more widely owned. Thirdly, the Assault Weapons Ban was found to have had zero effect on violent crime of any sort (including mass shootings) in the 10 years it was in force. How would a new one accomplish what the old one could not? Some of the worst mass shootings in history took place while the ban was in effect. Firearms have always been an integral part of our culture and have always been available, yet mass shootings like this one is a relatively recent phenomenon. Shouldn't we investigate why that is, instead of focusing on the tool?, 6 I am a deputy sheriff in Michigan. Why is no one talking about the school administration and the fact that they knew he was a danger and did nothing about it? They expelled him but never mentioned anything to law enforcement about his death threats to classmates using a firearm. This could have been avoided if they simply would have notified law enforcement about the threats and took one glance at his social media page. Yes the AR-15 is powerful weapon in the wrong hands but banning all firearms to civilians is not the answer. Michigan's violent crimes have decreased 40% since the state allowed trained and lawful citizens to carry concealed firearms so there is a direct correlation. Every mass shooting has been carried out in gun-free zones which the bad guys know will not have any trained, armed, and lawful citizens. Bad guys don't follow the laws we have in place so making certain firearms illegal is pointless since they will,find a way to get them. If you want to stop so many guns getting into the hands of criminals then talk to your state reps about banning the gun show loophole which Michigan did a few years ago. This is where many of the recent mass shooters have obtained the firearms they use in these horrific events. i am saddened to see yet another school shooting since I have two young children in school. I personally feel this horrible event could have been prevented if someone would have just stood up and notified law enforcement of this troubled young man. , 6 When I read the comments - especially Catherine's - I feel change can only begin when we have more women leading the country. I am looking forward to helping make that change - deeply, sincerely, bravely, into a better, more human, future., 6 My son was in graduate school at the time of the Virginia Tech shootings. His Forensic Science professor was in law enforcement and took the opportunity to train the classroom about what to do should an active shooter enter the classroom. I remember thinking at the time that this was excessive. Eleven years later I believe this training should be mandatory. There have been 18 school shootings in the first 45 days of 2018! \u201cPrayers and condolences\u201d from a President who accepted $31 million from the NRA just doesn\u2019t cut it.  Charleton Heston has been dead for 10 years. It\u2019s time to pry that gun from his cold, dead hands and the hands of the NRA members. , 6 Missing from the story: Who sold this guy military weapons and ammo?\n How much profit did the arms industry make off of 17 more deaths and who knows how many more injuries? , 6 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS--SOME COMMENTS/THOUGHTS\nI remember the first time I heard about a school shooting. I was working as a deck-hand on a school-ship, the Texas Clipper, sailing from Galveston to Dublin. It was August 1, 1966 and we were in the middle of the Atlantic ocean rolling along at 12 knots. The captain and crew told us about what happened, it was HUGE news, even there and then.\nWe've had a number of school shootings since then. In all likelihood we will continue to have them. What's going to happen? Well, back in 1966 there were no controls for boarding airliners so people also brought guns on board those, too. And back then there were regularly-occurring hijackings like to Cuba. Solution? Controls. Metal detectors at airports. The number of hijackings fell precipitously.\nWhat we are going to see are more and more controls in the USA, such as to enter schools (already), malls, theaters, museums, and the like. I'm sure President Trump is against gun control, well except maybe for properties/places he's visiting. (Even now, whenever I fly a small plane--I'm a pilot--I first must check that he's not near where I plan to go, because that's restricted.)\nSo, we'll continue to play this wonderful game. The people like those in the National Rifle Association and others will continue to say they're fighting--and having success--against gun control. But, really, we're getting more and more de facto gun control all the time. It's inevitable, and actually a great idea.\n\nNow what I'm curious to see is what will the US Senate do about the bill the House already passed that would allow those people who have a conceal-carry permit in their state to have that right (privilege) in any other state. Even the conservative-leaning NY Post has come out AGAINST that. And isn't it ironic, Republicans who normally tout states' rights seem to be holding their collective noses on this one. , 6 Is it too early to talk about patriarchy?  Isn't this just an extreme example of males feeling that things have to go their way or they are going to get revenge?  To have so many males raised this way and having it shored up in movies and TV shows and then letting them arm themselves with such deadly weapons, presumably for \"hunting,\" is creating a reign of terror.  That's the extreme but the wife-beating, as we have seen this past week, is on the same spectrum.   Let's start dealing with the root causes of this problem -- male privilege and a power imbalance.   , 6 The 2018 Midterm elections are the single most important election in modern US History.  While we can certainly debate whether Democrats are progressive enough on certain issues, the Republicans are destroying every norm and institution this country was founded upon. PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS COUNTRY - VOTE. , 6 We can\u2019t stop humans from committing horrifying crimes but we can make it harder.\nGuns, especially semi-automic ones like the type used here, make it easy to commit horrific crimes. That\u2019s why most developed countries (like the one I\u2019m living in) make it extremely difficult to get hold of guns.\nIt is absolutely beyond my comprehension why the US insists on making it easy for anyone to get guns while imposing strict prohibition on drugs and other potentially harmful things., 6  There are limits to every Constitutional Amendment.\n1st Amendment:\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nSo, why is the 2nd Amendment so special that it should be read in the broadest (and also contested) ways possible, and yet have the unique status as to \"not be limited\"?\n\nLosing another child or adult to guns is an outrage in the 21st century, whether you are in the US or in Syria., 6 Some people say use armed guards. Or metal detectors. And once a while some armed guard might have his own pyschological issues... You not only need less guns but also a healthier society. This is very complex. As a first step companies should pay sick days, overtime hours and care more about their employes. Then there should be medical insurance for everyone so that everyone goes to see a doctor if he/she is ill. Also the culture must change, less promoting of war games and less praising the military. Yes it is gun control but not only gun control!, 6 I've been through multiple lockdowns the the elementary schools where I've taught, for active shooters and SWAT activity in the neighborhood. I've even had the pleasure of getting locked down in my children's daycare at dismissal, because right at that time, some armed but decided to get in a car chase with police in our neighborhood. Like any good school, they had a lockdown procedure in place and practice it regularly with children ages 6 weeks to 5 years. Because yes, for those of you who have grown children or no children, lockdowns have been a thing at schools and child care centers since Columbine or so. (That was about 20 years ago.)\n\nEvery couple of days I run through What I Would Do If scenarios in my mind at work, usually prompted by any mundane happenings - like when I have to stop an unfamiliar male visitor to my school in the hall at work. What if he was a nut with a gun? Where would I hide the kids? How much time would it take to get them all out the window? Would a shooter hear me if I called 911? Or even better, when I'm at work, my mom paranoia about daycare: what if my babies get put on lockdown again? What if bullets hit the daycare and my son's crib is too close to the window? Fun fact: Sandy Hook happened while I took a personal day to interview for a job at a private school. I almost asked if a bulletproof vest was included at the interview. \n\nAmerica, 2018. Greatest country on earth., 6 Well, only 17.  Somebody will try to do better than that, won't they?  American carnage.  There are guns like that in a store not far from here.  I asked once about those semi-automatics rifles in there and heard the rationales; deer hunting, home protection, oh, and how much the guy's son enjoyed shooting the things.  The big banana clips--no doubt the kid wouldn't have to stop to reload.\n\nThe second amendment with a couple words or commas would preclude private citizens from owning such things.  I'm waiting to hear how this 19-year old person came by such weapons; how he managed to slip through the vetting process.  He'd been expelled from a public school.  was that not enough to keep killing things out of his hands?  What about the person at Sandy Hook or the those at Columbine?  \n\nWe're going to hear the same old, same old.  It's not the guns, it's the killers.  Don't forget the one about, the more guns, the safer we are from bad people.  We've become calloused to these events; We'll forget about this one in a bit., 6 It doesn't matter, does it?  It will happen again.  And again.\n\nOnce Newtown was set aside, we all knew nothing would ever change.\n\nI am sick with sadness and anger.\n\nWe really live side by side live in two countries.  One where Newtown brought our President to tears.  And another country where Newtown was unfortunate, but more worryingly, a danger to gun ownership for a fleeting moment.  A moment passed., 6 I find it incomprehensible that a nation where there is so much gun violence does not ban firearms when there is no conceivable reason to have them, other than to satisfy a desire to do so and perceived entitlement, even when such ownership is so clearly contrary to the public interest., 6 And we are right back to \"prayers and condolences\".  For how long? What is it going to take for us to take ACTION? What if it was YOUR child, or your child's school? Safety drills hiding under desks are about as effective as the drills we did in the 50s when there was a threat of nuclear attacks. The danger now could be any child (or adult) in any school, mall, movie, entertainment venue, street. One thing for sure, it isn't immigrants., 6 When the 2nd Amendment was written, a gun could shoot approximately 1 bullet every 30 seconds to 1 minute or more depending on how fast the gunholder could hold it. Would the 2nd Amendment be written in the same way if guns could be shot as fast and as deadly as they could be today? I highly doubt it. No one is asking to get rid of guns. The national conversation and, in large part, the NRA has skewed the conversation to an all or nothing debate. But it's not. Guns can be regulated so as to prevent tragedies like this from happening. Guns need to be regulated, but somehow, when tragedies like this, proponents of regulation-free gun registration turn quiet. , 6 This is about who to blame. I feel the criminal should take responsibility for his actions not the tool used. Everyone seems to want to blame the gun when it is powerless to do anything without someone grabbing it and committing a crime with it. Killing is already illegal, background checks are already part of the law required to get a gun. Over half of all school shootings were committed with a hand gun not an assault rifle. Any gun can be used by a criminal to kill people but any gun can be used by a law abiding citizen to defend them self or their family. Cars are now being used in attacks to kill multiple people. Yet I doubt we will ever hear a call for a ban on cars. More people are killed by drunk drivers than mass shootings yet most states don\u2019t even consider driving drunk a felony. New Jersey doesn\u2019t even consider driving drunk a misdemeanor! If we were serious about making laws to protect people how about we tackle drunk driving laws? What we really have is a society where our cultural values have dropped. Each generation has less respect for their elders, less respect for their government and laws. Less personal responsibility for their own actions. It isn\u2019t more laws that will fix this. It\u2019s better enforcement of the laws we have. Figure out a better way to identify these people that are creating the red flags before they commit a crime. Talk to their parents, set up counseling. Taking away rights from law abiding citizens though is not the answer. , 6 Whenever this happens, I find myself wondering if the USA has a right to call itself a functioning nation-state. When our public places are not safe, when our government cannot meet the needs of the people, or govern with the consent of a majority, what kind of nation-state are we?, 6 Unless the gun laws are revisited, we would only witness such incidents, praying for the departed souls to rest in peace; and the wounded to recover fast. It is time for some strong decision making., 6 Regulate guns like autos: Require licenses to show ability to use them responsibly, label each with identification numbers (in case stolen or used in crimes), renew state registration annually, pay taxes for ammunition and require they be insured to provide costs for the consequences of their use (added security required, like paying for roads with gas tax). Then, those wanting to use them would have to pay the costs.    , 6 I'm surpried these still make the front page, given that in America today, it has become a 'dog bites man\" story. Many people are tuned out for one of two reasons - either because they love guns too much, or on the other side, because it is the only way to preserve sanity given the resistance to action and inevitability of yet another in the near future (i fall in the second, coping mechanism group). But for the survivor and the family/friends of those directly affected, it is all very real and unavoidable., 6 Our kids do \u201cactive shooter\u201d drills. Kids in high schools outside the US learn multiple languages, study calculus not third grade arithmetic, and learn about contentious topics like evolution. If I had children, I definitely wouldn\u2019t be raising them in the US. , 6 Why isn\u2019t law enforcement speaking out strongly for gun control? How do they benefit when they don\u2019t have a monopoly on violence, when the citizenry is able to be better armed than they are? How can they be expected to do their job? , 6 We have the right to protect ourselves;\n\nAnd if this justifies gun possession, how is  it helping to protect our children?, 6 After each horrendous episode, we collectively shout 'enough is enough', but as usual, nothing gets done, and once our gov't officials offers condolences for the victims, they return to their typical state of complacency and the issue is soon forgotten. Our children remain unprotected in our schools, campuses and classrooms which have evolved into killing fields, targets for any shooter holding a grudge against society in general. The weapon of choice is the assault rifle that serves no purpose other than to kill, and take as many lives as possible.  It's time to hold the manufacturers of these types of weapons accountable and demand and pass laws to prohibit the sale to the general public. Our children's lives vs. upholding the 2nd Amendment...which one will we choose?, 6 These events are firmly established as part of the American culture as much as Valentine's Day or any other tradition. Amendments can be repealed. This event won't break that camel's back but in time something will happen that will. Now may not be the time but one day it will be. , 6 It's easy to scream for chance in the emotion of it all, but we need to look at facts ,  data, and be rational about it. Gun violence is overall down in America  despite  record high gun ownership. \n\nThere's compromises  to be had. No we don't need to ban guns because most people with guns are not doing anything wrong.\n\nAnd no, we shouldn't ignore it and do nothing. We need to assess the true who why and how of these incidents and directly address those specifically., 6 Stop  blaming Congress and  Donald Trump.  These people were elected and many of them were re-elected.\n\nI understand we cannot be single-issue voters and that a person may agree with a conservative candidate's stances on other issues, disagree on guns and vote for the candidate anyway.\n\nBut let's be clear: that voter cannot absolve him or herself of the responsibility for acts like this.  The proliferation of guns in the US makes this easy, other countries simply don't have it.  It's not human nature, it's not insanity, it's the easy access to weapons.\n\nIf you continue to support candidates who refuse to see this, these massacres are on you. You are making a deal, taking tax cuts (or military spending or 'pro-religion' laws) in return for an occasional slaughter. \n\nBe a grown up and be accountable. Then vote against candidates who opposed reasonable gun laws.  If you support them, you support the context in which these massacres occur.\n\nSorry if it makes you feel bad. But you know it's true., 6 Such a tragedy that could have been prevented had armed guards been posted throughout the school. Although these are random events, I believe the firepower needs to be in place before the gunmen strike. In fact, all so-called soft targets need such protection. Thank you., 6 Let me point out.  The Republican party has full control of legislative power in Florida.  Currently the Republican party has full control of legislative power in the US controlling the House, Senate and the Presidency.\n\nIf the Republican party cannot use their power to put into place their plan--whatever it contains--to stop mass murder in schools, shopping malls or churches, it should be voted out and their jobs given to a political party with a plan to stop the killing.\n\nIf the Republican party wants to ban video games, install tracking devices on every child expelled from school, arm every student and teacher, spend millions on testing and treating the mentally ill in the US to stop mass murders with guns rather than limiting the number and type of guns sold and who is able to purchase a gun, then I say let them do it.  Give them the rest of Trump's term to put their plan into action and see what results they get. Let the voters decide in 2020 how the Republicans handled the mass murder crisis in the US.\n\nIf guns that can murder and injure over 25 people in seconds aren't the problem, let the Republicans take charge of this emergency and enact immediately the laws that will stop the killing in our schools, our churches, our homes and our malls.  Or let them resign and give those who have a plan a chance to save lives.\n\nNo more \"Thoughts and prayers\".  Act now., 6 I'd like to see stats on how many of the shooters of the past 20 years were raised in single-mom homes, as this one was.  That seems to be a common thread.  , 6 I'm going to be odd man out here.  But this is a failure of society in general that turned into an unimaginable tragedy.   I am not saying I have the answers because I don't.   The young man who committed this horrendous act had a history of behavior problems and had been kicked out of school.  What laws, privacy concerns, etc prevented us from intervening on his behalf before he came to this??   It's easy to blame the parents in these types of situations but we all need to sit back and think about what causes a troubled adoloscent, what can be done to assist that person?   Maybe we do need to allow for someone to be institunionized against their will (yes that has problems too).  Although he hadn't committed a \"crime\" yet people thought he could.   That is a double edged sword - how do we teach our children to not automatically judge and be unkind to someone vs how do we teach our children to stay away from someone they know has issues.   He was of legal age to buy a gun, ammunition, etc.  We raised the age of alcohol to 21 and in most states the age of tobacco  -- shouldn't we consider the same age constraints for guns and ammo?  Thowing stuff out there because thoughts, prayers and now isn't the time to talk about the \"gun\" issue doesn't work for me anymore. , 6 The clinging the constitutional right to bear arms  ( in a manner which I am sure your founding fathers never envisaged) and its interpretation that individuals may carry guns at all times even when there is no occupational requirement to do so,  means that all citizens of the United States bear responsibility for this shooting.  All citizens s are guilty.  If you wanted to change the constitution or its interpretation, you could. . , 6 How many times does this have to happen before some action in taken.  Even small steps, remember when bump stocks after the Las Vegas tragedy was a big deal no action has been taken.  Now another school shootings it will be interesting to see if the NRA is more important to our elected officials than our children.  It seems to have been the case for years.  Sorry statement on our society.  , 6 There is a reason why we have the highest death rate from weapons in the industrialized world. As usual, the NRA will tell us that the solution is to arm the adults that work at the school. For every one criminal shot by a civilian that is armed (very rare), there are over ten deaths by accidental shooting and over 100 deaths by intentional use of legal guns to murder a relative. Arming civilians is simply not the solution. Indeed, when the NRA looked for just one case where a semi automatic weapon had been used in self-defense at any time anywhere in the US, it found just one example, that it publicized.  But this later turned out to be a shotgun rather than a semi-automatic weapon. That, while thousands die. Insanity., 6 People like to throw around the word \u201cgun control\u201d in response to these types of tragedies, and it\u2019s understandable, but few practical solutions present themselves. How will you remove guns currently among the populace? Confiscate them? Who will carry that out? How will you ensure that people who intend to commit crimes (I.e. those most likely not to have acquired their weapon by legitimate means, or to surrender a weapon in their possession) do not have access to weapons? Crucially, at the end of the day, how will you have avoided taking guns from law abiding citizens, failing to take them from criminals, and merely helped put more money in the coffers of black market arms dealers who could now charge a higher premium for their product?\nSolutions fashioned from the steps other nations have taken on gun control are inapposite because they ignore a major distinguishing factor - the US\u2019s uniquely long history of broad access to firearms. Closing some of the loopholes on the purchasing side would certainly be helpful, but it\u2019s unlikely to be the panacea so many seem to hope for., 6 Where does the NRA get its funding?  Why are they so powerful?  How much of it comes from Russian nationals?  Why are they allowed to donate to presidential elections?  The NRA is a  mega funding source for republicans.  We should ask a lot more questions about their leaders, funding and agenda .  The NRA seems more like an organization that wants tp drive chaos in the US system so we have our own worries and are less effective in the rest of the world and based on the way the Trump administration is working - i would say they are succeeding. , 6 My heart goes out to the victims and survivors. One can only hope this latest tragedy triggers gun law reform., 6 After San Bernardino I remember reading an opinion somewhere that, sooner or later, statistically every American would be personally touched by gun violence.  While horrifying to digest, it gave me a small glimmer of hope that perhaps only when enough of us have been effected will we beging to see actual change.\n\nThat hope faded when, after Las Vegas, a victim who was shot but survived, and proclaimed himself to be an avid pro of the 2A, was interviewed from his hospital bed that \"this is the price we pay to be free\". That chilled me to the core. This is the mentality we are facing: that the pro-gun lobby and 2 Amendment \"enthusiasts\" think their right to own an assault weapon trumps my right to life, my child's right, friends, loved ones etc. To these people, owning a gun is worth more than life itself, and if innocent children die so they can amass weapons of mass destruction, then so be it. \n\nRecently a right wing commentator said that while other countries do not allow their citizens to amass weapons, those people are \"not as free as we are\".  All I know is this: this morning I woke up in a foreign country, I dropped my daughter off at school, assured that she will be home safe and sound this evening.  That's peace of mind. That's tranquility and confidence in my community and my government to keep us safe.  That's freedom., 6 Sadly it's still not an appropriate time to talk about mass shootings and gun control with only \"prayers and condolences\" offered by Congress and Trump.  \n\nThe NRA lobby will continue to pay millions so Congress does not discuss mass shootings and military style weapons on the House or Senate floor. \n\nPro-gun folks will continue to argue the minutia of \"semi automatic\" versus machine guns and absolutely defend the 2nd Amendment while refusing to develop any useful dialogue on how to reduce gun violence in America.\n\nMore guns does not make everyone safer when mass shootings are so common in America.  \n\nMy guess is the NRA and pro-gun crowd will might suggest we sending Johnny and Jane to school with a concealed weapon in their lunch box., 6 As a parent, I am in tears. As a European, I keep asking myself: Isn\u2018t this just another day in the US of A? As long as weapons are valued higher than human lives, these days will occur. Parents will be facing the end of the world. Schoolmates will be traumatized. Teachers will feel even more insecure. And politicians will tell everybody, how sad a day it is. And nothing, nothing will change for the better., 6 As an American living in Europe, I wonder whether a foreign tourist boycott of the USA could change the gun culture and the inability of our elected politicians to stop mass shootings.  What if people from other countries stopped visiting?  Maybe then we would be forced to see our country the way people from other countries see our country.  Maybe we need to ask our friends around the world to stop visiting the US and stop spending their money there. Would the death of the tourist industry in the US bring change?  , 6 Where is our moral compass? I beg our former presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter to band together and challenge our leaders to do the right thing. Stop the \"thoughts and prayers.\" We need a call to action. Imagine what action our former presidents could harness if they spoke with one voice. Our national heart is broken because of our legislators' inaction. Please lead us toward healing through pressuring our legislators to pass strong gun control measures. We must stop this., 6 When will this madness end? When our politicians find their backbones and their consciences, both of which are sadly missing. \n\nAnd I disagree with Andy: Our children are raised in an atmosphere of violence. We have become innured to  shootings, stabbings, bombings, etc. It's not just video games; it's the evening news, movies, etc. And the \"heroes\" are often not the kinds of people young people (or old) should be emulating. There may be a bit of good in some of it, but on the whole it is doing far more harm than good. , 6 AR-15s can be had for $500 at Cabelas. If these things are to remain legal, they should cost $5000 and up. \n\nBut nothing will be done until we break the grip that the NRA and GOP have on the discussion about guns. I am a gun owner, I support the Second Amendment, but currently our system is insane . , 6 Most of these are occurring in the south and west, where gun laws are, to put it mildly, lax.  This is the life southerners in particular choose. Per capita rates of gun deaths are significantly higher there. But they now wish to export their violence to the north, For in the form of concealed carry, including into my state, NY, and my city, New York, where we have stricter gun laws and are enjoying some of the lowest murder rates in modern times. I just have one thing to say to those people: stay where you are in the south; do not come into my state, and do not dare bring guns into my state and city. Stay the he'll away. We don't want you or your guns., 6 To the discussion of violent video games: so far no one has mentioned evidence of obsessive video game use by this shooter. They have however, mentioned that he was \"a loner\" who had difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships. This symptom is as wearying familiar as the bloodshed. If we citizens really want to act on the social isolation that allows violent, aberrant behaviors to grow like bacteria in the dark, then we have to stop hiding behind our many screens and return to what used to be civilized practices of society. You know, spend time with neighbors. Volunteer at neighborhood civic organizations. And yes, sigh, go to church and encourage others to do the same - for everybody's health. Clearly electronic connections do not sustain civilization at the same level as real ones. I hope those families of the victims are surrounded today by more friends and families then they ever knew existed, rather than a bunch of Facebook condolences., 6 Kids are the victims of these horrific acts and they need to rise up collectively and take action. Turn fear and anger into a chorus of voices demanding change. Young people of voting age need to act to and take control of their future, not allow the older generations that have created their present to continue down a path of carnage., 6 Horrific and especially hurting as the lives lost were just flowering. And , also the suffering of the living ones. One can only offer heartfelt condolences to those dear ones who feel immeasurable pain right now. The saddest thing is that the horrific event as such is not surprising today in the US, as every day, sane people around the country have this fear in the back of their mind and the hope that this wouldn't be the day one would hear another horror of mass shooting. Sadly , it's not such a day. Let us hope and pray this was the last one., 6 I suppose it is newsworthy to report these incidents but perhaps you just create a column for the latest shootings. Prolonged investigative journalism is pointless in these cases. The NRA guarantees the right to commit mass shootings. In Canada we have become inured to these events, it is considered part of the American culture, right up there with Disney and reality TV shows. , 6 I live in a country where high powered weapons can be purchased but only with very strict and thorough background checks and are used almost exclusively for hunting introduced animals like goats etc. We have no mass shootings and more importantly no equivalent of the politically toxic, morally bankrupt NRA. I suspect the U.S. will never get any sensible gun control until the NRA and the spineless politicians it controls are dealt with. The rest of the world watches and thinks to itself ' how can you let this go on and on ?' , 6 True: No Words!  It's action that's needed.  Action by parents, school officials, and the public in general, to petition their district and state Congress Reps to move on gun control.\nPrayers and good thoughts are good, I suppose, but do nothing to bring about  effective change.\nI can't even fathom the pain and shock the parent's of the children randomly gunned down are experiencing nor that of the gunman's family members.  \n\nMore than gun control is needed, family members as well as teachers, paying attention to 'the loners',  questioning the why's, school counselors digging deeper when a student exhibits disciplinary problems, rather than expelling: it could signal a cry for help.  \n\nWill this be just another school shooting to add to countless previous senseless massacres that already took young lives, and the only action taken remain the same: praying, laying flowers and teddy bears on the street to commemorate the fallen, until 'next time' or will we as a nation, individually and collectively, take some sort of action to end this insanity? , 6 I write this every time there is one of these mass shootings. They are as predictable as night and day because of something called statistical probability. Somewhere North of 5 million Americans with serious mental health problems have easy access to the roughly 350 million guns in circulation. Any competent statistician could construct a probability distribution. Thus they will continue until Republican politicians in fear of the gun lobby's power among their base decide to do something serious about the problem besides offering the ritual and hypocritical thoughts and prayers. Don't hold your breath., 6 In 1764, a headmaster and ten students were shot to death in Pennsylvania.  In 1853, a Louisville student shot his headmaster with a pistol. In 1866, a Times editorial called for barring pistols among school children. There was no NRA then.  Still, a few months later, the writer may have taken the A Train to PS 18 where a city schoolboy used a pistol to shoot a classmate. There were at least 10 more school shootings in the US in the 1800\u2019s. It is more than 150 years since the Times first decided that gun control was the answer. Make of that what you want. It appears to me that common wisdom consists of trying to bang a square peg into a round hole. I\u2019m rooting for a new and better idea so we can make some inroads over the next 150 years. I confess that I don\u2019t know what might work. But after 150 years, I know what doesn\u2019t. , 6 Something is very wrong with a society when children are killing children. You blame it on the perp's anti-social tendency and mental health. You blame it on he was being bullied himself. When when adults keep saying \"guns don't kill people\" nonsense and blame it on social media alone but do nothing else to make prevention - and not just intervention - the main goal, the adults are the accomplice.\n\nIn the old days, bullied teens learned martial arts or boxing to defend themselves. Now, they go online for guns and ammo. Or they kill themselves. \n\nThere is no decent education like be kind to each other. Instead, the best the adults can come up with is run-hide-fight. A bandage for a gushing wound to a major artery!, 6 The permissive gun culture has left no public or private space unaffected not even schools and the budding lives there always exposed to the gunshot fires. , 6 Relax folks, the NRA has this well under control., 6 Those students that we lost were born right before or after 9/11.   They have lived in a 21st century in which more wrong has been done than right.  They were in elementary school when they learned about Newtown.  They were just starting to go to concerts when they learned about Paris and Manchester and Las Vegas.  They were toddlers or kindergartners during Virginia Tech.  \n\nJust some ramblings to show that these are indeed very young individuals that we have lost yesterday.\n\nWe older folks grew up with the promise and excitement of the 21st century.  If we only knew., 6 Thoughts and prayers from us, and a great big influx of money for the weapons manufacturers (who sell only to Good Guys with Guns, of course), part of which will immediately be stuffed into politicians' pockets.\n\nAnd the beat goes on... and the  beat goes on..., 6 Nothing will change, and Wayne LaPierre will have his usual breakfast this morning., 6 If assault rifles were legitimately used for defense they would be called defense rifles. As it stands now they are aptly named, although they are more mass assault rifles these days. , 6 As a NYC elementary public school teacher for 25 yeas, I always imagined, especially after Columbine, September 11, and Sandy Hook, what I would do if an attacker entered my classroom and what I could do to save my students.  I imagined various scenarios, standing in front of my students so they would not be killed, grabbing the scissors from my desk and plunging them into the attacker's neck, getting my non-existent gun (illegal in NYC to own one) and shooting him. \n\n A few days after September 11, we had a drill where all 2,000 of our elementary school kids had to proceed to our cafeteria which is below ground.  They were silent, not a word, because they were frightened.  I was so angry that they had been traumatized by 9/11 and that they might not be totally safe at school as they should be, as every child should be.  \n\nI don't think there is any way that we can stop someone from entering a school and killing people other than having metal detectors at every school in this country.  Gun control will never be able to stop a person with the intent to kill from obtaining one.  No one should be legally allowed to purchase any kind of automatic weapon in any state in this country.  It's not needed for hunting (which I abhor) and it is not needed for any other reason than to kill many innocents. \n\nThis is an issue that Nancy Pelosi should be standing in the House for 8 hours, not the issue of illegal immigrants., 6 While your nations love of guns is baffling it seems that there is little progress to be made in changing laws on them. It does seem that you have a serious problem spotting and helping people with serious mental health issues. This doesn't seem surprising given your penchant for prioritizing individual rights over collective rights and the rather brutal justice system. Isn't this an area where your politicians could find some common ground?, 6 Thoughts and prayers don't cut it, people.\nMake a promise right now, and keep it.  Tell your legislators that you will not vote for any candidate who refuses to fully support sensible gun control legislation.  That is the only way to fix this.  , 6 How many more children? NOW is the time to take back our country from the NRA. Common sense laws have to be found to protect our children. , 6 I don't know how any American has the nerve to express shock and surprise at this latest mass shooting.  THIS LATEST MASS SHOOTING.  Americans were okay when the bodies of little children were carried out.  Americans watched the President wipe tears from his face.  Sandy Hook was the turning point in American history.  It told every terrorist that nobody has the courage to stop them.  We'll hear the same words.  The same experts will be consulted and interviewed.  The dead will be buried.  The news vans will leave.  And it will happen again., 6 I guess it is time we pay attention and take care of the angry, withdrawn, sad, troubled boys. I understand the frustration with the empty \"thoughts and prayers\" but the do-gooder liberal \"gun control\" chorus seems to be just as useless. I am 1000% in favor of gun control- any gun control we can get is a move in the right direction. However just cause you say it, doesn't make it so. While we have the worst possible scenario in this country of massive, easily accessible arsenals  and no (legislative) end in sight- can we maybe start to really check ourselves on how \"we\" treat the outcasts in our communities? The comment about all the good souls we lost- cherished babies turned triumphant celebrated teens is touching BUT we cannot afford to ignore the expelled, \"thrown-out\", angry, sad, disassociated children. I'm not talking about platitudes about mental health- but really getting that prevention will entail exiting our comfort zones of \"good kids\" vs. bad and undeserving. , 6 Tragic? Yes. Unpredictable? Definitely not!  As long as Americans persist with their obsession with guns, this kind of event will continue repeating itself, over and over again..., 6 Let's put the blame where it belongs, on Trump and every Republican in Congress who fail to do anything about this horrific blight of gun violence in the United States. All other First World nations, when confronted with a societal crisis such as mass shootings, have immediately attempted to do something about it. Not the U.S. of A. No, voters in the US have voted for politicos who even when they are shot themselves still remain blindly loyal to the Second Amendment and the NRA. These officials and the people who put them in office should be ashamed of themselves. Both are aiding and abetting this crimes against humanity. They have been so brainwashed, so beholden to the gun lobby, they are knowingly endangering the rest of our society. American Exceptionalism does not pertain to their propensity for violence more than other countries. American Exceptionalism is defined by the sheer stupidity of its citizenry who elect people who can but don't do anything about this solvable dilemma. Why are Americans so darned ignorant when it comes to gun control? Is being an American mean jettisoning all logic and reason? When one can do something and chooses not to what else must the rest of the world think. After all, look who they elected president. \n\nDD\nManhattan  , 6 With all the talk about keeping our country safe, and being the strongest country on the planet,why can't we keep our children safe ? The congress and the president, and the governor of Florida should be ashamed of allowing guns and assault weapons to be accessible to mass murderers. The corrupt politics of gun ownership needs to stop., 6 There is no reason, as far as I'm concerned, for an ordinary citizen to have a military weapon. Reading the comments, others share this opinion. Gun advocates are too quick to defend their right to bear arms. Have your right to bear arms; don't bear AR-15 rifles., 6 And this is the way it will be until the people who love the guns and have the guns and insist on the guns can connect the dots.  , 6 \u201cNo Words\u201d?\nHow about ENOUGH!\nEnough to the NRA and their deceitful mangling and mis-representation of the 2nd amendment to excuse use of AKR15 rifles that have no place in our country.\nEnough to the GOP that defends and blocks any reasonable approach to research and control of guns that have no or little place in our country.\nEnough to the NRA and GOP\u2019s collective hypocrisy.\nIt is becoming hard to feel sorry for victims of this type of preventable horror as Americans are not willing to stand up and say ENOUGH!, 6 Until we address this issue full on as a county and debilitate the NRA lobby, this carnage will continue under this administration of enablers who refuse to do anything or have the conversation., 6 The time has come to ban All guns and, most importantly, All bullets. This is includes shotguns and hunting rifles (Sorry Bernie, but the lily-white state of Vermont needs to agree). This has to be done not as a political stunt but because lives are lost.  , 6 \"no words.\" Yes, there are words: gun control. , 6 Still waiting for that mythical \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d platitude. How many more have to die before the country wakes up to the realization that there was only  one John Wayne and he\u2019s not coming around anymore., 6 Well, Republicans in Congress, you have done it again  -- let Americans die, be gravely injured, perhaps maimed for life, be horribly traumatized -- because you would rather receive the millions of dollars in campaign contributions from the NRA than protect the lives of your constituents.  When are you going to start honestly recognizing that the Second Amendment never ever contemplated automatic rifles and such in the hands of ordinary citizens.  Republicans, you are all detestable cowards, completely morally bankrupt.  I am sickened once again at knowing so many have suffered today, and I grieve for them.  I am terrified for my nieces and nephews who are teachers and for my great-niece and great-nephew in elementary school., 6 Two facts: there are 1.5 MILLION AR-15's sold every year in the USA of NRA. Second, the Governor (Scott) and the Senator (Rubio) and the republican state legislature of Florida have done everything possible over the years to make sure this kid and anyone else could buy an unlimited number of AR0-15s and an unlimited rounds of ammo in the state of Florida. Vote people, vote like the lives of you and your children depend on it because they do. , 6     Florida School Shooting Suspect Nikolas Cruz Was \u2018Creepy and\n    Weird,\u2019\n                                       The Daily Beast, today\n\nWhy can weirdos get legally get their hands on guns?   Start there.\n\nFrom : Mental Health vs. Gun Control: A Devil\u2019s Bargain (2014)\n\n\" GOP Rep. Tim Murphy, a clinical psychologist from Pennsylvania introduced a rather sweeping bill, The Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (H.R. 3717). While some of its provisions are no doubt debatable, overall it would provide an unprecedented array of services to people struggling with mental illness and their families. \n\nSo far the bill has 86 co-sponsors \u2014 and 50 of them are Republicans!\"\n\nThis is politically doable - start there., 6 This person could have bought a rifle and picked up biathlon and become an Olympic athlete. But no, this person bought a military grade weapon meant to kill many people. And the killer is still a child too...Mental health issues is just as important as gun control. I mean this crazy person could have sexually assaulted the girl he was obsessed with. He could have committed suicide. He could have harassed someone on social media and lead others to suicide. He could have done anything else but he decided to kill a bunch of people at his old school anyways. He had access to dangerous weapons that really meant to be used like this but vendors don't really care how their product is used as long as they get paid. I understand that. I'm sure weapons manufacturers aren't doing the business to have people attack schools. It just happens because it's possible and there are crazy people who will do it. This child was crazy and until he can treat himself with respect, he would have caused some harm to someone anyways. I'm not sure if gun control would really stop these sad crazy people. It's just crazy to give freedom to these people who will cause harm wherever they are. Why don't we have gun owner's insurance that pays for victim's lives that their guns might take on accidents? We might as well pay for life insurance for our kids in the future since these stuff probably won't stop., 6 \u201cI spent a career carrying typically either an M16 or an M4 Carbine. An M4 Carbine fires a .223 caliber round which is 5.56 mm at about 3000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It\u2019s designed for that,\u201d Former Gen. Stanley McChrystal explained. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what our soldiers ought to carry. I personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America.\u201d, 6 Vote against any candidate for office who has an A rating from the NRA.  No exceptions., 6 \nI'm sickened at this news.\nI'm so tired of lighting candles.\nI'm so fed up with thoughts and prayers.\nWhat's it going to take?\nNot the bought-and-paid-for congress.\nNot -- oh, god no! -- the NRA.\nIt's us, us -- on a neighborhood level, community level, the statehouse, the ballot box.  It's us who have to treat candidates with a high NRA rating with as much disdain as we would reject a candidate endorsed by Big Tobacco., 6 The killer's parent had trouble handling her son and frequently called the police to \"talk\" to him, yet she knew he had guns. Parents must take responsibility and there needs to be severe penalties for such parental irresponsibility. And, of course, our children are dying for lack of gun control., 6 The United States has less than 5% of the World's population.\n\nThere were 18 school shootings in the rest of the World in the last 2 decades - \n\n- and 18 school shootings in the United States in the last 35 days.\n\nEither we have the most disturbed population on earth by many orders of magnitude - \n\n- or we have an insane tolerance for allowing ourselves to own and use weapons of war., 6 The real tragedy here is that nothing will change.\n\nAnother mass shooting, another massacre, another presidential regretful tweet, another wave of outrage and vigils\n\nBut nothing will change. Onwards to the next mass shooting., 6 Anyone would think that school shootings are the US national pastime.  Any gold medals being award for these efforts? Perhaps a national medal of Honor is overdue? Or, just maybe, the voters are happy to sit back and watch the entertainment?, 6 \"The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors.\"\n\nAny need for further comment?, 6 How is it that the \"right to bear arms\" trumps the right to life?, 6 Queue the comments berating the NRA, Republicans, gun culture, etc.  And in about three days, this incident will be forgotten and we\u2019ll be back talking about Russia and Trump\u2019s latest tweet.  And that\u2019s why nothing ever changes., 6 Ignore the charges of politicization, Democrats: be bold, and make this a 2018 issue.\n\nWe need strict gun laws.  Now.  Hammer it home until it filters through., 6 This is just the end of what we can accept anymore in this country.  Congress will do nothing so I hope somehow all of us who have commented on this tragedy in the NYT will join together and start a movement that the fools who represent us will not be able to ignore. Not sure how I will start this in my community but for me not to do anything other than comment is not enough.  So please all of you think how we can start a movement so much bigger than the small minds that we have voted into office., 6 Another shooting. More condolences from our politicians. Another check from the NRA to these same politicians. People, we too have a weapon - the power to vote. Perhaps if more people voted for politicians who support gun control, we actually can make America great again., 6 America is raising a new generation of hands-ups.  The adults in this country are the most irresponsible ones there are in this world.  , 6 It is time to get rid of the second amendment. We got rid of slavery and that was in the constitution, so we can get rid of this. Do I want to come after your guns? Yes. Yes I do. At least the semi automatic weapons and the bump stocks. We can all have the firearms they had in George Washington's day, how about that. , 6 If Sandy Hook failed to incite action, I fear nothing will. The Republicans in Congress, pockets stuffed with NRA cash (some of it Russian) will offer the best thoughts and prayers money can buy, though.\n\nSpeaking of the NRA, as I write this, a blurb on their website assures us: \"On Hannity, NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre let Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer and their anti-gun minions know that the NRA will not tolerate their use of a tragedy in their war against the Second Amendment.\" How's that for striking the proper tone?, 6 We really need these weapons in our lives? We really need them to circulate unregulated through our society so that a handful of paranoid lunatics will feel reassured in case the Chinese or Russians decide to invade? What nonsense! We deserve better. These children deserved better., 6 This insanity will never stop as long as we have these absurd gun laws. , 6 Don't worry, Big Gun Lobbyists and Big Gun Manufacturers, nothing will come of this. Millions of Americans will angerly and bitterly mourn the loss of innocent lives once again. It's what we do. You can keep manufacturing guns we have no business possessing, stockpiling weapons to alleviate an obsession that the \"Russians are coming\" to take our land away from us and some lunatic will keep murdering civilians just to keep your stock prices high. Congress will do nothing because they like how much you pay them to keep their antiquated thinking alive and the sane, normal society will rant and protest while nothing changes. You win, Big Gun Lobbyists Congress, you win - for now. Some day, however, I believe our younger generation will outlive you and on that day - justice will finally be served for all who've died from your mistakes. , 6 Mandatory buyback of assault weapons. Now., 6 Round and round we go....everything that needed to said already has been... it\u2019s time to start taking some action.\n\nWhy not call your congressman tomorrow!?, 6 I heard a law enforcement person say: \u201cThis is our society. We don\u2019t have the wherewithal or guts to change it.\u201d If we can\u2019t muster the National Will to deal with this type of carnage on our streets. I say the heck with it. Just let Putin, The Russians and China take over. Maybe they can do a better job than the people we\u2019ve elected!, 6 Eighteen shootings in 35 days? A shooting every other day? This is madness \u2014., 6 So what? Shhhh.. we can talk about gun control later. Now we will mourn and pray and then keep on selling more guns and supporting less, preferably no, gun laws- till there is no one to buy guns - by grace of guns!\n\nGreed by NRA and gun manufacturers and desperation of GOP to get money from them and vote in the name of 2nd amendment will continue to win this battle and lives will continue to be lost. , 6 1. Our hearts go out..\n2. Thoughts and prayers\n3. It\u2019s too soon!\n4. Rush on gun sales\n5. Lawmakers.... Crickets\n6. Rinse repeat , 6 I\u2019m so sad for these kids, their teachers, and their families. This should never have happened.\n\nYet it keeps happening. How many more people - and how many more kids - need to die or be grievously injured before we enact sensible gun control laws in this nation? How many more families need to be torn apart because some lunatic thinks it\u2019s his God-given right to air his grievances via automatic weapons? How many more thoughts and prayers are we going to offer up before things change? \n\nCloaking these tragedies in the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t solve anything. This isn\u2019t about responsible gun owners who practice safety; it never was. They aren\u2019t the types who do this sort of stuff to begin with, and they don\u2019t need automatic weapons to effectively secure their homes or go hunting. This is about some seriously deranged people in this country who want to hurt others, as many of them as possible, and it\u2019s about time we made it more difficult for them to do that. Responsible gun owners, we need your voices on this: your fellow citizens are being slaughtered by crazy men, and thoughts and prayers won\u2019t stop it. Effective gun laws will and we need you to help us lobby for, write and enact them. The right to bear arms doesn\u2019t include the right to deprive others of their lives and liberties and deep down, you know this. \n\nTo our spineless politicians: I dream of a country where this sort of slaughter doesn\u2019t happen. Do you? Don\u2019t tell me how sad you are: I don\u2019t care. Do something. , 6 When a massacre of this magnitude affects the children of the very people who support the nra and the arms manufacturers then maybe something will happen. Until then money and power will trump all., 6 The NRA rates candidates and mobilizes voters accordingly. When will there be a movement to make an NRA \u2018A\u2019 rating the kiss of death? Or maybe nobody cares in which case we should just say thoughts and prayers and get back to regular programming., 6 Guns matter more than me.  Well, I\u2019m old.  Guns matter more than my granddaughter.  Yours too.  \n\nThink about that.  , 6 A public identity is all many care about, especially the young. It\u2019s why they can be convinced to blow themselves up or convince themselves to shoot up a bar, school or whatever., 6 I know of no one, personally, who wants to see kids gunned down in schools yet there must be a number of them out there because nothing is being done. Certainly people would cry out if this were perpetrated by foreigners.  But what is different? Why is it OK if they are American citizens? Because they were born here they are free to kill others who were born here? Sure, much discussion will take place about this killer's mental state but if he didn't have an assault rifle maybe fewer would have been killed and why not implement BOTH gun control and increased mental scrutiny? \n\nI want our Representatives to do something or, at least, get out of the way and let us citizens write some laws., 6 Why is this even news? There is nothing . . . absolutely nothing . . . that sane people in the US can do about this. We the  People. Are. Powerless. The rage and frustration is beyond words. , 6 Here's the modus operandi...\n\nMass shooting\nToo recent to talk about it\nmedia reports fade over time\nNothing happens.\n\nRinse and repeat\n\nStill waiting for the \"right\" time to discuss the Vegas shooting......., 6 I don\u00b4t believe that guns are the problem in the United States. I believe that the problem occurs with improper education, and media. Kids these days play video games that insight shooting and murder. These games have such an impact on these people that they begin worshiping these games and losing touch with what is right and wrong. Kids are playing these games that are rated for 18 years old and higher. I just do not agree with guns bring the only problem. I believe the problem lies within mankind. , 6 Ah yes, the obligatory \"Send prayers and thoughts their way, mantra\" Idiotic words, with no intention of changing anything. They (the NRA and the GOP politicians who receive donations from those agents of death, know all too well that history will repeat itself again, and again, and again. And they will give voice to the same empty platitudes again and again, and again. America safe?? Don't make me laugh. I would be safer in Iran. , 6 Sheep in a field.  Shooters decide to pick off a bunch.  Nobody does anything.  Congress is gutless.\n\nDon't talk to me anymore about this.  I don't care anymore., 6 POTUS amends the 2nd Amendment: \"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,\" That statement reflects ignorance of Constitutional Rights. That statement is a testament to the hate you are spreading, giving license to greater atrocities not intended by our founders (\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"). We the people hold you and the NRA responsible for this atrocity and those preceding, and all to follow. Having the right to bear arms is not the same as the having the right to murder. Given your arrogant statement to be able to shoot someone on 5th Avenue and be absolved, you have Twittered away the lives of innocent children \"in absentia\". Happy Valentines Day Massacre., 6 Those opposed to further measures that would curb these senseless events suggest that it is a mental health issue.  I agree, but not in the way that they suggest. I believe that those elected officials who continue to have their votes bought and paid for by the NRA are the ones who should have their mental stability checked.  One would have to be crazy to continue issuing statements of \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d while doing absolutely nothing to limit access to the implements of so much murder., 6 Every politician with an A rating from the NRA just took away any chance of these children ever earning their own A in school and life. , 6 Nothing will change, absolutely nothing., 6 We all know what our President and all our good American friends in Congress will say:\n\nNone of these kids would be dead if the libs had given them the right to carry loaded guns on campus.\n\nBen Carson said that after a college shooting, and of course 45 said the same after the massacre in the Paris theatre.\n\nWe live in a culture that places the right to own a gun before the right for unarmed people to live. The 2nd Amendment stacks the deck against those of us who don't carry or own a gun.\n\nYou don't see anything like this in China, where guns are banned., 6 This is Trump\u2019s carnage... his American Carnage.\n\nLet\u2019s all sit back and keep score.\nMaybe 2018 will top 2017 in our national love of gun carnage. , 6 We need much more of this kind of killing.\nThis  occurrence is not going to move the needle.\nIt\u2019s only the 17th school schooling this year.\nWe\u2019re falling short.\nWhen we get a school shooting EVERY DAY maybe our government will think differently and maybe find a better benefactor then the NRA. , 6 There have been so many mass murders that they are not even big news anymore.\nA case like this, with 17 children dead should paralyze the country in panic, remorse and fury, but in the US of the NRA we will be satisfied with Pence\u00b4s thoughts and prayers.\n\nAnd the NRA will increase sales because we need more good guys with a gun to protect us from other guys with a gun. Right?\n\nWake up call? Too late, our morals are dead., 6 Come on Americans!!! If Newtown didn't  change things, nothing will! It is up to us, as citizens, to DEMAND changes! Who are your senators and representatives in the pocket of? Gun Lobby? VOTE THEM OUT! We can not rely on them. It is up to WE THE PEOPLE. We need to be heard and above all RESPECTED. , 6 What's wrong with this country? Australia had one horrible mass shooting and assault weapons were outlawed. What in the name of God are we waiting for?  , 6 Just another day in the USA. But don't mention gun control. Too soon., 6 The school knew the gunman was a potential threat, yet he had all those guns. Ah, America. Will she ever learn.d, 6 People forget that there was no such thing as a police force when the Bill of Rights was written. So instead we had \"well-regulated militias\". \n\nYes, citizens should be allowed to own guns...when they are trained police officers. They are still citizens, after all, and not the military. A civilian police force would be a reasonable protection against tyranny. This is just mass murder of our children, because gun owners don't care. The fantasy of their potential power and heroism is more potent to them than other people's dead children. , 6 Over half of Congress loves guns and money more than our children. There is no other way to explain their inaction., 6 Outrage. Horror. Disbelief.\n\nReading the commentaries, it is deja vu. 2018 has already reached 18 school shootings.\n\nBut what will this rage produce? What have all the others accomplished?\n\nThe Republican controlled federal government will do nothing\u2014don\u2019t want to upset the faithful. The Republican controlled Florida government will do nothing\u2014don\u2019t want to upset the faithful.\n\nEven some Democrats have scaled backed their crusade about guns\u2014hope to win over some of that \u201cfaithful.\u201d\n\nPeople kill people not guns. They\u2019ll take our guns away. Not the time to discuss gun control. 2nd Amendment rights.  \n\nWe Americans have no problem spending a trillion dollars a year on security against being killed by a terrorist, however unlikely, but are stymied when it comes to having 13,000 citizens victim of gun homicides each year\u2014that is 4 World Trade centers each year.\n\nIf guns are not the problem, then that leaves one very unsettling option\u2014we the people of the United States. May be it is time we take a very small baby step and rescind the Republican order that prohibits the Centers for Disease Control from investigating the causes of gun violence.\n\nYes, even this small step will not see the light of day either. \n\nWhat enormity must occur before effective actions are taken?, 6 \"The only thing that stops a bad child with a gun is a good child with a gun.\" Guns for all school-aged children! I'll bet that Disney and Marvel will be trademarking character inspired gun models ASAP., 6 Why should kids right to live supersede the unfettered right to automatic weapons? , 6 The \"man\" who is the shooter is a 19 year old late adolescent with a troubled past. How is it that he was not flagged as a high risk?, 6 Just look at the people that own and shoot military type weapons and semi-automatic handguns. They can be generally described as weak and scared. Many of them are scared to death every minute of the day. Because they are weak and powerless, they are afraid of becoming a \"victim\". The NRA and the gun manufacturers take advantage of these poor suckers and sell them more and more guns, but they are still weak and afraid. Unfortunately, we don't have the means to figure out which ones of these frightened creatures is so mentally unwell that they think shooting up a school or a concert is a grand idea. So what to do?  Talk to your neighbors and family. If they have these types of weapons, you should feel bad for them, for they are scared (and likely on the lower end of the intelligence spectrum). Treat them like a frightened little child who is separated from their mother. Tell them it's going to be OK. Don't threaten to take away their precious security blanket for that will make them ANGRY and they will throw a fit. Gently, slowly, tell them that strong, powerful, confident, respected people don't need military weapons. Lastly, it is important that you communicate that \"guns aren't cool\"..... , 6 With the GOP majority currently in Congress, I doubt gun sales will go through the roof tomorrow. Must be a real bummer for the gun manufacturers. , 6 I do not want to hear any politician say \u2018that the victims and their families are in my thoughts and prayers\u2019. To which I say this is the most insincere comment that I hear coming from their hypocritical mouths, they do not care a bit for the victims and their families BUT they do care about the money and the votes they get from the NRA and its fellow fanatics. Maybe if they see a few photos post death of the victims and what these weapons do to a human body that might move them. What if one of their children ends up a victim of school or any shooting, would that cause them to see another side to this issue?\n\nThe second amendment says \u2018 a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms ,shall not be infringed\u2019. My thing is the first four words, I hardly consider our over armed citizens are a \u2018well regulated militia\u2019, far from it, more like the lawless west., 6 The worst part about it is that our nation will do nothing about it. The trolls are already out everywhere talking up guns and people continue to buy into that logic. \n\nI don't even know what there is to be proud of anymore as an American. I am deeply ashamed. , 6 \"Students huddled in horror in their classrooms, with some of them training their cellphones on the carnage, capturing sprawled bodies, screams and gunfire that began with a few shots and then continued with more and more. \"\n\nThe United States of America is an insane asylum. , 6  Who could possibly defend our insane \"gun rights\" after another mass shooting?  Has the right to own automatic weapons improved the quality of life in this country? Does your family feel safer? Do all the guns equal less crime?  Do you really care that children are being mass-murdered?  Would you sacrifice your children to protect people's right to own automatic weapons?\nThis is on the NRA and any politician on either side of the aisle who takes their blood-soaked money. , 6 This has nothing to do with violent video games. People play them all over the world. This has nothing to do with horror movies. I watch them to unwind after a hard day\u2019s work. This has nothing to do with mental illness. There are plenty of crazies everywhere. There is only one reason for the violence that is drowning America: guns. If you have a gun, you will eventually shoot somebody. Chekhov said that a gun on the wall in the first act of a play will have to shoot in the last act, and this apples to life as much as art. Asking a gun owner not to kill is like asking a pressure-cooker owner not to cook. Every tool has a purpose and it needs to be used for the purpose it has. The purpose of a gun is to kill. So why are you complaining that guns are used as intended? Until the Second Amendment is repealed, more children will die., 6 The Columbine school shooting was in 1999. Not one thing has changed as far as passing common sense gun control laws. In fact, military-grade assault rifles have gotten easier for people to own, regardless of their mental health history or criminal/violent backgrounds. The NRA began as a group of hunters who were sportsmen. They are now controlled by gun manufacturers. The NRA controls Congress, and most state legislatures as well. Anyone notice that it's still legal to sell bump stocks (devices that allow a semiautomatic firearm to mimic a fully automatic one), even though in the days after 58 people were killed outdoors on the Las Vegas Strip last October, members of Congress promised to ban them. What happened? The NRA and their $$$$., 6 Q. How many times can Republicans turn their heads and pretend that they just don't see ?\n\nA. As many times as they need to in order to keep themselves, the NRA and DJT happy. I know, I know, ... we are not supposed to 'politicise' this. But it is precisely this denial to recognise the crux of the problem - the grand alliance between NRA and GOP that has led to this problem. The 'silent majority' and the so-called evangelicals have driven the country to complete and utter moral bacnkruptcy and this is just yet another example of what such ignorance can lead to., 6 And still, they cling to guns and prayers, for their guns have no bullets, and their prayers can resuscitate dead children. \n\nMy sincere condolences for all the people directly affected, too much to bear. , 6 At least we have our thoughts and prayers.  We are all set.  Nothing else needed.  Done.  Over.  Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.  The good lord watches over us.  Not to worry.  I'll write after our next massacre. Will be soon.  But I will send my thoughts and prayers.  , 6 Get rid of the guns. \n\nI think you lose the \u201cright to bear arms\u201d when you can\u2019t responsibly honor the original intent of this amendment. \n\nGet rid of the guns.\nGet rid of the guns.\nGet rid of the guns. \n\nIt\u2019s a broken record. America is broken. , 6 The problem is not guns, it's people like Nikolas Cruz who come from broken homes where there is no father figure present, thus no discipline, which resulted in his expulsion from school. The breakdown of the American family unit, total absence of a father figure, as in Cruz's case, not to mention Adam Lanza's case. Cruz clearly had anger management issues, which arise, once again, from the lack of discipline., 6 Addressing  mental health problems is always the focus of those \u201cleaders\u201d on Capitol Hill who have chosen to take no regulatory action with regard to fire arms. But, it is this very population that needs to have its own mental health and fitness for office evaluated. Perhaps it is not too late to give them some insight on the negative impact of their choices on our society. Sure., 6 Question to all news outlets: why do you continue to publish the names and pictures of shooters? \n\nThe most nihilistic humans will kill themselves but only after taking as many lives as possible just to hammer home the point of how meaningless life is. Those that are too cowardly to take their own lives after such acts hope to, and successfully do, become famous by living on as spectres that haunt us through the news and online.\n\nIf the perpetrator has been arrested, they should be redacted from human history as soon as possible. This isn\u2019t a call for gun reform, it\u2019s a call to nullify these individuals\u2019 desires to become immortal and make it known that infamy will not be granted any more., 6 How do parents explain to their children that adults will do nothing\u2014nothing\u2014 to keep them safe in school, in church, at the mall, at the  movies?, 6 Wake up, America.\nThis doesn't happen in any other country in the world. Not one.\nThink about that.\nOnly in America.\n\nNO MORE REPUBLICANS, EVER., 6 Don't worry the Florida government has a plan - they are going to use tax dollars to pay for the funerals and counselling but will never use them to actually address stopping it from happening again., 6 Nothing's happened since the last one. Nothing is going to happen until the next one., 6 All together now.... \"My thoughts and prayers go out etc. etc. etc.\" \n\nForgotten by tomorrow teatime., 6 Another testament to Florida's vaunted death penalty.  They will, no doubt, execute Mr. Cruz relatively soon.  I guess it's clear how effective a deterrent that is.\n\nYes--we need to address mental health issues.  We need to address the mental health of people who feel they need military weapons.  We need to address the mental health of people that think an automated gun registry is a bad thing.  We need to address the mental health of congresspersons that would rather listen to the NRA than their constituents.  And we need to address the mental health of the people that vote for them.\n\nSpending time and money on these kinds of weapons is a pretty clear indication that the buyer wants to use them., 6 With Trump and his band of Republican hotheads running the federal government, the number and frequency of these random mass shootings is about to be reversed, for all of the wrong reasons. It won't be because the NRA is suddenly de-funded, or because several gun manufacturers 'got religion.' Rather, the potential shooters will be caught up in a new draft to fight a massive new war, thereby taking their aggressions out on enemy combatants, rather than neighborhood schoolchildren and concertgoers. , 6 To any non-Americans reading this, we Americans who are sensible are imploring you to cancel any vacation plans you may have to the US.  Please tell the airlines, the hotels, Airbnb, etc., your reasons for cancelling.  Tell them that you feel that to travel to the US is to take your life into your hands, and that you will make no other plans to come here until such time as our congress enacts meaningful gun reform laws.\n\nPlease also tell all your non-American friends who had plans to come visit the US, to do the same.  They must cancel their travel here, to send a strong message to our government.\n\nWe Americans are respectfully asking for your assistance in this matter, to help keep us and our families safe.  Tourists from outside the US contribute a lot to the US economy, and so perhaps this is what it will take, for our government to take notice.\n\nThank you very much for your consideration.\n\nSigned,\n\nAmerican Citizens for Meaningful Gun Reform, 6 I recently picked up a copy of Guns & Ammo...the gun industry's newest push is to legalize silencers for all weapons in all states.  The editor stated that they would need to wait a few weeks before starting the new campaign, because 600 people had just been shot in Las Vegas, and emotions were a still a little raw at the time.  When this legislation is passed, which is certain, the children will have no idea which direction to run.  The number of fatalities will climb, with each successive incident tallying the largest school/mass shooting because without the sound of gunfire, people will take longer to realize what is happening and run for cover or escape.  And shooters seem to be in some kind of contest for being the \"most.\"  Bump stocks are still perfectly legal and silencers will be soon...at a store near you (or a gun show near you in case you can't pass a background check.). Only in America, God help us.  , 6 How could we miss it?\nAll the warning signs were there !\nrepublican delinquency while our \"Elected\" President Obama shed tears for those who were mass murdered, and for those he knew were yet to be mass murdered.\nAll the warning signs were there;\nBlood running in the aisles, into the gutters, down the sewers, all because of republican delinquents who do nothing about easy access to assault weapons.\nAll the warning signs were there;\nrepublican delinquents greedily scarfing up money from the NRA, twiddling their thumbs each time innocents are slaughtered, doing nothing as the body counts rise.\nAll the warning signs were there;\nWhen the Trump mocked Mrs. Clinton and rallied support for the \"Second Amendment People\" to prevent Mrs. Clinton from nominating Supreme court judges.\nAll the warning signs were there;\nWhen the whole republican latrine of snakes, Trump's head protruding out the top and his base of gullible worshipers obscenely cheering him on while he does his Trump rumba to the scene of obedient gerrymandered republicans wallowing in the Blood Money from the NRA.\n\nAll is not hopeless. Trump lost the election by 2,900,000 ballots. We just need to stand up for OUR country.  We did not elect him. , 6 If I had to send my child to a public school these days they would be wearing bullet proof vests. If I could, I would train them on how to use a small Saturday night special pistol, which I would allow them to tuck into their jean pocket. This is because there is no other way to safely send your kids to school these days. It is a crazy idea. This why I would never send my kid to any school. I would home school them on the very programs that are being advertised now on TV. It is not worth it to send a kid into a battle ground. In fact, Child Protective Services could say as a parent, I am putting them in harms way and I am not keeping them safe by sending them. Because it is apparent that the ammunition and magazine style guns these insane men use on our kids, which in effect means many shots fired at one time, is easy to acquire, and not one person in control of our laws has bothered to find a way to get rid of the easy access of these machines for ordinary people and people with ill intent, I would never send my children to any of the schools in our county. Why President Trump can you not solve this? You have a son that is 11. He could be next. Former President Obama, why did you not solve this? What a stupid senseless waste of our children's lives because Washington will not solve this or even do anything to change the chances. , 6 Wayne LaPierre and the NRA does not care about these children. He and they do not care about any of our children. (I'm not sure that Mr. LaPierre has children or any notion of what this means to parents.) Mr. LaPierre cares about his million dollar salary and keeping a bunch of congressmen in his pockets. , 6 The first four words of the second amendment are:\nA well regulated militia...\nEven if you want to extend \u201cmilitia\u201d to imply \u201ceveryone\u201d there\u2019s still that  term \u201cwell regulated\u201d that we can\u2019t ignore. , 6 There is no way our current politicians in Congress will lift a finger to do anything about gun control. Unfortunately, that's just the way it is. Fortunately, however, there IS something that WE THE PEOPLE can do about it. In November 2018, we can VOTE OUT those politicians who support the NRA (and whom the NRA supports). Just go look up the \"letter grades\" that the NRA assigns to politicians in Congress. We can VOTE AGAINST any politician who has a \"good grade\" from the NRA, and VOTE FOR any politician who has a \"bad grade\", or any political candidate whom the NRA is against. We HAVE THE POWER to do this. Just vote against NRA-supported and NRA-supporting politicians. JUST VOTE!, 6 Congress has already decided this issue: Murdered school children are not too high a price to pay. This isn't even news any more., 6 What are 17 lives worth in Douglas High School in  FL?\n\nAnswer:  The cost of putting metal detectors in every entrance in the school!\n\nHow much would that cost?\n\nThat dollar amount is what 17 lives are worth!\n\nFirst, metal detectors!\nFIRST!\n\nThen talk about gun control.\nThen figure out mental health in the U S.\nThen figure out violence in America.\n\nFirst, prevent deaths in schools.\nFirst metal sectors in all entrances in schools.\nFIRST\nFIRST\n\nThen figure out the rest., 6 Too many guns.  Too many assault rifles.  Too much ammunition.  Easy access. to all.\n\nThink guns aren\u2019t a problem?  Look around the world.  We are at the top of the list in these types of senseless massacres.\n\nToo many guns.  And an impotent Congress and President, led around by the nose by the NRA., 6 Nothing will change until we ELECT MORE DEMOCRATS.  The New York Times had a brilliant piece on October 4, 2017 profiling the TOP 10 recipients of NRA Funding in the Senate and the House. ALL ARE REPUBLICAN. This article makes it very clear why Republicans are so opposed to even reasonable gun control.  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-..., 6 Today was the first time I told my 8 and 5 year old daughters that there had been a shooting at a school on Florida that killed 17 children. I have had multiple opportunities, literally, to tell them about previous school shootings but my instinct has always been to shield them from the inexplicable. I can explain that a young man had a gun. I can explain that guns kill. I can explain that people die when they are shot. I cannot explain why our lawmakers are so impotent and ineffective in the face of problems with simple solutions.  \n\nMy five year old responded, \u201cMom, why was there a soldier at the school killing children? Or was it a hunter?\u201d, 6 Sigh. This again. Same actions, same conversations, same lack of action. This is just our reality in America. Our options are complete apathy, constant fear, or some nauseating combination of the two. Superb., 6 I dare someone to try to explain to me how the Second Amendment is more important than those children's lives., 6 It'd be appropriate if \"Gun Rights\" activists did not express their condolences and this time. They are responsible that this country still experience so many deaths. , 6 Ordinary people being slaughtered is the price of freedom.\n\nA price that rich and well connected Republicans never have to pay.\n\nHas it occurred to anyone else that the refusal to pass gun regulations is a Republican form of terror? , 6 Unthinkable tragedies.  Alll man made.  Unfortunately it is only in America.  Unfortunately it will never end.  Almost every other day.  There is school shooting and deaths.  As long as guns are available, there will be mass shooting BECAUSE it is not possible to avoid discontentment and disgruntlement in human society.  It is just being human that some people are unhappy at other people.  It is the choice this country made to have guns available to the people, happy or disgruntled.  Really really sad.  So many young innocent people have to lose lives so prematurely., 6 I work at a school that experienced two credible and terrifying death threats last year, both from angry men, one alum and one current student. Tonight I watched the video of a classroom during the shooting. The students dropped behind desks, screaming. It was far too easy to imagine that was my classroom and my students. I\u2019m terrified to go to work tomorrow. My students are scared this might happen to them. This must stop. , 6 As long as the underlying and persuasive attitude in our society is that violence is the only way to solve one\u2019s problems, whether mental, physical or emotional, we won\u2019t solve the killing sprees that take advantage of our gun happy and antagonistic states of mind of our American world.  Looking at society, we see that the adults of our leadership are afraid to be understanding and respectful of others.  So, why shouldn\u2019t confused and unstable people believe that life is me versus them, and believe that going on attack is their only outlet for frustrations with which they can\u2019t deal.  Unfortunately, the NRA fully supports easy access for the unhappy and hurting people to have their revenge against those who they feel betrayed them., 6 Sadly, it seems as if we need a new \"thoughts and prayers\" emoji to send each time we read an article depicting a new shooting incident. It is almost as if we are becoming desensitized by the ubiquity of the horror and loss. Perhaps we need to play a collage of videos for voters as they enter the election booth this year, as a stark reminder of what our failure to enact meaningful gun laws produces. Or maybe we can just keep the hope of a secure, safe, and happy childhood for our kids in our thoughts and prayers....because that is the only place that it will be., 6 Thoughts and prayers?  Is that all you have to offer?  That and $3.50 gets you a cup of coffee at Starbucks.\n\nIt's not that congress CAN'T do anything about the issue, it's that they WON'T., 6 How does this kid afford such weapons and ammo while working at the dollar store? I assume he used credit - we should require credit cards to prevent transactions for weapons. , 6 As long as the USA has a serious gun culture, it will have a serious gun carnage problem. The inertia isn\u2019t due to the politicians, it\u2019s due to the populace. Too many Americans value the dubious right to own lethal weaponry over the collective right to live relatively free of the worry of death or serious injury from guns, the way almost every other first world nation does. , 6 How do we live in the so-called most advanced country and so-called greatest country in the world, yet mass shootings of innocent people continue to occur? Clearly, we are not advanced and not the greatest. , 6 It's time for martial law, which suspends the 2nd Amendment, until gun control legislation is enacted.  , 6 We we had a smaller incident here in Idaho in 2015. My best friend and two others murdered, her schizophrenic son incarcerated for life... and members of three victims\u2019 families still struggling with nightmares, PTSD, and trying to get on with life after the horror of it all. In addition to the obvious impacts on the victims, there are incalculable psychological and medical costs to families and community members connected to these tragedies. I have health insurance, but my uncovered psychiatric costs have racked up thousands of dollars. The impacts will reverberate for at least a generation. These shootings have become a major public health crisis, and soon they will have touched us all. Maybe then we will realize that the right to bear arms in the form of an AR-15 and to have infinite stores of ammo is not an inherent constitutional right. This is crazy. This has to stop., 6 Votes and prayers.  Votes for sanity, votes to ban the \"casualty multiplier\" of semi-automatic weapons and large magazines in civilian hands., 6  Feeling sad and hopeless isn't enough. I want to do my part, however small, to stop something like this from ever happening again. I hope that coverage of this tragedy will include information about gun control organizations to support, and a guide to current gun legislation in each state., 6 The Supreme Court will soon decide that it is wholly acceptable, Constitutionally protected even, for each and every U.S. family, that they be prepared to lose 88.9% of their children to gun violence. And then the Court will be off to a corporate-sponsored luncheon. This American experiment is a complete failure. , 6 Senseless slaughter of innocent children. Again. What will it take for elected officials to disregard $ from NRA and represent the will of citizens and parents? This is not a second amendment issue. It's a safety issue and we are the global poster child for unchecked access to guns. Of course mental health is an issue, and of course you pray if that helps you feel better. But it is action and change we need at this point. Again what will it take?, 6 In society today we have become nearly numb to headlines as gruesome as this one. In a world with as much violence and turmoil as today it's extremely hard not to. Despite this, we as the human race need to really step back and take a look at what the problem is here. The horrific scene in Parkland Florida is the last thing ready and able students should see when pursuing academic excellence. Personally this impacted me greatly because I am from Florida. Seeing kids like this, terrified and frantic, I think back to when I was in High School and even now. What if this happens to me? That is the question nearly everyone who sees this article asks. With such a vast amount of mass shootings nowadays it seems like only a matter of time before it happens to someone you know or even you. Looking around for some sort of explanation to this madness all I can think of is anger. The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was expelled from the school before the shooting. This has to be the catalyst as to why he would even fathom an idea of this brutality. Also, in today\u2019s world younger kids are much more oblivious to violence and death becomes of video games like Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, etc. What should be done going forward is more education as to why these weapons are dangerous and how to use them for the right reasons. If we, as older people, do not hare this knowledge and education with the younger generations then who will?, 6 A sad, sad day.\nAmong other lessons, this tragedy highlights that despite MSM\u2019s relentless attacks against law enforcement officers, our police officers and deputies continue to charge into danger, willingly risking their own lives to save others, especially our children.\nMaybe we should take a moment to reflect and thank God for the incredible devotion demonstrated by the police officers and deputies at the scene, and be a little more hesitant to castigate the vast, vast majority of officers and deputies for the sins of the very few., 6 The world is wrong, and it feels like there's little I can do except cry.  At 1:30 I was leaving the home of a good friend in Parkland whose daughter was in the school that lightning struck today.  Except it wasn't an act of God- it was an act of absurd gun laws meeting untreated insanity.  We've gone too far in the weapons we allow and the policy of not committing the violently mentally ill.  All the law abiding good gun owners in Parkland could not help those children today.  , 6 Come on USA, make some serious and meaningful changes to the gun laws. 18 school shootings in 2018 already and still there will be people saying owning a military style weapon is fine.  , 6 Well, USA and many of its citizens rely on academic arguments to explain away these frequent happenings. The main argument is these things happen globally. All one can say is good luck. Denying the social issues such as gun violence, drug problem, racial divide, growing intolerance and economic divide...and painting that USA has never been a better place and no other time was better than what we live...This is a Trumpian speak and nothing more.Our heart goes to the families and friends of those who lost their lives to this mindless violence. , 6 Why, when I see headlines like this again and again, do I just say to myself, \"There's nothing I can do.\" I am resigned to the fact that, despite my great desire for gun control and the regulations of horrific weapons like the one used in today's killing spree, my voice is nothing compared to the voices of people who have been brainwashed to believe the government is coming after their guns. Fear trumps reason once again, forever, it seems, and always. \n\nI'm tremendously angry at the NRA and the fear-mongering its done for so many decades. Disgusted at the politicians who take their money. Appalled by the inability to vote for representatives who will use common sense to regulate the gun industry and our American fascination with violence. \n\nI am heartbroken for the young lives lost and the families whose lives will never be the same. Tomorrow, I'll get up, kiss my kids good bye, go to work and hope it doesn't happen to my family. That seems to be all I can really do., 6 If we are to accept the stock NRA argument that these countless mass shootings are not caused by the vast availability of arms in the US - availability that is unprecedented in other countries - then we must also accept the argument that the US is a country with more violent and disturbed people than perhaps anywhere on earth. , 6 How much are 17 lives worth at Douglas High School in FL?\n\nHow many dollars would it have cost to install metal debtors in every entrance of that school?\n\nThat is how much 17 lives are worth at Douglas HS in FL\n\nWould metal detectors have saved 17 lives?\nYES\nThe cost of metal detectors is how much 17 lives are worth.\n\nFIRST metal detectors to prevent death.\nFIRST\nTHEN discuss gun control.\nTHEN discuss banning assault rifles in the US.\nThen discuss the cause of violence n America\nThen discuss mental health in America.\n\nFIRST metal detectors.\nPrevent death.\nTHEN ......., 6 Why AR-15 is given to public. Other than police no one should have permission to use it. , 6 18 school shootings so far in the year 2018. By what measure is this acceptable?   How many more lives will be lost before we take action to reduce the number of guns in the US?  I work in the next town over from Sandy Hook and we all thought that horrific massacre would be it, would be the one to shake the status quo, but no, nothing changed despite a huge outpouring of anguish, sympathy and support from across the country, no, the world.  We need to put an end to this madness. Please pressure the politicians to address gun control before more innocent victims are massacred. , 6 Just in case you haven't figured it out yet, you, and those you love. are not entitled to any part of the unalienable rights regarding life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness that the lobbyist at the NRA, and the gun manufacturers  supports.   \n\nIt's time to quit stepping over the dead and measuring in body counts, and start finding out how much blood money is contributed to whoever you may support in Congress.  Then remember it the next time they're up for reelection.  Passing new laws are a only band aid next to assertively getting the actual champions of gun-support-to-the-point-of-insanity out of Congress once and for all.   , 6 I don't want to live in this country any more. I can't live in a place where it is now accepted as normal that children will be mowed down in their schools. I can't stand listening to the obligatory \"thoughts and prayers\" that fall from politicians lips and are devoid of meaning or purpose. No more moments of silence, please. It is a crime that our politicians have lobbied their hearts out to ensure that any citizen can possess any weapon he wishes and take it anywhere he pleases except for the halls of congress and local state houses where the same politicians are unashamed to protect themselves. Enough of this obscenity, 6 Once again tragedy in America in which multiple homicides are committed by a U.S. citizen possessing an assault-type killing machine designed explicitly for that purpose. Once again American politicians wring their hands, call for days of national mourning, and (ultimately) do nothing to restrict or remove assault-type killing machines. Last month Kentucky, this month Florida, and next month? The N.R.A. has your politicians by their check books and American civilians die as a result., 6 You don't show the gunperson's planned escape route.  It killed two people just outside the building and then someone watching it on a street corner as it made a run for it while discarding it's bullet proof vest and AR-15 with multiple magazines.  Eventually, it was caught a mile away.  It almost got away with it. , 6 Who are these politicians who pride themselves on representing the rights of gunners to deprive children of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness? We are a society promoting death. The powerful right-to-earn-capital of old people trumps every time the rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of youth and families because we value death over life. Conflicts like this are not unknown in a democracy, but our sorry democracy has allowed capital earnable by corporations which arm lunatics always to win over human lives having interests in health, safety, law, order. One or two United States Senators seeking improvement are continually beaten down by 97 or 98 Senators promoting the almighty dollar for minority-gun-people. It is never publicly acknowledged that victims come from NRA families. Considerate reporters do not ask. Bullets departing from barrels do not choose what they run into. The deceased cannot speak. Their families, depriving future families of right to life, soften loss by sticking with Trump, who was right about Fifth Avenue., 6 So:  more carnage, and the political and ethical pygmies in charge of this country will wring their hands for a day or two, wail and moan about how terrible it all is, but that this isn't who we are as a country, before moving on to something less uncomfortable.  Well, this is exactly who we are;  if this wasn't who we are we would have taken the first steps long since to begin to put a stop to these horrors.  A society that refuses to protect its own children is one that will end up destroying itself.  Think about it., 6 Why are we surprised at this?  I recently counted 5 movie previews -- of films catering to kids this age -- every one of which  was FILLED with anger and violence and death and despair.  Television is no better.  So why are we shocked when kids' heads are filled with garbage that they then act out in real life?  There is a word for it: GIGO.  Until we put a stop to Violence As Entertainment this scenario will continue ad infinitum.      , 6 As Congress is poised to pass a law that essentially permits people to carry concealed weapons anywhere in the US if they have such a permit in the place they reside, I wonder what kind of a world we are living in.  As we permit money to highjack our political system to argue that semi automatic weapons are a constitutional right, I wonder if this is a world I wish to live in. Guns in the hands of people kill people.   They are a clear and present danger. Why is it that, when even the exercise of first amendment rights is subject to reasonable time place and manner restrictions, we can\u2019t impose the same  measure of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of our second amendment rights?  This is irrational and our children and other innocent people will continue to die needlessly. When will our legislators and Supreme Court Justices start using their heads instead of being used by lobbyists whose only concern is power and money. I am sickened by the lack of moral compass in government., 6 I'll say it too: not the right time to talk about gun control but provide thoughts and prayers?!? Thoughts and prayers won't bring back the innocent dead. Tell us when you think is the right time for the discussion & I---and many others---will be ready to discuss it, if necessary, to the last syllable of recorded time. We'll discuss it until these legislators and gun-owners weep for mercy and silence. But then, let's not talk about mental health issues. If that young man hadn't had a gun in his hands, he would not have had the power to kill so many, so quickly. That is very simple to understand. And finally, when when WHEN will a human life have more value to these legislators and gun-owners than a gun? , 6 Of the almost endless list of reasons not to support Republicans, this one has to be near the top - they are owned by the Gun Makers Lobby, a.k.a., the NRA.  \n\nRepublican Governor Rick Scott, with his A+ rating from the NRA, is on right now actually asking \"How can this happen in our country?\"  , 6 This is not about Trump.  Columbine was 19 years ago.\n\nHow many schools have installed metal detectors on every entrance to the school?\n\nWould metal detectors on every door of that high school saved 17 lives?  YES!\n\nThen focus on gun control.\nThen focus on banning assault weapons.\nThen focus on mental health in America.\n\nFirst, metal detectors.\nFirst!, 6 Gun freedom, like all freedoms, has a cost and more of America's children just paid the price again today for our right to pretend the second amendment doesn't reference militias. Sad., 6 Prayers and thoughts to the students, their families and the community. How much more of this tragedy do we have to endure? #enoughisenough, 6 What is this -13? 14? \"school shootings\" so far this year? Or does this get counted as a 'mass shootings' category, instead of 'school shootings' category? Now its time for the \"thoughts and prayers\" statements... the NRA to point out that its not the gun doing the shooting (even though it is, really). Time for the gun lobby to point out that we already have \"plenty of laws, we just have to enforce the ones we have.\" Time for Trump's inane statement. And then time for no action, nothing tried, nothing at all to be changed, so that this happens again, just like it already has, over and over and over.\n\nOK - let's try a new script: This is a \"terrorist incident\". The shooter is a \"radical terrorist\" (insert a religion in there if it makes you feel better; clearly however else he worships, he worships guns). Now that this is a \"terrorist incident\" instead of just another ordinary All-American gun violence ignoritcident, can we get some action behind some new ideas? Can we infringe on some citizen's civil liberties, ignore some Constitutional Amendments, like we do when addressing \"radical terrorism\" from other countries? Why do we eagerly spend Trillions, invade countries, and willingly fight back when it is \"radical terrorists\" killing a few dozen Americans a year, and yet we roll over, claim \"there's nothing more we can do\", and let tens of thousands of Americans die every year from All-American gun violence? What is it going to take before our Congress gets serious about this?, 6 \u201cThis is not the time to talk about gun control. This is the time to join in mourning those who have died in this senseless attack. Our thoughts and prayers are with....\u201d\n\nGun violence will never end in this country. Gun ownership is so extensive, and the belief in the right to own and carry lethal hardware will never ever change. \n\nThe Columbine disaster taught law enforcement important lessons to apply when\u2014not IF\u2014the next shooting occurred. \n\nWe in education have had numerous training sessions on how to secure our buildings, train our staff members, and our students what to do in active shooter situations. \n\nWe have the Incident Commander protocol firmly in mind. Kindergarten children take the training in stride. \n\nIt used to be that we worried about fire, tornado drills, snow load on the gym roof. \n\nWe as a nation will never rid ourselves of these realities. We will keep practicing our drills, pray that we will be exempt and when disaster strikes hopefully we will be able to acknowledge that one of our first thoughts will be, \u201cThank God it happened there and not here.\u201d, 6 The NRA and Wayne LaPierre are in charge of gun policy, Grover Norwuisg is in charge of taxes and the budget, and Vladamir Putin heads foreign policy. All three are invulnerable and call the shots. The President and Congress are figureheads and the people are pawns or entities in the food chain.\nCertainty prevails re no change in gun safety laws. , 6 The constant chatter that people kill people, not guns, just doesn't work anymore.  Guns are a problem and United States needs to take notice.  , 6 Trump on twitter: \"\u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting.\"\n\nPoliticians that can do no more than offer \"prayers and condolences\" are not doing the job for which we taxpayers are paying them. This is nothing more than pious irrelevance and triviality. SKIP THE PRAYERS AND CONDOLENCES; DO SOMETHING!, 6 With a history like his, why in the name of God didn't someone report him to the police?  Hasn't anybody there heard of \"If you hear or suspect something, say something to someone you trust\"  This tragedy could have been prevented., 6 Why are these types of weapons allowed to be owned by private, \"non-militia\", individuals in a non-regulated society.\n\nThere are so many loopholes in our laws that I feel these laws are a sad joke.  Does any elected official care about these tragedies?  Prayers-and-thoughts ..., indeed.  \n\nOn Ash Wednesday we should think about what Jesus said about justice and love.  , 6 Just saw the sheriff and the governor speak.  The sheriff said if we're on the internet and we see something, we should say something.  I saw something, sheriff.  I saw a sheriff and a governor too cowardly to admit that there was something they could do.  I saw a governor to scared of the NRA and the Putin Right Wing to get the guns in control in Florida.  I saw people who want us to pray instead of getting rid of the guns.  I saw a coward thank  Donald Trump for all the help -- which worked how well?  I saw a sheriff tell us that they were doing everything they could but trying to teach us there is nothing we can do if someone makes up their mind to kill a large number of people.\n\nI saw abject cowardice and the tryanny of the NRA.  Hope this tip is helpful., 6 In every other developed country in the world, this kind of tragedy would be a seminal, soul-searching event. In this country it's ... just Wednesday. , 6 Gun control will never happen. Its not the politicians or the NRA, its the millions of voters who will never allow it. The only thing to do is keep gun control in some states so there is a haven for those who would like to live normally., 6 When will we stop electing politicians who are in the pockets of the NRA, who care less about the lives of our children than filling their campaign coffers, who can draw the distinction between assault weapons and guns used for hunting or self defense, and who can stand up to the bullies who distort the second amendment as being the holy grail of our constitution., 6 I realize Republicans don\u2019t care about American children, but don\u2019t they care about their own children?  Do they think their own children are safe?  Maybe they just don\u2019t care.  , 6 Heartbreaking. Every time this happens I watch the news and see people running from the scene. I can't run or move quickly because I use a wheelchair. I'm doing the only things I feel I can: I relearned CPR and first aid, carry a trauma bag with tourniquets on my wheelchair, always try to map out the fastest exit routes, and vote for lawmakers I feel will make responsible decisions about gun control. \n\nIt's a sad day when civilians in American have to carry military-grade tourniquets around., 6 I\u2019m glad my children are out of school but sad that I have to now worry about my grandchildren getting murdered learning their ABC\u2019s. We can\u2019t stop this horrible tide of violence while politicians on both sides of the isle do nothing. They ALL have blood on their hands and so do we for voting for them. All they care about is either what illegal money they are getting now or how much money their \u201cservice to their country\u201d will make them after leaving office. It\u2019s a shame that our great country is now full of untreated mentally ill people with easy access to weapons they have no business owning and a government full of people who will not act. , 6 \u201cThere are no words\u201d the sheriff says. Just use the same ones they used last time, and the time before that. Words are futile. There is no solution except to remake your country. Make a new one without so many twisted and terrified people in it. Try catching those people in some sort of social safety net. That\u2019s what every other country does. Works great. , 6 Failed society. Utter collapse of our society. There are no excuses and there is no justice. , 6 We need a new gun tax\nLets called it a \"gun tax for school safety\".\n\nIn this tax,   all those \"gun in very corner\" proponents as well as the  AR-5 gun and high capacity magazine enthusiasts should pay 50% tax for the purchase of a gun  and for each bullet.\n\nI propose the tax should  be used to pay for bullet proof windows, state of the art x-ray machines, SWAT trained policemen at ever entrance and of course bullet-proof vests for every teacher, principal, custodial worker and school worker who is expected to use his/her body to shield our children.\n\nThe Price of the 2nd amendment should be the empty wallets of the NRA fanatics  not the lives of our school children , 6 I find it interesting, to say the least, that whenever one of these massacres occurs, one of the first things people do is question the mental state of the perpetrator. One would really start to believe that mental disease only or primarily strikes the people of the United States; that, in this respect, a curse has been placed on the country while all other countries on Earth have been spared it. There is a curse, alright, but it is nothing to do with the mental capacity of the American people; rather, it has everything to do with the mentality of a subsection of the American people. Specifically, it is their belief that the death of innocent children, some as young as six and seven years of age and whose only \"crime\" is to get an education, is the price that must be paid for the right to bear arms. It is this belief that is criminal. More important, it is the unwillingness of lawmakers to stand up against the NRA that is both criminal and abhorrent, afraid as they are that doing so will not only cost them their seat in Congress but, above all, money and power!, 6 As someone who knows parents of Douglas students I am heartbroken, not only for them but for our country, which has become the poster child for the killing of innocent children, sacrificed on the altar of political dysfunction.  , 6 I often wonder what it might take to find a way to curb gun violence.  And regardless of the facts you selectively use to support a specific position, it is hard to argue that limiting access to firearms and ammunition would be a move in the wrong direction.  \n\nAnd even if enough people got on page agreeing that something must be done \u201cthis time\u201d, history has a terrible track record. We have traveled this road so frequently we are simply numbed by the news of yet another school shooting.  \n\nSo what may work?  What might mobilize enough phone calls, letters, emails, marches, rallies, and disgust?\n\nI suggest it is time to remind all of us of the horrors first-responders had to face in Columbine and New Town.  I would guess that not one eye witness would argue against sensible gun control legislation.  It is time to release the crime scene pictures in hopes to mobilize an Anti-NRA movement.  While most certainly objectionable, I am plum out of ideas.  \n\nI am not a thrill seeker nor can I fathom the pain such a plan would unleash.  But anyone who still believes letting civilians own and carry weapons of mass destruction for simply recreational purposes, needs to see the byproduct of their blind support of the NRA, and this includes all those elected persons who consistently have found excuses to limit access to unnecessary firearms.  We are not talking about hunting weapons. \n\nShow them the bloodied hallways of New Town and then let them tell those parents it\u2019s just too bad. , 6 This is every parents nightmare whether they love guns or hate those weapons.  As parents we grow weak in the knees every time an episode like this hits the airwaves.  Our heartfelt condolences to the parents of the young teens hardly begins to express the sorrow.  Your loss is our loss.  Your child was our child.  Your grief is our grief.\n\nYet, even with all the advances we have made with our economy, technology and everything else, i cannot help but think that a society which cannot come to an agreement on banning sales of weapons to the public simply cannot be viewed as being civilized.  So long as we place our citizens ( young or old) in the path of danger in order to live out our fantasies with weapons we must contend with this hard truth - America is a nation of savages as much as it is a nation of innovators, artists and educators., 6 Valentine\u2019s Day, a day of love.  Now a date for a school massacre.  A day that will, for some, forever be day of mourning.  \n\nThis is just so tragic.  So senseless.  Such a sad ending for Valentine\u2019s Day., 6  Not to be callous, but I no longer consider these typ of events worthy of national attention.   They are sort of like a car accident.  These things are going to happen and there is nothing that can be done about them since we will never restrict access to these types of killing machines., 6 Now let's hear the familiar refrain of recycled and reused phrases and prepared speeches which are paraded by the usual characters everytime a tragic event like this happens.\n\nThey all start something like \"We stand with the victims and their loved ones...\" , \"Mental health...\" , \"Our hearts go out to...\" , \"This is not the moment to discuss this...\" , \"Do not use this tragedy to politicize...\", \" Guns do not...\", \"Guns are not...\" , \"Responsible gun ownership...\" , \"I own like 30 guns but...\" , \"This deranged individual does not represent...\"\n\nMeanwhile more families will mourn those they lost,  more survivors will be left with the scars of this tragedy...all under the impression and reality that nothing will ever change.\n\nAnd so on to the next mass shooting and tragedy..., 6 According to the NPR program \"Marketplace\", the are more retail stores that sell guns in the U.S. than there are Starbucks in the entire world., 6 For years we have been told that the answer to these type of shooting is more guns, yet the number of mass shooting continues to go up and in worse shape.\nAt what point our politicians are going to say NO to gun lobby money and accept facts that guns are primarily an instrument for killing and it is our kids, father and mothers, sisters and brothers that are being killed in our schools, shopping mall and work place., 6 Oh, yeah, and I also saw an attorney general tell us she's been there before, because she was at Pulse, and she'll pay for the coffins.  There's a person who should never be put in a position of responsibility ever again., 6 Let's have a massive national walk-out - all students, teachers, and support staff. Make it April 20th, the anniversary of Columbine. Show our political leaders that nearly 20 years have passed, and our gun laws reflect no progress. , 6 When a family loses a loved one unexpectedly\u2014 a young person\u2014especially a child, it's devastating. The grief has the ability to destroy them. Add violence to the equation, it's got to be hideous. Imagining a bullet tearing through the flesh of someone you know, the pain, the fear. But sadly, we as a society, seem to have grown numb to it.\n\nIt's easy to say or send thoughts and prayers but it's hard to do the collective soul searching to make sensible change.\n\nAuthorities in Florida, bless their souls, are sounding cautionary. In a nutshell, they said tonight at a press conference, if you see something unusual or hear unusual talk of violence, or see someone with a lot of guns, call authorities and let them know. There was talk of mental illness.\n\nBut answer me this. Is it not unusual that an 18 or 19 year old man can get his hands on an AR-15? I don't know any hunter who needs an AR-15. Does anyone need an AR-15 for protection?\n\nThe Colt AR-15 is a lightweight magazine-fed, gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. It was designed to be manufactured with the extensive use of aluminum alloys and synthetic materials. It is a semi-automatic version of the United States military M16 rifle. It is a weapon of mass destruction. \n\nToday's tragedy holds up a mirror to America. We're a violent nation. We tolerate this. And although it's been normalized, the pain will never go away for those who lost a child, sibling or a friend today., 6 Why are AR-15s legal? When will this insanity end? How many more mass shootings must we endure? None of this makes any sense., 6 \"The gunman, armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle....\"\n\nI cannot fathom why military-grade weapons are accessible to civilians. The right to bear arms? To hunt? For self-defense? A hunting rifle, I understand but why on earth can an assault rifle and \"countless magazines\" fall into the hands of private citizens? They're only designed for one thing: to kill. \n\nThoughts and prayers are not going to be bring these kids and countless others back to life. The only thing we can do is prevent more horrific deaths like these. Everyone who is at least a little bit saddened by this incident, call your reps demanding change EVERY WEEK until we see sensible gun control. We grieve. We feel angry, but all too soon we forget and move on with our lives. \n\nNo more. Our congresspeople need to held accountable but we need to start with ourselves. I for one am putting it in my weekly planner. , 6 Perhaps these United States should follow the path of the Soviet Union, and split up into two or more countries, in as amicable a spirit as possible. Because our society no longer seems to agree on a common set of fundamental values. Personally, I want to live in a society where there is strict gun control. And I would consider moving to Canada or Europe with my family, but those nations probably wouldn't be thrilled to have any of us, at this point., 6 So far no one has been quoted as 'shocked and saddened'.   I guess the powers that be are beyond that point., 6 When you think that our Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has and will continue to spend infinitely more time and resources in banning marijuana than in trying to fix the gun problem in this country, you have to conclude that we have a leadership failure in America., 6 This is the result of the glamorized gun culture in our society .\nNo other developed country has these \u201ctragedies \u201c.\n     The tragedy is that our country puts gun rights over the right of its citizens to have basic security .\n    The United States has become a world wide embarrassment . , 6 It\u2019s Wednesday in America. There will be another one tomorrow. Rest well. , 6 anything can be weaponized. you cannot blame the implement, only the mindset. what about fertilizer bombs, large trucks, airplanes, super soakers modified to be flame throwers, cell phones, sugar, being fat? \n\nour freedoms do come with inherent risk. 1 in 4 car accidents are a result of texting and driving. how many result in fatalities? we should ban cell phones, cars and being fat, too. because those all kill more than guns every year., 6 I'm tired of hearing about government solutions to ongoing social disasters.  When a parent doesn't provide support to a child to help them cope with the most basic of life occurrences, that child only learns how to deal with them in dysfunctional ways.  A child needs a parent's love, guidance, and sacrifice.  Our society is riddled with parents that are not providing these things at levels anywhere near what a child requires, and this is an extreme result.  There is no government solution for that, the responsibility is ours., 6 The time is ripe for the USA to do the self appraisal on its' action against the number of bullets spent outside the USA to bring peace against the action taken to prevent the spray of bullets spent on the tiny tots and innocent children in schools.  The ratio might be optimum to zero. Indeed a paradox till date., 6 Sorry but we are going to have to make a much-needed amendment to the constitution., 6 Such a sad story.  More gun control will not work.  It is already totally illegal for citizens to possess weapons on this school's grounds.  Fl Statute 790.115: Possessing or discharging weapons or firearms at a school-sponsored event or on school property prohibited; penalties.. .  commits a felony of the third degree,.  That is serious jail time and should be a deterrent.  Disturbed people will do bad things regardless of the law.    , 6 My fellow citizens, how can we stand this any longer?  My heart aches!\nShooting after countless shooting, our government has continued to take no action to make our schools safer.  We need to look at the facts.  The US has the highest rate of gun deaths in the world.  The consistent difference is the vast availability of firearms in our country.  Now, I know there are many Americans that equate the right to bear arms as their patriotic duty (I am not one of them), but clearly there is a need for sensible gun laws.  For me, Sandy Hook should have been the moment for change.  We have not done our job.  Justice will not be served for these souls or their families until action towards gun regulation is taken.  Until then, \"thoughts, prayers, and condolences\" are short lived sentiments.  \n\nGod save us from ourselves. , 6 What an awful travesty for this school community in Florida. My thoughts and prayers are with them. I mourn also for American education in general. My high school generation lived through the shock and trauma of the Columbine massacre in 1999. For years, I would relive those media  images when my students and I completed lock down drills in the high school where I used to teach. To this day, I still keep my classroom door locked at all times and warn my students to take these drills seriously. We shouldn\u2019t have fear in learning environments, but that\u2019s just the way it is. , 6 No more thoughts and prayers! Gun control legislation is the only sensible solution. No more election of NRA supported political candidates, period. Then some sanity may appear in Congress., 6 Lock all entrances from the outside. Keep the inside main entrance opened with a security guard at the door. All students should file in individually and go through a metal detector. Then lock the outside main entrance.   , 6 AR-15's are killing machines. When used as designed, they maim and kill with precision.\nEvery company that manufactures or sells these assault weapons knows that criminal misuse is foreseeable and all too common. Background checks and tightened gun control laws are not enough, IMHO.\nWhen products are designed in a way that makes them inherently dangerous, manufacturers and sellers are often strictly liable for any resulting damages. Common sense suggests that the gun industry should be held to the same standards., 6 And 'President Trump' offers his 'thoughts and condolences'\n\nSurely, that will fix this never-ending problem, in a country obsessed with guns., 6 Okay, okay- so, as usual, it seems that everyone wants to make this about guns instead of talking about, oh, I don't know, PSYCHOLOGY or INCOME INEQUALITY (Broward County being a very poor, very brown Blue county surrounded by red), or the dangerous modern dating culture among youth, which fetishizes stalking and violence  a la 50 Shades, aided by social media...\n\nFine. Let's talk about guns, then. Let's talk about why police needed MILITARY-GRADE weaponry to take down just one young adult. Let's talk about why at anti-Trump protests here in NYC, attended by CHILDREN and the ELDERLY, we are often confronted with police armed with military weapons.\n\nNo wonder they want to increase military spending. The militarization of our police force is happening before our very eyes, and yet no one wants to talk about it..., 6 Our U.S. Government spends lots of time and money identifying, monitoring and combating \"terrorist organizations\" - both here and abroad. They do it to protect the safety of American citizens.\n\nBut they also gladly and openly accept vast sums of money from another terrorist organization. In turn they vote to advance the goals of this terrorist organization, goals which have proven to cost vastly more Americans their lives than the combined actions of all the rest of the terrorist organizations on the face of the Earth.\n\nThe political clout and money of this terrorist organization just snuffed out the lives of another 17 Americans today in Florida - because they actively subvert the will of the majority of Americans who desperately want to see \"sensible gun control\" legislation - including a robust assault weapons ban.\n\nYes, this terrorist organization I speak of is the NRA. And Wayne LaPierre has more American blood on his hands than Osama bin Laden ever did., 6 In a video on the Washington Post website,  there's a clip of students in classroom listening to the gun shots, screamimg in unimaginable fear.  Imagine how terrified they were. Imagine the terror of the students and teachers who were in the room with the shooter. \n\nEvery member of Congress should watch and listen to the video. Every member of Congress should look at photos of the dead first graders at Newtown. They should look at photos of today's massacre. They should hear the names of every child and adult who was killed. What he or she liked to do. What his or her dreams were.\n\nThen every member of Congress should imagine how they would feel if their son or daughter or grandson or grandaughter was was one of the students lying dead in the classroom.\n\nMaybe those pictures should be made public. Imagine the pictures on the front page of every newspaper, on every news and social media website. \n\nThere would be an outcry, there would be outrage at the  dead children being exploited. But maybe there would also be outrage that such horrific violence is allowed to happen,  enough to do something about it. Maybe enough people would say they've had enough. Just maybe., 6 Recently there was mention of the National Rifle Association as a possible conduit for pouring Russian money into the Trump campaign.  This aspect of the Russia investigation was mentioned briefly in passing, it seems, and I have not heard anything more about it.  It would be wonderful if Bob Mueller could make a case for conspiracy which would take down not only Trump and his whole crew, but the NRA as well.  The NRA should be prosecuted under the RICO statute  -- the NRA as a corporate entity, in addition to past and present NRA executives as individuals.  , 6 The way we tell what matters to Congress, as with all of us, is by their actions. If children being slaughtered in their schools, regularly, doesn't matter to them, nothing matters., 6 and yet, like clockwork, the Republicans will have nothing more than hopes, prayers, and easier gun access., 6 How long, how long, will we as a nation put up with gun  catastrophes which happen on a regular basis the the USA?  When will common sense prevail?  No other nation lives like this.  We are in thrall to the NRA and the crazies.  It took 1 mass shooting in Norway for legislation to prevent carnage.  Every time I travel anywhere in Europe I am asked \"How do Americans let this happen?  It belies decency and common sense.  If the children of Senators and Congressmen were slain perhaps we would see a common sense response.  , 6 Unless Americans get serious about gun control and start taking guns away from citizens- all citizens- then all of this coverage of this most recent shooting, all of the lamenting the senseless deaths of 17 people, won't matter at all. But I have absolutely no expectation that the US will do anything. After 20 toddlers were brutally murdered in Connecticut and the American Congress still kowtowed to the NRA, the reality remains that the gun sickness in the US is as intense as ever. Newtown proved that there was no depth to which the US would not sink in its pathological fixation on guns. What is another massacre? Just another atrocity for which Americans will normalize., 6 As usual with these increasingly common incidents, we hear prayers and condolences from politicians who have no intention of doing anything because they are either paid off by the gun industry or afraid to incur their wrath.  And we hear this every time: \"We have to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.\"  This makes a false amalgam between people suffering from clinically diagnosed mental illness, and shooters who act out of blind rage or some kind of lethal obsession that is not obvious to anyone until it is too late.\n\nThis stigmatizes mental illness and is a diversion from addressing the problem of widespread availability of military type weaponry.  I'm not opposed to all gun ownership, whether for hunting or self-defense.  And of course any gun can be used to kill, as well as a knife, baseball bat or a brick for that matter.  However, assault rifles and military weaponry are in a different category, since they can be used to kill large numbers of people in a short time, and there is little or no defense against them in civilian life.  \n\nHonest hunters have no need for such weapons, and their offensive capabilities far exceed their usefulness for \"self defense\" against the kinds of assaults that are most commo, including the type we've seen today. \n\nShills for the gun industry sometimes argue that if everyone were armed we would all be safer.  That might increase their obscene  profits, but in reality it would make everyone much less safe., 6 Why are semi-automatic weapons legal in this country? How does this promote the common good? Does anyone seriously think that the Founders would have countenanced these weapons of mass destruction?, 6 We KNOW that the NRA is the recipient of millions and millions of dollars in Russian cash that is laundered through to ad campaigns to promote Republican lawmakers who will do the NRA's bidding.\n\nThis is a means to destroy our country and kill our children.  Russia doesn't allow guns to this extent, but the Russians fund the NRA so that gun control in America is impossible?\n\nI hope Mueller extends his investigation so we know how much money from Russia is underwriting the evil NRA to win the hearts and minds of  uneducated Americans who believe that it is patriotic to demand that every American be able to own assault weapons to mow down their fellow Americans.\n\nThis needs to stop.  And the Russian connection to this needs to be exposed., 6 This is the real face of terrorism.  Who will protect the homeland from the NRA?, 6 Trump will build a will, which he \"has to\", because of his promise.\n\nAnd that will most certainly keep out the bad \"hombres\"., 6 \"There are no words\" says Sheriff Israel.\n\nThe words are:  impeach all of DC.\n\nA lottery to replace Congress would do better., 6 Gun control now. , 6 The Constitution guarantees our freedom to have our children massacred.  , 6 What more needs to be said.\nYou live by the gun, you die by the gun.\nThe tragedy is that supposedly the greatest country on earth is also the most stupid and because of its insistence in allowing its citizenry to arm itself, the most heartless.\nThis is just another everyday massacre. So many more to come as nothing changes., 6 Those lame-brain Republicans and Trump only offer prayers and condolences.  What good are they if that's all they have to offer?  Kick them all out of office.  ASAP., 6 Cruz?  Wonder what ethnicity is since we're always so fast to point our when its a white shooter., 6 I'm sure trump is totally opposed to school shootings, but thanks to the NRA, and their moronic followers ... thoughts and prayers..., 6 America cannot get guns to killers fast enough...  \n\nT&amp;P (why bother with thoughts and prayers) none of which are ever answered\u00e2\u20ac\u201d- Trump base should put on their NRA baseball hats...\n\nPut more bodies on the scoreboard..\n\nDisgusting., 6 Congress needs to ban assault rifles, 6 Come on DC -\nGet on a plane, invoke God for the cameras, then return to fund the military and build a wall.  Failures, all of you, 6 Every parent, as they send their children to school each day, should stop and say to themselves, \u201cIt is possible that I am sending my child to his death today.\u201d  When we do that, when we admit that we send our children to school to be sitting ducks for a monster with an arsenal every single day, maybe then the outrage will be big enough to take the Republicans out.  Because yes, it is the Republicans (and a few Democrats) serving their master - the NRA - that are responsible for every single one of these deaths. They have got to go.  It\u2019s on us as parents to get them out., 6 The statement most repeatedly mind numbing is \u201cif law enforcement didn\u2019t act quickly it could have been a lot worse\u201d. Really? A lot worse than 17 dead? Than 1 dead?, 6 Regarding the latest Florida school shooting:\nThe measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it\u2019s the same problem you had last year.\nJohn Foster Dulles, 6 Why are guns banned from Congress, but not from everywhere else?  What are our leaders afraid of?, 6 Federal, state, local action is required. Educate and eliminate. It is clear that this is everyones' problem. , 6 Republican thoughts and prayers go out to all those at the NRA who were affected by this terrible tragedy.  Everyone, please, respect their feelings at this difficult time., 6 More effectively fortifying schools, greater control on availability of assault weapons, \"if you see something say something\" - none of these things go to the heart of what the US faces. They are sticking plaster solutions, and in many ways they just further exacerbate the problem. Americans today live in an atmosphere of fear. They bring up their children to live in fear. In such an atmosphere people will necessarily become obsessed with guns. Many people feel having weapons is necessary to feel safe. It is a sickness of spirit that needs to be addressed. Feelings of fear and anger have become a normal way of life.  Both fear and anger readily breed violence. More attention needs to be paid to what actually constitutes good mental health in society.  Is a society that is obsessed with reality shows and celebrity culture a healthy one? From top politicians downward, there is so much unbalanced behaviour and lack of integrity that we witness every day, Is it a wonder that unbalanced behaviour begins to manifest at all levels of society? Every child deserves good mental health, deserves to be given the tools to understand and manage their own thoughts and emotions, rather than being medicated when these things become troubling. People need to start asking why the US is such a violent society.  , 6 You have to remember that the NRA is just another trade lobbying group. The only way their members make money is to sell more guns. Since their market is saturated (i.e. way more guns than than people in the country) they have to keep finding ways to scare persuadable people into buying even more guns. So they (or the guy at the local gun shop) start rumors that \"the government\" will take away everyone's guns and then fools run out and buy the latest assault weapon. Or they say that the solution is for everyone to tote a shootin' iron. In short they hide behind the 2nd amendment and the rest of us have to deal with the mess that results., 6 Congress wants to pass the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 allowing an individual to carry concealed firearms to any state or locality regardless of local laws banning them. To add insult to injury, that person is not subject to the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone, and may carry or possess a concealed handgun in federally owned lands that are open to the public. This is so morally bankrupt by an measure of decency.... , 6 we need to take an unconventional approach to gun controls, California imposed restricted gun law when Reagan was the governor, the reason he  imposed that was, bunch of black panthers showed up to the government buildings with their right to carry.  Would it work if we arm the African-American to the teeth and ask them to demonstrate their gun rights ?, 6 At one point, the shooter had been expelled from school and was known \"to be into guns\" by posting on social media.  I can't imagine that no one from the school reported this to the authorities?  While I understand that a crime had not been committed then, someone should have been tailing him.  I want to know what authorities I can turn to if I ever notice a mentally ill person who is \"into guns\".   Something has to be done., 6 If you can no longer stomach living in the United States of Insanity, and you have the means, you should get out and go live in a saner country. Because, simply, nothing is going to change in this Insane Asylum. Not now, not in a generation, not in two generations or four. The Insanity is systemic and ingrained: the jingoistic adoration of the \u201cmilitary/industrial complex\u201d; the racism and its attendant hatreds; the incessant war-mongering; the reverence given to a perverse interpretation of the Second Amendment; and yes, the endemic stupidity that both infects and \u201cinforms\u201d this nation\u2019s antiquated politics. And oh yes, last but not least, the gross economic inequality. These are not discreet elements in the fabric of the United States of Insanity but, rather, interwoven threads: a suffocating quilt of economic, social and militaristic backwardness that snuffs out virtually every national element of progress and decency., 6 Good thing the NRA isn't funneling millions and tens of millions of Russian dollars into supporting Trump, because then he might not try to do anything about this horror and so many others like it. , 6 once again\nmilitary weaponry does what it is designed to do:\nprotect our Constitutional rights., 6 Shootings at schools in the USA are becoming common events... and, to be frank, no one with access to power seems to care...not really.  Any political action on the part of lawmakers in power is non-existent.  They won't even talk about it.  In the meantime, independent polls indicate that 90% of voters support gun registration + gun safety classes (similar to Drivers Licenses), but the majority in Congress does not want to touch the topic.  Our society is so morally bankrupt that there are probably people making bets on when the next school killings will occur., 6 One wonders.  Have we civilized our values so deeply--domesticated them, perhaps--that we deny ourselves the civic energy of angry revenge? \n\nEmpathy? A sense of moral indignancy? Compassion?  These will not turn the political tide against those who would continue to allow these travesties in the name of political protectionism.  We need moral outrage (emphasis on the latter!).  We need to rise up, hand in hand, and scream them out of office. This is not a time for thoughtful debate.  It is a time for the forces of political revenge to tear through these districts with a howl equivalent to the horror it would erase. , 6 This doesn't seem to happen in elite schools where politicians and Presidents kids and grandkids go to school - why is that? - probably better run and organised. Demand more of the same in your lower and middle class schools so as to prevent this event happening again. Doesn't happen in rich kids schools so politicians and White House doesn't care., 6 Every gun-supporting politician and interest group mouthpiece interviewed in the coming days who parrots the same tired excuses should be unequivocally shamed by the moderator for doing nothing than merely offering empty condolences. Put their shame and cowardice out there for the world to see at every opportunity. , 6 Next year, 2019, will be the 20th anniversary of the Columbine school shooting. As we witness another tragic event of the same magnitude, we must ask ourselves what, beyond the rhetoric, have we done to curb this kind of senseless violence.\n\nWhat we will do, again, is get angry, point figers, argue about gun control, look to Congress to implement laws and policies, and bemoan the senselesness of it all. Until another occurrence of this nature rears its ugly head and spews our collective oh-no-not-again mantra.\n\nWhat I observed a few years ago in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook killings--and steadfastly continue to brlieve- might not a politically correct things to say, and it may appear to be a fairly callous and insensitive thing to say, but say it I will:\n\nWhen little blond-haired, blue-eyed five and six year old children are murdered in cold blood and nothing  is done in Congress to address gun control, this problem of gun violence will continue to fester like a sore., 6 Okay. let's arm teachers and principles at schools to respond to shooters. Would 9mm Berettas or Glocks be enough to stop an AR-15? Would the NRA'S philosophy only by\nbring us a lower body count, as maybe just a couple initial victims get killed, and then a responder or two, and finally the shooter? Or do we arm the school staff with automatic weapons too? Would this be progress? How crazy has 21st Century America become?, 6 Do your job, Congress! Ban the manufacture, sale, or possession of automatic or semi-automatic weapons IMMEDIATELY., 6 The second amendment was based on the fear of slave rebellions in the southern slave states. It has nothing to do with hunters rights or protecting one's home from a burglar. A musket vs a AR15 i don't think the correlation or the concept of an automatic weapon was in the founding fathers minds. The fear of a slave revolt was.  , 6 Guns & Ammo magazine ranks states for the most  lax gun control laws. Florida is #12: \u201cThe Sunshine State places no restrictions upon modern firearms, magazines or NFA items, and the state has a healthy competitive shooting network.\u201d\n\nRead more: http://www.gunsandammo.com/network-topics/culture-politics-network/best-..., 6 A sadness for what has happened in that school. \n\nI want to share a reflection. \n\nA few days ago, a Latino man killed a football player in a car accident. Trump wants a wall across the border with Mexico to stop crime.\n\nThis is just one of 18 shootings in the year only in the United States. All of them were perpetrated by American citizens. 17 students died at this school until now. Nothing happens, the law allows the guns. Explain this to parents of students killed.\n\nThe criminals are inside the American land, they are their own citizens. \n\nWe will continue reading of massacres in the United States in the future. Meanwhile, Trump will continue fighting for their wall., 6 Editors, please set a precedent and do not report the shooters name or publish his motives if not terrorism,\nA sick desire for recognition or sympathy could be a factor and we do not need to inspire more copycats., 6 Does this school have metal detectors at all entrances?\n\nTo partially use Rachael Denhollander\u2019s question during her victim statement at Larry Nassar\u2019s sentencing in Michigan recently:\n\nHow much are 17 lives worth in Broward County FL?  As much as the school could have spent to install metal detectors on all entrances?  What price is human life?, 6 The shooter, used an AR-15 assault rifle, capable of firing off 6 shots in one second. That is the potential of killing six people a second.  And yet we still allow the sale of this killing machine. And didn't the Congress promise us to outlaw bum stocks which allow these weapons to go fully automatic? What happened to that legislation. Oh wait, it didn't get the approval of Wayne LaPierre and the National  Rifle Association, I guess. , 6 you reap what you sow, i guess., 6 Just another day in what we have become: a death culture., 6 Cue the \u2018thoughts and prayers\u201d., 6 Every day life in America, thanks to the NRA and the GOP. , 6 Another dark day in a nation that values guns over the lives of our youth. \n\nHow many more? \n\nAmerica: are you awake?, 6 Good thing we have the Republicans ready to offer their thoughts and prayers. That will really help the dead kids and their families., 6 Obviously liberals are to blame.  Liberal gun laws for example.  We need restrictive, conservative gun laws to protect our children.  , 6 The Well Regulated Militia once again has struck..., 6 Is it time yet to talk about gun control? No, TOO SOON, right? Time to talk about \"thoughts and prayers.\" What a gutless government we have. , 6 \"America and its gun laws are like watching a dear friend do drugs, insisting they can handle it.  Nobody knows what to say or do any longer.\" \u2013 Aminatta Forna, 6 Seventeen young lives cut down because congress wants to be sure the wackos who think they will need to fight the government someday won't include them when it starts.  , 6 Each and every one of the 17 families should sue the parents of this killer.\n\nAmerica has been awash in violent, vicious men since the 1960s. American has been awash in violent, vicious young men shooting up schools since the 1980s., 6 Lawmakers: Instead of tweeting out your latest thoughts and prayers for these murdered children why don't you do the courageous thing and actually fight for them so that they \u2013 unlike the countless numbers before them \u2013 didn't die in vain.  By continuing to turning a blind eye to the gun epidemic you are saying that the lives of innocent Americans mean less to you than the NRA checks that prop you up.  It's time to do something.  , 6 I'm waiting for a White House tweet on the Florida h.s. rampage and murders ... \"There are some very fine people on both sides of school shootings.\"  It would follow this week's \"I was told there are some very fine people on both sides of domestic violence.\"  , 6 A cultural shift would fix this.  Instead of guns being objects of fetishes, if adults pushed them out of public and personal consciousness, it wouldn\u2019t cross the minds of nuts to seek them out., 6 I 'm just so sick of crying over children I don't know, would never know, but who are all our babies in some sense, after all.  Is that all we can do now, just shed tears and go on?  Sadly, nothing will happen with our nutty gun \"regulations\".  If the Sandy Hook schoolchildren didn't soften those foul Congressional hearts, neither will this blatant bastardization of the Second Amendment.  AR-15!, 6 \"A former teacher told the Miami Herald that he believed the Mr Cruz was already on the school's radar.\"\n\n                  http://www.independent.co.uk/news\n\nWhy can unstable persons legally get guns ?  They can NOT in Israel., 6 So now our government officials will say some prayers and go ahead defending the sale of semiautomatic weapons., 6 Happy Valentine's Day America. \"And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.\" This is the love you've made, America, this is the love you made when you condoned Sandy Hook, when you condoned Columbine, when you condone the mass murders that take place every few days in America and you stand united with the murderers by DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AGAIN EXCEPT INCREASE GUN SALES EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS., 6 Curious, Not a single comment from the WH?  Time for the bleeding to stop. How many need to be sacrificed before this government gets involved?, 6 On the heels of the thoughts and prayers will be \"Gun Sale\" signs lining the rural roads this weekend. Among the beneficiaries of the terrorist weapon lobby is Florida's own Marco Rubio.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/04/opinion/thoughts-prayers-..., 6 President Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cNo child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d\nGun violence is not confined to American schools, 6 This is from a twitter post some years back by Dan Hodges, an English journalist:\n\n\u201c... Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate ... once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.\u201d\n\nHere we are in 2018 and it's not only bearable but commonplace for American children to be shot and killed in their schools.\n\nshame, shame, shame, 6 But of course, no gun control problem.\n\nWhat was that kid doing with a gun? Did he really needed it? The truth is he never used it to protect himself, but to kill others. That\u2019s why gun control is needed.\nOtherwise the NRA should be sent to trial for complicity in the murder of innocents. Giv\u2019em families some of your money NRA as you had theirs killed. , 6 Repeal the 2nd amendment., 6 Once again the NRA will absolve itself of any responsibility insisting that the 2nd amendment must be interpreted without limitation.\nWith 300 million arms on the loose, tragically it is too late!, 6 So very sorry for each family.\nSo sorry for the US as we begin the rounds of impotent elected official leadership.\nTruly, how do the gun lobby puppet politicians sleep at night?  Do they think of their own children, do they have souls?, 6 Cue the prayers.\nPass the buck on legislation., 6 Thoughts and prayers don't seem to be working., 6 Why are we brainwashed to believe there is not a way to buy back, recall, make illegal, military style weapons for civilians?\n\nTake some of that extra military budget and make it happen., 6 Oh my God! God help us all. RIP., 6 \"That's the price of freedom, folks!\"\nBill O'Reilly , 6 If you vote GOP, you got what you voted for.  Keep your thoughts and prayers - they aren't worth a dime.  , 6 Republican endgame: Soon we'll have a mass shooting every day, and it will never be \"the appropriate time\" to talk about gun control. , 6 \"Prayers and condolences.\" Pretty useless at this point. , 6 Why are people still shocked. It's become commonplace. And the just another opportunity for republicans to tweet about \"prayers\" blah blah blah and take no other action.  , 6 If the faculty and students were armed this would not happen.\nSo says the NRA and the Trumpeteers.\nFunny how we do the same thing over and over again and expect different results.\nInsanity.  Sad.  Bigly.  , 6 Hello from the UK. I expect more hand wringing, sympathy for the victims, seeking solace in God and the perennial guilty part: he is a mad man, or mentally ill etc. You have too many guns! It has NOTHING to do with a 200 year old Constitution (Do not worry. Great Britain is not going to try and recover the Colonies). No. Guns kill people. It is what they were designed to do in the 15th century, and nothing has changed since. So get a grip and ban the bloody things!, 6 The MOCs thoughts and prayers are with the families. That\u2019s the best we can do. Sorry..., 6 Vote out legislators who support the NRA! This needless slaughter will not end until Congress acts for the public and not the gun lobby!, 6 It is time.  Potus prayers, how to say you are helping without really doing anything, just won't cut it.  It is all a non event for the NRA and White House. , 6 Time for our well regulated militias to defend America against assault rifles., 6 Logic to come....if only every teacher and student had a gun!, 6 Nothing will change. Thoughts and prayers! The most empty words in the universe. Except for the loved ones of the victims, we will soon forget and go on with our lives. We will elect the same craven politicians again and again. The NRA and the politicians in its thrall have so much blood on their hands. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing matters. Welcome to the world of Homo sapiens americanus., 6 (expletive deleted) the prayers & condolences.   (note: Trump doesn't pray anyway).   DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ACCESS TO AR15s and \"countless ammo\"., 6 Lather, Rinse, Repeat, 6 \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible day for us.\u201d\n\nWe live in a horrible country that is run by the gun lobby and the NRA. , 6 OK, here comes Congress again. Thoughts and prayers. Believe me, no one wants to hear their thoughts and prayers. Try opening your ears and listen to the kids who were in the 18 schools that have had shootings since only January 1 of this year. Try listening to the prayers of the families who can no longer speak to their loved ones. Another 17 voices silenced. If our government has nothing constructive to add, then please don't use another tragedy to gain face time. Instead, tell all these families how hard you have worked to prevent mass shootings from ever happening. You probably have nothing to say, and that says everything. , 6 17. That is the same number of dead victims as the Dunblane school massacre in Scotland in 1996. Over there that massacre led to greatly restricted private ownership of firearms in Great Britain. Over here? Nothing will change., 6 President Trump has offered his thoughts and prayers. \n\nHe does not have an original thought worth knowing and he doesn't know how to pray. No, what he does know how to do is sleep with porn stars, submit to bribery from a hostile nation, and spearhead a campaign of ethnic cleansing. \n\nPresident Trump is a clear and present danger to our country. , 6 It will never ever end. It will only get worse. We saw it here at Volumbine, but nothing was done. As long as their are Senators, Presidents, Paul Ryan congressmen that are FOR SALE to the NRA it will continue!!\nGod! Look at Americas\u2019s love for violent movies in theaters, on Netflix, on Amazon, on HBO, etc., etc., etc.!!\nSo many of us gathered in our local churches the night of the Columbine Massacre. We hoped a religious people the Americans claim to be would rise up with one voice and say no to the NRA!\nBut..., 6 Australia banned guns as has most of the civilized world.  Why can't we, the ostensible leader of the free world?  Guns have no place in a modern society.  They should be made illegal, confiscated and destroyed., 6 Have we all had enough yet?, 6 The 7th American Mass Shooting this month.\nThe 29th American Mass Shooting this year - in just 7 weeks.\nhttp://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting\nThey only make big news if records get broken or it happens in a school.\nFace it. This is who we are.\nhttps://emcphd.wordpress.com, 6 Prayers and condolences are obviously doing nothing to slow down the pace of the slaughter. Are Republicans the only ones to have not realized this yet?, 6 Thoughts and prayers.   But hey, it could have happened if someone ran amok with a screwdriver so no need for tighter gun regulations!, 6 \"There really are no words.\" Really????? How about no guns???? How about this country starts to REALLY care about its children??? That would be an excellent start., 6 Why why do we as a country give our power away and allow the person holding the gun the power to kill others?, 6 So many sacrificed on the altar of the Second Amendment. The uniquely American dirge known as \u201cThoughts and Prayers,\u201d led by the NRA\u2019s chief disciple, President Trump, jars on the ear as well as in the soul. When will we ever learn?, 6 This story gives me such pain. How absurd the other headlines of the day are things like 'Trump lawyer pays off porn star\". Is there some way that our government (and media) can effectively mitigate our 'mass shooting in schools' problem and stop elevating the sexual scandals of the people we have elected as top news?, 6 Based on the value we put on their lives, children are NOT our future. We clearly have too many and need to purge a few every month or so.\n\nGuess what, El Presidente? Children, teachers and everyone else except apparently white Republican men feel pretty unsafe in America. Additional tip - it's not illegal immigrants or ISIS we're scared of.\n\nI'm not expecting that to change any time soon. , 6 and where was Trump at Mar Lago with his gun to protect these kids?, 6 I simply accept understand why we don\u2019t rise up as a society and do something about this! Obviously the less guns, the less chance of this happening. We all know this! Data supports this! It\u2019s common sense! Why can\u2019t our leaders understand this!?!?, 6 Thoughts and prayers, etc. etc. , 6 Money and Politics.  The source of so much evil in this country.  , 6 We need disable policy, not enabling prayer. , 6 There are too many angry and unhappy people out there.  This is never gonna end.  Congress, get your act together., 6 Hi lawmakers. Below is some interesting reading while you kick back on your 20th \"recess\" of the year:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shootings_in_the_United_States\n\nDid it feel like the scrolling never ended after passing up the 1970's? Depressing, to say the least. And, as many have pointed out here, these are KIDS! Clearly you fail horribly in your most basic duty: protecting American lives. Shameful., 6 There is something seriously wrong with this country if a 19 year-old is able to get his hands on an AR-15.\n\nNYT, I knew that the suspect was white after reading the first three paragraphs. Why? If it was any other race, he would be referred to as a terrorist, not as a shooter or a gunman. Because a shooter and a gunman is attributing a job or career to the person while terrorist is just plainly making it clear that the suspect is not white.\n\nLet us do each other a favor and remove the terms shooter or gunman from the journalistic vocabulary. This man is a terrorist. He is a domestic terrorist. That\u2019s all there is to be said about him. No shooter, no gunman. He is a terrorist. , 6 Thoughts and prayers are nice. Gun reform would be nicer., 6 THIS is to all those who vote GOP and, especially, NRA Members  :\n  Do NOT dare spew about thoughts and prayers for The Victims.  YOU are responsible for THIS, and every other GUN murder in this Country. Don't deny, lie, and blame. YOU OWN THIS.  Your precious Second Amendment is not worth the LIFE of one single Child.  I am calling on WOMEN, especially, to take a VOW to end this stain, this nightmare, this sickness on our Land.\nOnly we can stop This, and we can do it soon.  Make your voice heard, and especially make YOUR VOTE count.  Just say no to GUN MURDER.  Refuse to vote for ANY GOP Candidate, and explain why.  They will eventually understand and capitulate, or they will be GONE.  Thank you., 6 Remember when Trump said \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now\" in his inaugural address? Was he talking about the wonderful world that his friends in the NRA have created? I guess not., 6 A bad guy is an angry good guy with a gun. We are an angry nation with easy access to guns. We need to address our toxic politics, our fake news, our economic inequality and our overwhelming dependance on social media which make us angry. Guns are the means, but anger is the cause., 6 Let us be clear to our politicians.  Our children are dying.  Do your job or your time is up, in every election cycle, regardless of party affiliation.  Pass the buck, and we will pass you up., 6 As an Australian, I just by don't know what to say.  There are way too many similar murders, I have become a little numb to it I think.  I am heartbroken for the parents of these children., 6 What about the recent opinion column telling us more guns make us safer? Florida is a Stand Your Ground state. Should the teachers be carrying, should the students, is this what the NYT would like us to consider today?, 6 These atrocities are a reflection of a sick society. A culture that's cultured  with violence and meanness. Today's youth are immersed in video  games where killing is the goal. Politicians talk about the right to bear arms while stuffing their coffers with NRA dollars. A President spewing hateful remarks on a daily basis creating division like we've never seen. Sadly this country is in decline imo and all the money in the world won't save it., 6 No one needs an AR-15 assault rifle - not for hunting, not for protection, not for any reason. ENOUGH., 6 Already, our \"leaders\" line up with prayers and condolences, remaining unwilling to hear the voices of the people demanding the difficult changes needing to be made in combatting the gun cult., 6 Not the guns...the people are the problem. Where they don't have access to guns, the perps attack with knives.  , 6 Dear republicans in Congress, \n\nPlease say the following: \n\n\u201cNow\u2019s not the time to talk about gun control policies. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, we\u2019ll give you money and won\u2019t publicly oppose you in the next primary.  Deal?\n\n-NRA  , 6 They\u2019ll (Trump and co) say a lot of things and do absolutely nothing.  , 6 \u201cThoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019d at least be less insulting if they just were honest: \u201cCollateral damage for macho fantasies.\u201d, 6 How much innocent blood must be shed to support the firearm industry and it's puppet, the NRA?  As far as our current leaders are concerned, there is no limit.  , 6 Republican party owns this tragedy. And I write this as a voting Republican., 6 And Florida's Governor champions guns everywhere.\nAll it means is that more innocent lives were snuffed out.\nAnd this follows the Pulse Nightclub mass shooting in Florida, which was then the nation's worst gun massacre.\nWill they never learn?, 6 They had the bad luck not to be killed by an illegal immigrant so in the eyes of our esteemed president and much of Congress their deaths are of no matter.\n\nIsn't it odd that those who oppose abortion saying all human life has value seem to devalue the lives of those killed by Americans., 6 There have been 18 school shootings in 2018.  No other country in the free world has this record of slaughter.  \n\nA ban on assault rifles NOW.  Just like you, I completely reject the Court's interpretation of the Second Amendment.  Get guns out of America!!\n\nDeepest condolences to the families on the loss of their loved ones. \n\n I see no end to this madness without a RADICAL change to our gun laws. The NRA and the Republican party must be endlessly condemned., 6 As a first step, you need a Democratic Congress and Presidency. The Republicans have already sold their soul to the NRA on this issue. Anyone who votes Republican, or even for a third party, is voting to keep the status quo with guns., 6 And our peerless leader does nothing but tweet ineffectual nonsense about prayers and condolences.  Same ole same ole., 6 Another day of \"our thought and prayers ....\", 6 Unbelievable, but unfortunately all too real in the only developed country with such lax gun laws.\n\nUnfortunately, we are going to hear a lot more \u201cthey are in our prayers\u201d from the NRA and no real solutions.  I almost have come to believe that these unlimited weapon freedom individuals believe that these young souls must be \u2018sacrificed\u2019 for a ridiculous gun freedom philosophy.  They nearly worship firearms in the same way Christians worship God, and like Christian philosophy there is a sacrificial theme: all the people who died in the flood of Noah, Columbine, Abraham\u2019s son, Virginia Tech, Jesus on the Cross, Sandy Hook, etc. \n\nSickening., 6 A recent white paper was published by ATF and effectively written by the gun lobby endorsing easier access to silencers, AR 15 and AK 47 \u2018sport riflies\u2019 and it is being pushed by Trump and Scott.  They should have no comment mass shootings as they doing everything possible to encourage the availability of weapons that are at the heart of these massacres.   Gov Scott going to scene for what? Thoughts and prayers... just stay, shut up and stay out of the way.  Despite 85% of Americans calling for sensible gun control, nothing happens. Why, The GOP is bought and paid for by NRA with just 3 mm members and a little Russian finances they have congress locked up.  Proof we are no longer a democracy of \u2018we the people.\u2019 , 6 Since the majority of Americans want reasonable gun restrictions, let's call this massacre, and the future ones just waiting to happen, Republican mass shootings., 6 More thoughts and prayers?  How about some action in getting these murderous weapons off the streets?, 6 This is becoming the norm., 6 \"This happens nowhere else other than the United States of America \u2014 this epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cIt only happens here not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.\"\n\n\"As a parent it scares me to death that this body doesn't take seriously the safety of my children, and it seems like a lot of parents in South Florida are going to be asking that same question later today,\u201d he said.\n---\nRepeat this to EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL from dog catcher to POTUS!, 6 Thoughts and prayers don't save lives., 6 Trump boasted that he was the first President since Reagan to speak at the NRA annual meeting.  No matter how many children die, he sends prayers and condolences and does nothing., 6 People please it's far too early to talk about gun control! We're still waiting for the time to be ripe to talk about it from the Columbine tragedy, so maybe we can talk about this one in a few decades. Gosh how insensitive. \n\nThoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers don't do anything thoughts and prayers it's too early thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers, 6 President, Congress: \n\nSpouting \"prayers and condolences\" once again, is nothing but shallow, condescending, empty rhetoric. Instead, be true leaders this time and actually do something. So how about it? You can at least try can't you? Or are you admitting that America is too far gone, too broken to fix?, 6 Right now the NRA is sending out a mass email to their members telling them that this shooting will lead to politicians taking their guns away and you better go out and buy a bunch right now. And their members will do just that. Happens after every school shooting. As far as the NRA is concerned, dead kids are just a marketing opportunity for the gun industry., 6 American carnage. For real.\nHow come the 2nd Amendment evangelists can take away our rights to not be shot in school? What about our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? , 6 Guns are still doing what they are designed, sold and bought to do:  kill the living of all species.  There are now over 350 MILLION privately owned firearms in the U.S., 6 Or perhaps we can simply abolish the 2nd amendment. I'd trade that privilege for less dead children any day. , 6 The problem has reached extreme, tragic proportions.  Yet, even when the shock is at its worse, we hear voices saying (effectively), \"Now let's not be too extreme in our reactions, let's not act too quickly, let's not get drastic, let's not blame guns, let's not think bad things about gun sales and heaven forbid, let's not ban assault weapons, it isn't kind to weapons makers. Let's not think laws can help this situation, oh, heavens no, let's not blame Congress or the NRA, let's wait til all the grief is over before we think about these things.\"  But by that time there is another school shooting. I say get angry, have moral outrage at the voice inside of you, inside of me or in anyone else that counsels complacency and cowers before the NRA and gun manufacturers., 6 More prayers and condolences.  When will this country do the right thing and actually take action?  As much as I support gun owners for sporting purposes and even defense, semi-automatics should be banned once again.   To those who say perpetrators will get the guns on the black market simply ask why automatic weapons are not used in these mass murders.  The reason?  they were banned years ago.  End of story.  Gun control does work.  Do it.  Do it now ban semi automatics and large clip sizes.  , 6 I am saddened by yet another mass murder, and yet another one in a school.  During the Clinton administration, Congress acted to ban the manufacture of assault weapons, but the ban expired after 10 years.  Assault weapons are not sport weapons. Our history of violence shows that they are murder weapons used repeatedly in recent years to commit mass murder.  This time one person killed 17. In Las Vegas, one person killed 59. In Orlando, one person killed 49. In San Bernardino, two people killed 14 and wounded 22.  And these are just samples of recent instances.  The second amendment gives our citizens the right to bear arms.  The assault rifle law withstood constitutional challenges because one can arm themselves without resorting to assault rifles.  It is time to move to stop the carnage by legislating against assault rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks, and other accessories that enhance the lethal capability of assault rifles. New legislation cannot end the carnage because of the large number of assault rifles already in circulation. But it will stop sales of new attack rifles, and diminish their spread.  No doubt, we will hear again that \"now is not the right time to talk legislation, because we are reacting to the incident.\"  Of course it is the right time to legislate.   We have lived through these events frequently, and fully comprehend the issues. Moreover, history has repeatedly shown that no legislation takes place between massacres. , 6 What we have in the United States is an unprecedented \"freedom and identity\" rebellion/crisis boiling up from troubled youth. \n\nYou can thank the internet for ALL of that! \n\nNow, every adolescent emotion is exponentially exploited by a following of people who create the social platform to validate emotion. \n\nThe consequences like today will be more and forthcoming. \n\nI blame the helicopter parents.     , 6 I'll be in Italy soon and am already thinking of how to answer the inevitable question, asked soberly and with true concern: Why do Americans let everyone have guns, with no control?, 6 It happened again today. I was sitting at work, very busy at what I do, and the news flash broke. There was a horrible shooting with a semi-automatic weapon, and there were multiple casualties. Horror had struck again.\n\nWhat was different this time was that my daughter lives 2 to 3 miles from there.\n\nI immediately texted her to make sure she was okay. There was no reason for her to be anywhere near that school, but I am 1500 miles away, and you never really know.\n\nShe was fine...and I was so relieved.\n\nMy daughter is 28...she had no reason to be near that school...and yet I was beyond anxious. I cannot even begin to understand the anxiety of parents whose children were in that school.\n\nWhere...and how...does this all end? When is enough going to be enough? How many times are we Americans going to go through this? More importantly, how many times are we going to tolerate this?\n\nToday is Valentine's Day. It is a day that has been institutionalized by thinking of those you love, and showing them how you feel. There are families that loved their loved ones today. They sent them to school on a Wednesday, and they thought they would celebrate those feelings. Now they will have to deal with making funeral arrangements.\n\nPlease...PLEASE...make this the last time. Demand change. Speak out locally. Work to make small changes. I never want to worry about my daughter this way again. No American parent should ever have to worry about their child in this way., 6 It's time to take on the NRA.  It's actually a weak and vulnerable organization.  Among gun owners in this country, only a fraction are NRA members, and among NRA members, only a portion are of the rapid variety.  Therefore, isolating this fringe element and depriving it of support would not be difficult.  In order to do that, though, we need to respect the rights of responsible gun owners who have nothing to do with this fringe group.  Painting all gun owners as equivalent to NRA members is inaccurate and disrespectful.  Instead, we must acknowledge and respect responsible gun owners and seek their support in eliminating the NRA as an influential presence.  The lives of our kids depends on it.  , 6 Sadly, once again, we witness result of inability of US institutions and policy makers to respond to crisis., 6 Isn't it ironic that the guns didn't stop the government from slipping toward authoritarianism? The president appoints his own family members in the White House? No problem. The cabinet member flies first-class all the time? No problem. The press secretary says people shouldn't question a four-star general? No problem. The president calls for a military parade? No problem. That gun ownership can protect democracy is like eating ice cream can prevent hypothermia. , 6 Readers are now inundating this column with comments attributing the killing to the availability of guns. In fact, there has been a significant increase in school shootings while the percentage of households with guns has remained constant or even declined. European nations that have a third of our gun ownership have gun homicide rates that are a tenth or less of ours. The fault, dear readers, is not only in our guns but in ourselves., 6 I just returned from Florida on airplanes. I had to remove clothing, have my bags inspected and my body scanned so that I carried nothing of destruction.  why? So that everyone traveling by air is safe. We have no other choice that will work. Guns are not allowed because where there are no guns, everyone is safe from being shot.  Why are schools and school children and people in general exempt from such safety once they leave the plane? Because somebody will not make a buck from the sale of guns. Since we can't scan and inspect everyone as they move about in society, we must remove the guns - period. What other choice do we have that will work?, 6 I wasn't afraid to go to school when I was 16.  Please make this stop.  Take these guns out of the hands of ANYONE who is not serving our country in the armed forces or law enforcement., 6 If he obtained his gun legally the background checks that are being performed need to be improved.   Nobody who looked at his social media postings would have approved giving him a gun permit.\nParents need to take more responsibility also.  I can't imagine that I could have purchased and hidden an assault rifle in my house while growing up without my parents knowing about it.  , 6 Michael I Agree when will basic morality win out? Its a sad day period! I am and have been puzzled for many years now as to why the airports can have metal detectors protecting mostly adults, However most schools do not have the same type of protection! remember this was not in the urban district this was in a more affluent community lets fix the problem no matter where it is PLEASE!!, 6 Again, again, our deepest condolences. There is no way to express how horrified and profoundly saddened we are. There is no way to imagine ourselves in the place of the other students, the parents, relatives, friends. \n\nWe know how to stop almost all of these events, but we just don't do it. \n\nIt's impossible for me not to be angry once again at those who profit from what causes these tragedies. Not only here, but around the world, this has become the definition of what the U.S.A. is. \n\nI can't look at even the photo of the father and daughter without tears coming to my eyes. My sympathy also for those who have to see and deal with the rest., 6 The U.S. has made its' choice, and that choice says that the NRA's \"grading system\" which determines the fealty of members of Congress to the gun lobby matters much more than the lives of innocent victims. The blood on their hands does not affect their lives of ease., 6 It's reassuring to know that our spineless \"leaders\" will offer \"Thoughts and Prayers\" once again.  I'm one of many men who hope that Steve Bannon is correct, and women are about to upend the Patriarchy.  , 6 I have been active in the gun violence prevention movement for almost 4 years now, and spent the day yesterday at our state capitol, advocating for a bill that will expand the definition of domestic abusers that are banned from owning guns to include stalkers and intimate dating partners. While it may seem like a minuscule movement towards gun sense laws, this work takes an enormous amount of time, energy, and focus by an army of grassroots volunteers. The solution to gun violence in this country will come many angles and only through citizen action. So cry, hug your kids, then get mad and call your elected officials to let them know you are taking action on this issue - if they don't support GVP, find a new candidate to vote for., 6 We can say with 100% certainty that the pro-gun group in Washington and with the NRA will state that \"this is not the right time to discuss gun control. This is a time for grieving.\" It is a dodge that always works. Those who are in a position need to forcefully push back and not just  ask when but even go so far as to set a time and a date and a location.  \n\nAnd at that time, bring in the media. Let's reveal who has no courage to appear before the cameras and actually begin a conversation leading to a meaningful debate. The same old excuse and alibi is worn out. If something isn't done to force the conversation, we'll just see more of our children mowed down.    , 6 The entire country of Japan had only 6 deaths by gun in 2014. It is legal to buy guns there, but there are strict rules and regulations. Sadly, our legislators are so afraid of the gun lobby that they wouldn't even think of implementing some common sense rules to help us avoid tragedies like today's., 6 We all know that this event will have exactly zero impact on gun policy in this country. Probably on mental health policy, too\u2014in fact, for the love of god, let us not have either universal health care, including mental health, or sane gun control laws. That would just be completely unwarranted. Instead, let us give healthcare to guns, and make sure every gun has its own gun. To be safe., 6 The new normal. I don\u2019t even blink an eye anymore with these stories. I\u2019ve hardened my heart. Until the tRump Reign is over & we\u2019ve regained our senses, this is how it is. I just hope it doesn\u2019t affect my family, friends or me. It\u2019s the only to psychologically deal with it. I have no power to change it, nor do you. , 6 Is there any possibility that we're ready to do something tangible about school violence other than pay lip service to the horror of it all? Isn\u2019t it time to do something other than pray . . . for the victims . . . and the survivors . . . and even the gunman and his family?\n\nI think it's time Congress did something proactive: agree to pass some meaty legislation that might at least lower the number of school-shooting victims, without concern about how it will affect their next election or their pocketbooks. No more eloquent, empty speeches to a nation becoming increasing deaf to excuses about how guns don\u2019t kill people and why 2nd Amendment rights cannot be violated are wanted or needed.\n\nBringing in counselors to help young people work through a trauma they should never have to be witness to is a poor substitute for doing something of substance to prevent it. Providing grief counseling for students who lost friends and teachers and siblings and for parents who lost children and for spouses of adult victims is little consolation for unnatural deaths that might have been prevented.\n\nThis deadly epidemic seems pretty much limited to this nation. When Australians saw evidence of the menace seeding itself there, they took measures to stop it. Isn\u2019t it time to seek AND heed their advice on how to solve this problem? \n\nWhy bother arguing about abortion until we've taken measures to keep the kids we already have alive?\n\nWell?, 6 The Republicans so admire the society of Afghanistan: no paved roads, no street lights, no infrastructure. But everyone has access to guns. \n\nThey have succeeded in making America as great as Afghanistan.\n\nThink of the children., 6 Stoneman Douglas should have seen this coming.  Every middle and high school in the U.S. should immediately send out a letter to students, parents, teachers, administrators and other staff, asking if there might be some individual (unstable, or with a strong interest in guns, for example) who may pose a danger to that school.  If a name comes up (especially numerous times), the school and law enforcement should make an effort to reach out to that student, or, at a minimum, monitor his/her social media postings.  Cruz was well-known to his fellow students and, probably, school employees.  This action might very well have prevented this tragedy.  AND, we should ban assault weapons!, 6 These shootings are happening in schools all over the country. Why do so many Americans believe that picking up a gun is the solution to a problem? Who is it that is teaching teenagers to kill one another? Our society is sending the wrong messages to our children through the media, through anyone who has the power to get to our children through our instant technological world.\n\nThere is just so much our religious institutions can do to instill proper values in children. There is just so much our mental health organization can do as well.\n\nOur only hope is a majority vote from Congress that will ban children (and most adults as well) from purchasing a gun. Great Britain, Scotland, Austrailia and Japan, for example, are working toward a zero tolerance for owning a gun or even a knife. America's homicide rate is 25 times higher than these countries.\n\nWhy do civilians need to have the right to bear arms? Really? We need to change public opinion about this immediately. The right national campaign run by educated, highly motivated individuals determined to change public opinion against bearing arms could bring about change very quickly. I believe Americans WILL listen to an anti-weapons message if presented intelligently to the American public., 6 How many American men, women and children have to die before the US does something about it's gun problem?  I live in New Zealand half of the year and people here have guns and generally use them responsibly for hunting.  But they have very thorough background checks and rules requiring ownership, usage and storage of guns.  \n\nNo other country in the civilized world has as many gun deaths as the US.  When will the public tell its representatives to stop listening to the NRA and start doing something about the problem.\n\nI weep for my country., 6 As 19 year old has gun .It seems that explosive arms/rifles are easy to access to anybody.This is not the first incident of gun violence . We see so many gun violence/homicide happening almost everyday. How come Government still not taking any steps to make stringent laws for Gun . When country has law enforcement why an ordinary person needs gun. Here is the same question how that 19 year old has easily access of gun ? If Government not taking any steps towards gun violence than the people of USA need to appeal and demand the Government to abolish the gun violence and urge for safety and protection of people., 6 Thoughts and condolences and our children and teachers should feel safe are fine words but what are you going to do to make it happen Mr President.  These words have become the most offensive words a politician can utter after gun violence.  \n\nI'm starting to wonder if these shootings were happening in private schools where the children of the rich and powerful actually go if something would be done about our gun violence.  I think because gun violence seldom touches the lives of the people who can do something about it they have no incentive to fix the problem.  The blood of these gun victims lie directly on our politicians hands., 6 More facts become evident as each hour passes since this senseless tragedy.Hundreds of unanswered questions still remain.Weeks will pass before the complete picture emerges.Let's postpone judgments/analysis until we get the complete picture., 6 How many more of these heinous mass shootings must our citizenry endure in order to protect the status quo of the NRA?  The frequency of these events are picking up and will continue to pick up more and more unless something meaningful is done.  We need to do what Australia did.  Offer a gun surrender amnesty, even a buy back for legal fire arms.  No normal American needs an AR-15 or an AK-47., 6 I am far too often reminded of a Dan Hodges tweet:  \"In retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.\"\n\nIt's now been five years since Sandy Hook.  Has anything changed?  Yes, according to \"60 Minutes,\" who reported on a bill quietly making its way through Congress that would basically allow concealed weapons nation-wide whether a state allowed it or not.  Will it make people safer?  Maybe, maybe not.  But what does need to change is our attitude towards guns and gun violence.  \"Thoughts and prayers\" are merely platitudes that get lathered, rinsed and repeated far too often.\n\nSeventeen people, students and adults, will not be around a dinner table this evening.  Maybe everyone else who is can have deep-felt conversations about guns and gun violence in this country.  \n\nSomething has to change.  We are better than this., 6 Once every family in the nation has been personally touched by gun violence, then perhaps change in gun laws may come.  We can't be far from that goal now.  Personal experience we can hope will at least be a teacher for some about what we must collectively do to end this kind of news story for good., 6 How can we possibly stand idly by as these actions keep happening? This is just another example of the trend of domestic terrorism in schools. We have become accustomed to these acts of terror, and the only question we can ask is \"when will it happen again?\" Until we stand up and take action, American students will live in fear that one day, it may be them, and parents will fear for their children's lives. Yes, the president is right. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. But how are the survivors of this horrific event ever supposed to feel safe going to school? How will their parents ever feel comfortable and safe sending their children to school? I know that I would feel unsafe going to school, knowing that AR-15s and other obviously unnecessary machines of death are so easily accessible. , 6 I will bet anything that the shooter is someone with a mental health problem who is profoundly disconnected from his or any community. The discussion will be about gun laws (the US' unwillingness to regulate ownership is insane, but not likely to change), and mental health (the US health system is dysfunctional, but unlikely to change). \n\nWhat no one will be talking about is how each of us can actually reduce the risks at a local level by connecting 'difficult' people and their communities.\nIndividual action is needed and entirely possible. Some practical steps everyone can take just by being mindful: \n\nMake an effort to talk to those who appear friendless, don't ooze charm and seem lonely and angry. They may not seem like appealing friends, but often reveal themselves as people of deep feeling, big hearts, loyalty and interesting stories. If they have mental health issues, your encouragement or support may prompt them to seek help. \n\nDiscourage your kids from engaging only in cliques. Foster greater opportunities for people to mix and mingle, but don't be tokenistic or tactless. \n\nDon't teach kids to look down on other people.\n\nTry and see the whole person and find the best thing about them that you can love. Teach your children that skill. \n\nGive people second chances. \n\nBefore you dismiss or judge someone, find out more about them and put yourself in their shoes. \n\nI bet it would do a lot more good than more pointless op eds about gun control or health programs. , 6 President Trump is right that no child or parent should have to go through this sort of tragedy.  So, Mr. President, what do you plan on doing to try to lessen the chance that this happens again in the (very near) future?  Thoughts and prayers are clearly not enough., 6 I don't know how, but this has got to stop.  Can our government leaders help get us out of this carnage that's become commonplace?, 6 Gun stocks up after Las Vegas shooting: Shares of Sturm Ruger (RGR) were up 4%, American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the company formerly known known as Smith & Wesson, up over 3%.  Olin (OLN), which owns the Winchester brand of ammunition, rose 6% to an all-time high.\nHow many Congressmen own these stocks?   , 6 In the eight weeks since 2018 began, there have been seven school shootings\u2014yes, nearly a shooting a week. Six other schools have had to lock-down and shelter-in-place while rows of anxious parents wait for texts from their children.\n\nWhile the problems that drive troubled people to break are many, the solution in each was the same, a gun. And, in many cases, a gun designed for the battlefield. These aren't hardened gangsters trading illegal weapons, they're children who have easy access to deadly firearms.\n\n\"Responsible\" gun owners who do not keep their guns under lock and key are guilty. Those who weaken the ability of background checks and work to keep loopholes open are guilty. Those who encourage high-capacity mods are guilty. Those who undermine access to mental and physical health services are guilty. Those who don't support a national registration are guilty. And those politicians who accept millions from the gun industry, like Marco Rubio, to keep the status quo in place are guilty. \n\nEqually as guilty are the rest of us (myself included) who watch this carnage unfold again and again and only speak out when \"it happens again.\" That 2018 has passed and six of the seven school shootings flies under the radar news-wise makes me sick. This won't be a \"wake-up call\" if we keep hitting the snooze button., 6 These shootings will continue - until the gun laws are changed. And that will be when?  Ask the GOP., 6 I will speak as someone who used to work in the Firearms Manufacturing Industry, more specifically, a company that manufactured and sold AR-15 Type rifles.   I hope I can educate a number of people on the weapon, its history, and changes in our culture surrounding the rifle.\n\nThe AR-15 is a derivative of the M16 Rifle, that is the standard, BUT they are highly difficult and HIGHLY ILLEGAL to convert to full auto.\n\nThe first commercial version was introduced in the late 1960's and 1970's as the Colt SP1 and Colt Sporter, these were made up of surplus parts leftover from the Vietnam War.  The AR-15 has been on the civilian commercial market since the 1960's.  \n\nYes, we have had mass shootings back then, and don't start bringing up specifics to say it was bad back then because it wasn't as bad as it is now.  The one difference VIOLENT KILLING CULTURE.\n\nVideo games such as Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto only came about in the 1990's, when Mass shootings were more prolific and had numerous casualties.  As I have seen them, these video games get more bloody, more violent, more realistic, and more numbing to gore as time goes on.  \n\nI will bet, just like the Newtown school shooter, this shooter in Florida played and worshiped these video games, and thus, the weapons used in them.  They receive a false sense of reality and commit these horrors when they are angered.\n\nIn conclusion, shouldn't we look at the culture in Video games our students are exposed to??, 6 On 20 April, 1999, it was an ordinary, and nice spring day, in Colorado. I worked at the University of Colorado, at the time. And Columbine is about 30 or so miles to the south. I went to eat lunch, at he normal time, and saw the coverage of a mass shooting. Two kids killed their peers, and each other. It was emotional. Enough so, that, like many Coloradans, I visited site. A memorial that seemed to span a acre. Today, a memorial stands it its place. Columbine High School was modified to eliminate the scene of the shooting. For weeks the state mourned, and we remember this event every year.\n\nSince then there have been many more \"Columbines\", more heartaches, more mourning, more questioning when politicians will do something. More wondering how people got the guns to inflict the most damage. And, witness one more horrifying event after another. Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Aurora, Orlando, Fort Hood, and a myriad of others. Then, recent cop killings Denver, Castle Rock, Thornton, Colorado Springs, Westerville, Ohio and Chicago; these in the last 7 weeks.\n\nOne would think, that after several people getting mowed down that we would see an attempt to put an end to this. But, these horrors continue in the name of 2nd amendment rights. When will politicians grow a back bone and vote against the NRA?\n\nSo, again, as a number times before, my prayers and sympathy goes out the the families whose children died today; needless, in our ever sick and broken down society. , 6 There are two words in the 2nd Amendment we should start focusing on - \u201cwell regulated\u201d. The way things are now the \u201cmilitia\u201d of the people certainly is not. As of this writing 17 are dead today when all they did was go to school. Have we no shame?, 6 The Guardian ran an article this week about the Remington gun company that is going out of business due to poor sales.\n\n\u201cThey call it the Trump slump,\u201d said Robert Spitzer, a professor at the State University of New York at Cortland and the author of five books on guns.\n\u201cGun sales have become politicized to a great degree,\u201d he said. \u201cGun purchases recently have been made not just because someone wants a new product but to make a statement; not just because of fears that there might be tighter regulation but also to make a statement against Obama.\u201d\n\n\"After a golden era of sales under Barack Obama, America\u2019s gun manufacturers are in trouble. Sales have tumbled, leaving the companies with too much stock on their hands and falling revenues.\n\nIn December, American Outdoor Brands, the owner of Smith & Wesson, reported that its profits had fallen 90% year over year, from $32m to just $3.2m. Sales fell 36%. Last October, Sturm Ruger, the US\u2019s largest firearm manufacturer, announced its quarterly revenues had fallen 35%.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/remington-bankruptcy-gun...\n\nI found this confounding.  If it is true.\n\nHow sad for the students, families, staff and neighbours of this Florida school.  There is really nothing one can say., 6 In his inaugural address trump promised to stop the \"American carnage.\"  This is the real American carnage.  Children are being mowed down at school with military weapons.  Prayers aren't cutting it.  But after his response to the shooting in Las Vegas, we knew we'd never see anything substantive from this character.  \n\nAll there is to do now is restart the clock.  And wonder when Dems will sprout a backbone and talk about this problem,  , 6 Congress should vote tonight to ban all assault and military style rifles from sale and civilian possession. To do anything less would just result in more of this, week after week. , 6 I don't understand how legislators at the state and federal level tolerate these shootings.  They must sometimes think there but for the grace of God could be my children or grandchildren and yet the feckless group continue to put their re-election ahead of protecting Americans.  They are smart enough to keep guns out of some legislative buildings and out of courthouses because they know the dangers.  Yet they allow, even encourage more gun ownership and discourage any kind of gun licensing.  They protest it's the shooter not the gun, but they don't do anything about the shooters either.  They are cowards. I have thought that all of us should join the NRA and then take it over from the inside.  Most Americans believe in sensible gun licensing and control.  That majority needs to make the decisions on this, not the legislators who are afraid and not the NRA (separating it from its members) which is run by evil, craven people.\n\nThoughts and Prayers won't do it.  Thoughts and Prayers won't save the kids at the next school shooting. Gun legislation could.  Do you care about your kids, grandkids or your neighbors?  Will you do something? Can Americans protect themselves from guns?  Will they? , 6 Semiautomatic assault weapons should only be sold to the military.  Until we accomplish that, tragedies like this will continue.  It's so simple.  Yet it never changes.  This is at least the 12th school shooting in America since the new year began, only a month and a half ago!   \n\nBanning semiautomatics like the popular AR-15 won't stop school shootings altogether.  But fewer children - and adults - will die each time.  Can we start there?  Please.  BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS.  Sponsor buybacks - with lots of money behind them, and no questions asked - to remove some of the ones already in circulation.  What better place to start?  What does it take?!  How hardened to dead schoolchildren have we become?  \n\nWe won't even pass legislation to ban gun bumps that convert weapons into semiautomatics.  A gun industry is running this country.  That's a simple fact too.  I ask the people who profit from the sale of these weapons:  How do you sleep at night?  I ask the media who never seem to get around to identifying who these profiteers are:  When?  I want to know who they are.  There's an investigative report for you.   What's more important than that?  , 6 I have a firearms license (don't own a gun, don't want one but did want to understand how they work and not to be afraid of them). Once I completed the training and application process here in Canada, I was more gob-smacked than ever at what passes for policy in the US.\n\nOf course bad things will happen no matter the restrictions in place. But why make it so perplexingly easy? And clearly it is easy or we would not be so numb to these near daily tragedies.\n\nAt some point America collectively has made a choice that this loss of life is acceptable - no other developed nation suffers even a fraction of the staggering number of gun deaths as does the US. Can no lessons be considered from other countries' policies?\n\nYes, I understand your Second Amendment and the perplexing desire of some to defend it to their literal death as a sacrosanct right. \n\nBut don't your fellow citizens have an equal, and constitutionally protected, right not to be killed at school, at church or at work by some unhinged guy with an AR-15?, 6 This Carnage Will Not Stop\nUntil \"We the People\" stop i!\nWe the people must march in the streets!\nWe the people must, as a massive group let Congress know\nthat their inaction is intolerable!, 6 If it's too soon to talk about this shooting, can we talk about the one in Las Vegas?  Is it finally time to talk about Newtown?  Or the 18 other school shootings this year? Or the 9 school shootings in December 2017?  Pick a month, any month, and you can find a school shooting within the last year.  The last month with only one school shooting was February 2017.  \n\nIf you truly believe the problem is people, not guns, then ask your self why does this only happen in the United States?  A \"big\" hint is that our nation owns half of the civilian guns worldwide despite having only 5% of the world's population.  We have comparatively lax requirements for owning guns and terrible mental health care.  \n\nThe bottom line is that this will keep happening Every Single Month unless our elected Republican representatives do something about it.  I'd implore them to do the right thing and vote to limit the spread of semi-automatic weapons which can make anyone hellbent on carnage more powerful than John Rambo.  Maybe one day Republicans will decide that the over 290 school shootings since Sandy Hook are enough.  Until then, they're complicit in allowing this unabated slaughter.  Deplorable doesn't even begin to address the cowardice of the representatives who fear a lobbying organization more than they value the lives of schoolchildren., 6 Recently, when I went to a barber for a haircut, there was a young guy in there open carrying a pistol with an extended clip.  I have never seen anything like that before.  Why does someone need to take a loaded gun into a barbershop?  There were about 7 people in there, including the barber.  As I sat there waiting my turn, it occurred to me that he could easily kill me and everyone in there in a matter of seconds, flip the \u201copen\u201d sign to \u201cclosed\u201d, and walk out the door.  No one even know we were all dead until he was outside the state.  It\u2019s crazy this interpretation of the Second Amendment we've adopted.  Something needs to be done.  My heart goes out to these families., 6 I see two problems here. The first is the obviously absurd availability of guns, especially assault rifles, to anybody who wants them. The second is that high school in America is a social nightmare where students are merciless in their cliquish judgmentalism, shunning and bullying of anyone who's less than beautiful and cool--whatever that entails. What a difference compared to college, where I found that everyone can find friends and students are pretty much live and let live. What can you say--the little high-school brains are physically not developed yet., 6 Make it a requirement that each and every student come to school armed with a gun. It is obvious that a situation such as what happened at this Florida school would never have occurred if each and every student was able to protect him or her self., 6 This is the ideal the conservatives hold dear. Freedom without equality or justice. This is the world the Republicans want to create. , 6 I predict the response of Trump, Pence, and Sessions to this latest horror will be the usual NRA approved line that while their \"thoughts and prayers are with the families, this is not a time to talk about gun control.\"\n\nIt is never a time to talk about gun control for an administration as totally in the pocket of the NRA as is this one., 6 Easy access to opioids.  A crisis.  Thousands of deaths.  Congress and President are concerned and willing to take action to help prevent it.\n\nEasy access to guns.  A crisis.  Thousands of deaths.  Congress and President are unconcerned and unwilling to take action to help prevent it., 6 As an American, I feel sick and defeated. \n\nYet again mass murder, and there seems to be one almost every month and the response from people who could really make a difference is, ALWASY a variation of...\n\n\u201cMy prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,\u201d \n\nI do not know how these politicians sleep at night. , 6 Social contagion: Behavioral contagion is a type of social influence. It refers to the propensity for certain behavior exhibited by one person to be copied by others who are either in the vicinity of the original actor, or who have been exposed to media coverage describing the behavior of the original actor.\n\nTrump, the reality show president who\u2019s very presence embodies violence, misogyny, racism, bigotry, narcissism, psychopathy has been a destructive force upon the society. \n\n \"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters,\" President Donald Trump, 6 Thoughts and Prayers. The only thoughts in the GOP is what will the NRA want us to do. As for prayers they seem to fall on a silent and Indifferent god.  This constant senseless gun violence is preventable if we change out culture of Guns, Where there is a will there is a way. In GOP America there is no will., 6 You know what we do regularly in school? We have these mass shooting drills called ALICE training where we pretend, in different scenarios, that we are under attack by a gunman. We lockdown the classroom, students pile desks and furniture against the door, we thing if things we can throw, of how we can break windows, run away, use our phones to alert people. It\u2019s a mess. I am sick to my stomach. I do not want to go to school tomorrow. , 6 I have heard it stated many times that of the enormous amount of fierarms in America(one for every man, woman and child in the country)that only a relatively small percentage of citizens actually own these weapons. For the life of me then can anyone rationally explain how such a small group can continually control the government agenda which allows the carnage to continue?\n\nI do have a rather novel idea for your consideration.  Just maybe start electing those that are committed to actually doing something about it?, 6 I teach in an urban secondary school.\nSo many of the teens that come through our doors are hurting, depressed, afraid, lost, emotionally needy, and damaged.\n\nAnd what have we done to respond to these hurting, damaged human beings?\nWe've let a lot of profiteering \"reformers\" insist that schools drop everything to ignore the human beings in front of us and see them instead as test-takers to generate data the \"reformers\" can be paid to process.  That's all public schools have become: tests, data, tests, data, tests, data.  There's no time to tend to the damaged human beings.  \n\nTesting companies and ladder-climbing principals and clueless taxpayers distracted by the outdated \"greedy teachers unions\"  or the \"China is gonna beat us\" memes are robbing these kids of their very lives.\n\nNotice how these shootings are largely confined to public schools, where the testing and the greed has stripped all compassion for children away.  , 6 Why does this routinely happen in the USA and not anywhere else in civilized societies? We all know the answer. Why do Americans not really care? I don't have the answer to that., 6 Instead of the non stop sensational news coverage asking what prompted this individual to commit such an evil and horrific act, the public would be better served if news broadcasters had the guts to show every single member of Congress since 2004 when the ban on assault weapons was allowed to expire and the amount of blood money they have taken from the NRA to prevent sensible gun laws that the public overwhelmingly supports. They are all complicit in these crimes and should be called out for their cowardice and for perverting the true intent of the 2nd amendment. , 6 Let's be honest: The status, perks, and potential lobbying positions available to our elected officials keep their only line of resolve against gun violence on campuses stuck at \"thoughts and prayers...\". \n\nUntil a school shooter kills a GOP politician's child, nothing will change. Even then, I have my doubts. And statistics declare that the United States is on track for another school shooting by next week. It's inexcusable. , 6 It\u2019s been said before, though I can\u2019t recall where.  The crime scene photos from Sandy Hook being leaked and published would likely change public opinion on gun control overnight.  No one wants to see them but perhaps everyone should. What a sad and cruel place we\u2019ve come to.  , 6 Wasn't just a few days ago that two police officers were shot and killed, and just yesterday, a third? If the police organizations would stand with the families of every child who has been murdered with a gun, we might get somewhere with laws that would save lives of both police officers and schoolchildren. , 6 President Trump is absolutely right when he says, \"No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d Unfortunately, he is absolutely wrong to think \"prayers and condolences\" contribute in the least to accomplishing that goal. \n\nWe do react less over time to this mass violence. Sadly, that is a normal reaction, as events become common. Think back to the first suicide bombers in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. Then, a suicide bombing was considered a major \"event\", with all sorts of \"experts\" and specialists weighing in on the causes and prevention strategies. As time went on, we have now arrived at the point where \"suicide\" has been reduced in the media and the public consciousness merely to an adjective preceding \"bomber.\" , 6 I don't know the reasoning in other parts of the country, but here in the South many white people love the Second Amendment because they fear uprisings or attacks by \"the other\" (black people), and they believe a private arsenal in their homes will protect them. Talk to many conservative whites, and you will hear this motivation and defense for owning guns. \n\nPersonally, I want us all to just start talking to each other, to get to know one another better. PTA meetings, voter drives, town halls, churches, striking up conversations in the checkout line--wherever. Let's have more conversations between people of different races and ethnic backgrounds. \n\nMy comments here are only in regard to reasons for wanting to own a gun, not for committing mayhem at a school. This particular modern problem is far beyond my understanding or ability to find a solution for--except that it seems obvious no one needs an AR-15 for any purpose than mass murder., 6 We had planned on going stateside to Washington State for the first time in a few years to see some friends in a week or so.\n\nWe have been told to avoid driving down I-5 at night around Everett as well as that stretch of I-5 between Seattle and Tacoma due to frequent shootings. \n\nCan any American readers in Washington State confirm these rumours that we hear/fear in Canada?\n\nWe plan on only driving in the daylight.\n\nMany thanks to any replies., 6 Am I the only one who was struck by how the students had to be as concerned with proving to responding officers they weren't armed, as they were with fleeing to safety? The things we're doing to ensure 2nd amendment rights are absurd. High school kids have to flee school with their arms raised and walking like a lineup of convicts! It's just absurd., 6 I just wrote my Democratic Senator, Michael Bennet.\nIn 2013 he voted NO, along with our former Democratic Senator, Mark Udall, on a Diane Feinstein bill to ban Assault-Weapons.  They considered the bill went too far because 'it would ban some hunting rifles and even some shotguns' - REALLY?\n\nSenator Bennet offered his condemnation of the Pulse Nightclub shooting - done with a semi-automatic rifle and semi-automatic pistol.\nHypocrisy and inaction are not limited to Republicans.\n\nI told Senator Bennet I will not vote for him again unless he offers meaningful legislation to control access to guns - especially assault weapons.\n\n I urge you to do the same with your representatives., 6 Marco Rubio, senator from Florida, reportedly has gotten $3,303,000 from the NRA. I want to see a list of exactly how much all Senators and Representatives have gotten from the gun lobby., 6 So, is this to be another wasted opportunity to rid ourselves of this type of weapon? Will the authorities finally step up to the plate?  , 6 We have seen so many of these mass shootings in the last decade. I foolishy thought that Sandy Hook would finally st least lead to background checks-but even 20 first graders slaughtered by an AR-15 didn't move the members of Congress held prisoner by the NRA. I find it ironic that the present GOP seems willing to shred the Constitution but holds the 2nd Amendment as their Holy Grail, And the bloodbath continues apace-maybe this is, finally, the \"American Exceptionalism\" they so extol. , 6 This will come off to callous to some and I would never own a gun nor kill an animal but it\u2019s getting to the point where I just wait for the next news cycle to begin because I\u2019m tired of the news coverage of these events. There\u2019s the shock and horror, the pundits who scream more gun control and then the rebuttal that we need more guns to protect ourselves. A few political statements from our leaders who say this is not the time to talk about gun control....and Yada yada yada. Am I forgetting a step?, 6 We live in a very sick society. In my opinion the govt. ( thru their vilification of whomever is the recent object of our military industrial complex ),  the media, that offers up more, and more graphic and gratuitous violence, and politicians who appeal to the most base elements of society in order to garner votes., 6 Red state politics - red state consequences. Sadly, this will change nothing., 6 May we talk about limited guns yet?\n\nNope?\n\nSo guns are more important to you than lives? Don't talk about precious fetuses then, either.\n\nHigh-powered machines for killing people at a distance are not what the Constitution was written for. Shameless exploitation!, 6 I knew after absolutely NOTHING was done after Sandy Hook that you could skeet shoot babies off the Capitol steps and no one would care. I'm sure the shock of this will wear off by tomorrow, and no one will care - especially not our NRA paid for government representatives who will offer meaningless thoughts & prayers, but no real change to stop these horrific acts from happening. Trump will do nothing & offer no compassion or condolence or leadership. , 6 At some point we are all going to get fed up with the NRA and legislators who do nothing but advocate more guns for everyone. They are pushing all Americans to demand a ban on all guns of every kind.\n\nYou moderate gun owners need to get on board with gun control, or else y'all will find yourselves without any guns at all. And the military will indeed be prying them out of your cold, dead hands. , 6 A gun is a machine.  A tool whose function is to propel.  A small fragment of metal.  To propel a small fragment on a path to a target.  To an impact at very high velocity.  \n\nIt is a soulless machine.  It is a soulless tool.  Without compunction or remorse.  \n\nWhose purpose is to kill.\n\nWhy is it worshiped?, 6 If a virus or bacteria killed 17 adolescents in one day you can bet the CDC (before Trump) would be all over this with research on how to eradicate the causes and the virus itself.\n\nHow is this different?, 6 To each US resident who is planning to comment here:  \n\nPlease state, at the end of your comment, the \u201cname\u201d of any US Senator in your state, or US House Member in your state district, that you know has actually opposed reasonable gun control measures, as evidenced by public statements, votes, and/or NRA approval ratings.  I name my US House Member representative:  Elise Stefanik, 21st District, NY State.  She has campaigned on a platform in which she states she is against NY\u2019s \u201cSAFE\u201d gun control act, which was enacted by our State after the Sandy Hook Massacre.  \n\nThe only way we can rid this scourge of gun deaths from our nation is to  (1) enact campaign finance reform or (2) SHAME publicly these seemingly shameless representatives.  \n\nYes, we can write and call in addition, but the NRA campaign recipients will obfuscate as long as they are allowed to do so., 6 The video/audio from someone\u2019s cell phone of this carnage bleeps out the \u2018dirty\u2019 exclamations of those who were there, but what we can hear loud and clear are the blasts from the shooter\u2019s AR 15. Now, which of the sounds is more obscene?, 6 I think it\u2019s about 20 years too late to do anything about these massacres . The patriots think owning a gun makes a person a true american . Case closed . As I sat eating in a restaurant on Valentine\u2019s Day with my wife I was relieved to be sitting right next to an emergency exit . America 2018 ! , 6 Paul Ryan said, \u201cWhile we now wait to learn more, we are so grateful to law enforcement and all those who brought this horror to an end,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cLet us all keep the victims in our hearts. A long night lies ahead for many families. Right now, the whole country is standing with the Parkland community.\"\n\nNo, Mr. Speaker, we're standing waiting for you to do something.  You can bring legislation to the floor to stop this, you can bring legislation to the floor to help others, you can bring legislation to the floor to make this a better place where high-school students don't have to drill for the day when someone takes a semi-automatic weapon and shoots them.\n\nYou are not much of a human being much less a good Speaker. But I'm sure you'd act within minutes if you could rob another dollar from the poor and give it to the rich, while burning incense on the Ayn Rand altar. You're lower than low., 6 \"Sending thoughts and prayers to a once great nation unwilling to face the demons that possess it.\", 6 Congress won't do anything except send their thoughts and prayers.  Since Columbine, more than 150,000 kids have been exposed to this gun violence in their schools.  I can only hope these children will one day hold seats in Congress and will not be owned by the NRA., 6 The defense here is simple.   \"those school people wanted to take my guns away,  and I stood my ground.\"\n\nThis is Florida after all.., 6 I'm anxiously awaiting the \"now it not the right time to talk about gun regulation\" utterances from the bought-and-sold NRA politicians. No doubt, the \"thoughts and prayers\" mantra has already been flooding the airwaves and web., 6 Yet another day, another shooting, another tragedy. The NRA would come up with a statement that the kids could have been safe if there were more guns on the campus. \n\nSeen this story repeat far too many number of times. I lived in the U.S. for many years but I could still never understand the fascination American Govt (and presumably a majority of its public) has with protecting the 2nd amendment. , 6 It could not be more clear that the federal government as it stands now, refuses to get involved in this epidemic. Vote Democratic Party in 2018, and save lives. , 6 \"Rick Scott is heading to the school\"\nI feel safer already.\nBut seriously, what is he going to do? Unless, he supports legislation to ban assault weapons (at the very least) then he is just worthless in this situation., 6 It's been 4 months and 13 days since the Las Vegas shooting, and I have questions. \n\nHey Congress, how's that law banning bump fire stocks coming along? Oh, been busy with continuing resolutions and government shutdowns?  I see...well, when you get around to it, let's ban AR-15 assault rifles while you're at it. (Not holding my breath - it's been 18 years, 9 months, 25 days since the Columbine High School massacre.)\n\nSarah Sanders, when you're asked about gun control policy in the next 24 hours, and you tell us once again that \"there will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that\u2019s not the place that we\u2019re in at this moment,\" also please tell us: when in the past 135 days was the time?   \n\nSean Hannity, perhaps you can advise the president to cut back a bit on his Executive Time and show some leadership on this issue?   , 6 Is it time to force Congress act? How about all teachers across the country refuse to show up to their deadly work environments? Shut down the school systems nation-wide until Congress bans civilians from purchasing weapons of mass destruction.   , 6 Once again: horrific and so very sad.  My heart is broken for all.  Maybe another aircraft carrier will make this a better, safer country., 6 God gave us free will David Gregory.  He is not to blame.  The Lord is close to the broken-hearted.   I feel so sorry for those poor high-school kids.  Such trauma.  The parents who lost kids will cry and try to live.  After a while the only thing they can do is pray for acceptance.  I am afraid for my grand-children who will go to school.  , 6 Just the other day, I was thinking \"things have been a bit quiet lately on the mass shooting front. I wonder when the next massacre will be.\" Because sadly it's just a matter of a few days and we're all just bracing ourselves., 6 What if every investor sold their shares in gun manufacturers; all gun shops were incessantly picketed; all gun shows were congested by militant gun control activists; all gun purchasers were picketed on the street in front of their house; all NRA members were Outed, and their businesses boycotted; and \u2014dream of dreams\u2014legislation was passed to place all state gun sales under control of the National Guard; and all gun manufacturing is nationalized and managed by the Dept. of Homeland Security. \n\nThe mentality of guns as profit center and desiring guns for recreation is nuts. \n\nAnd the rationale of buying guns for protection is dangerous. Calling 911 is cheaper. Giving police the man/woman power they need for adequate quick response is smarter., 6 I agree with Paul from Connecticut - so much for a 'well-regulated militia'.  We have a well-regulated militia and it protects us just fine without blurring and trampling on the real meaning of the 2nd Amendment. \n\nAnyone living in rural America appreciates a firearm for home protection and sport but this is an obscenity. Only honest, good-standing and reality-based members of the NRA can stop this madness., 6 U.S. has become a country incapable of correcting its problems. The political system is in gridlock and under the control of special interests and corporations. Until you remove this nexus nothing will change. , 6 The United States has 1,281,900 military service members, with a further  801,200 in reserves.\nState and local law enforcement agencies employed roughly the same number.\nSomehow, Americans have been made to believe that some untrained yahoo with an AR-15 somehow will add to that protection, throwing up an insurmountable wall against foreign aggression. Conversely, they believe that same rifle will protect them against the 3 million or so soldiers and LEOs.\nWhy are madmen ruling the U.S.?, 6 I would say ban the AR-15, ban large capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, have mandatory background checks for all types of gun sales; but we have been saying this for years. Florida basically has no gun restriction laws. When will we ever learn. 'The answer is blowing in the wind'. It is time for basic morality to win out, I wish., 6 Senator Richard Blumenthal just said on\n\"Hardball\" that 90 people are shot to death every day in the United States. He went on to say that those in Congress who won't stand up to the gun lobby are complicit in this. \n\nHe's right of course. We, the people of this country, have to remind our elected officials that they work for us, not the NRA. Call your senators and representatives and don't stop until they take action on this issue., 6 \"No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\"  DJT 2/14/18\n\nAnd yet that is exactly what EVERY American child, teacher or anyone else DOES feel right now. Unsafe at school, in the \"land of the free and the home of the brave.\"  In what alternative universe should a kid have to risk his/her life just the go to school?\n\nHIs prayers and condolences are beyond worthless at this point. Rather, they are disgusting. \n\nThe world is astonished at our consistent lamentations every time this happens...and then the COMPLETE lack of action to do anything AT ALL to address this insane American reality show turned real, now on a weekly basis!\n\nThis is the definition of insanity., 6 It is morning here on the other side of the world, and I can hear birds. And now that i have logged onto the news, gunfire and screaming and hysterical kids and terrified parent.  We do not have guns. I have not a single friend or acquaintance who likes, wants, needs or uses a gun. I have no idea how to buy a gun as I have never seen them advertised in shops, catalogues or online in Australia. No one I know has any idea how to shoot a gun. I did use a gun once on a farm, where they used it to cull kangaroos and rabbits. That was about 40 years ago. My husband works in a high school, and it is not difficult to imagine the emotions and impact of YET ANOTHER event in a school upon the children, teachers and families. What a thing to expose children to.  When are you Americans going to do something? I fear the media are exporting these visceral, extreme ideas of revenge across the world. Where is the leadership on the issue of gun violence?  , 6  It's clear and obvious, legal ownership of assault rifles is to blame for America's high number of mass shootings. America will be great again when it puts its citizen's safety before political lobbying, and vote mongering, and joins the rest of the civilized world in banning guns, especially assault rifles. Guns don't keep you safe America, and no one needs or should own an assault rifle. , 6 I'm not a frequent talk-radio listener, but while riding in an Uber this morning, I heard one of the talk-show hosts barking about how Obama and the Lib-ruls forced Remington into bankruptcy, and what a sad, sad day it was for industry, and the second amendment, and America, and Freedom, &amp;c.\n\nThe US Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reports the number of firearms processed each year.  According to their statistics, firearms sales have grown at a CAGR of 26.76% from 2005-2016, from 150,000 units in 2005 to more than 2.5 million units in 2016.  Moreover, units processed jumped almost 78% from 2015 to 2016.  If you don't believe me, see for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.atf.gov/n/n/sites/default/files/media/2017/05/number_of_nfa_...\n\nNow I haven't read Remington's filings, and I bear the organization and it's employees no ill will being an owner myself, but I find it shocking that a substantial number of talk radio listeners will swallow such false statements whole-cloth.\n\nAnd for Pete's sake, when does the Right stop wailing about Obama & Hillary? Republicans control both the legislative and executive branches of government. I'm not sure about the current status of the judicial branch, but I can predict where it's headed over the next 3 years or more.  Presidents don't make laws - not even Obama - so when may we stop talking about the past and address the crisis of our future?, 6 We have a generation of children growing up with this trauma. I'm sure many assume it will happen at their school some time. The images of children marching or running out of a school with their hands over their heads is haunting. I don't know how they will process the trauma. And they're the lucky ones - they're not dead. If I had a school age child now, I would home school. We have a full-fledged school shooting culture. Kids expect they may be shot at school, parents live in fear, society shrugs., 6 A central role of and requirement for our national elected politicians is to get out in front of such situations when they occur. The nation needs their moral and intellectual guidance. They need to address the underlying issues so that such incidents become less likely. We don't want prayers. We want leadership. We have not heard from the White House at all. The president and the leaders in Congress are not doing their job. , 6 As a teacher this is my nightmare. Ever visited a high school at dismissal? The students are everywhere, in the halls, selling cupcakes in the lobby, playing catch just outside the building, gathering for sports practice. The children are sitting ducks. We have regular lockdown drills. Securing a school during the day when most students are in class is what we practice, but no lockdown practice can possibly be effective at dismissal. Why can\u2019t we care enough to protect our children?, 6 If we cannot keep our kids safe in school, what good are we as a society?, 6 Something has got to be done. We cannot accept school shootings as an unavoidable part of American life. Why so many people  do is beyond comprehension. , 6 We do not understand how this can happen, so regularly, so predictably, in what is supposed to be the most advanced nation in the history of the world. \n\nSigned, all other Advanced Nations., 6 Why are schools having to get better at handling school shootings then the government is at preventing them?  There is something so wrong, we all know it, and yet children continue to die and not return home.  How long, how long!, 6 For the umpteenth time the President expresses his prayers and condolences to the parents of their dead children and authorities, once again, are expressing their concerns and history of the shooter and his obsession with weapons.  He also lives in a state that has some of the most liberal gun laws in America.  This is just one of at least three multiple shootings that have occurred in the last few days, and the beat goes and tomorrow the media will have moved on and nothing will change.\n\nNo more lectures from me America because even when children are getting killed, still nothing ever changes, it's hopeless.  Tourists are correct, America is a very dangerous country and it looks like it is getting even worse., 6 I'm a high school teacher, and just went over the lockdown protocols with my second semester class today.\n\nI'm frightened that I'm teaching my students how to hide and protect themselves in an environment that is supposed to be about openness and curiosity., 6 We can't identify and lock up every angry or disturbed person with a grudge to fill.  What we can do is ban the tools that makes them so deadly when they do act.  No one needs an assault weapon.  No one.  At some point a society's right to Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness has to outweigh the very vague right for every citizen to own a machine gun., 6 Absolutely nothing will change.  The political will power simply does not exist.  I feel totally empty knowing that children being killed is just the way things are here in the US.  Still the greatest country in the world? , 6 The shooting is horrific. But no one even questions anymore the all-geared-up military-style security forces seen on the pictures. Folks, none of this is normal in developed societies. And it's all part of the same problem. \n\nUnless you really want to have guns to play with. Then it's not a problem, just an undesirable, but unavoidable, side effect. , 6 From time to time time I\u00b4ve seen scenes like this in US schools , but nobody do nothing about it. Until when, how much lives more for  the authorities think serously about guns in US.Change the goverment, Obama, Trump, Bush but nobody has courage to face this problem. My condolences to the families., 6 Parkland's mayor, Christine Hunschofsky, was quoted on the Radio today as saying that Parkland is a safe neighborhood.\n\nNo Ms Hunschofsky, it is not a safe neighborhood because the citizens of Florida, in their wisdom, have decided to allow anyone and everyone to carry a gun\nAny neighborhood in a state with lax gun control laws is an unsafe area\n\nI'm sorry for you loss, but maybe you and the Citizens of Florida will take today's horrible events as a time to make a resolution, to make your neighborhoods safer by restricting firearms\n\nRespectfully yours, 6 If we had a government that served the needs of its citizens, rather than those of its corporate donors, we would have seen this madness end long ago. Pay attention to who you're voting for, and their level of advocacy for gun control!, 6 Members of Congress will predictably talk about their hearts and minds being with the victims, but their votes will remain with the gun lobby.  Mass shootings in the U.S. are like drunk driving deaths and maimings, in the sense that society tolerates a high level of carnage because it is unwilling to take the steps that would reduce it.  , 6 Now is never the time to limit assault weapons that serve no purpose other than the slaughter of humans., 6 Another all-American horror show.  Other countries don't have these tragedies on a regular basis.\n\nObviously, if we did what other countries do, we'd get their results.  We've chosen this instead., 6 I watched the TV in horror as Sandy Brook unfolded and it seemed like something would definitely come out of that terrible tragedy. But right now, I'm sadly relieved that I don't have any children and at least I won't have to deal with a school shooting as a parent., 6 I am really tired of \"Thoughts and Prayers\", they do not bring back our children. When will Americans be fed up? When will the NRA get out of politics? I am pro 2nd ammedment, but this nonsence with guns is insane. What will it take? When will enough be enough? Can we have laws that make parents criminally liable just as they had pulled the trigger themselves? More gun control, national gun registration. Fingerprints with each pack of bullets, with each weapon. No internet sales, no sales outside of licensed gun shops. If someone wants to sell a gun, it must go thru licenced dealer.\nThis insanity has got to stop. When we have more people murdered annually by guns than other countries that are not in war its a problem.\nI am tired of the argument that guns dont kill people, people kill people. With the size of magazines, ammo, fire power ever increasing, surviving a gun shot is much less likely than other weapons, plus more damage quicker can and will be done.\nTime to get real people., 6 Thoughts and prayers, and no action, from Congress. I really hope Marco Rubio understands that his inaction and lack of vision is partly to blame for today's tragedy. I hope he watches the news tonight and realizes he's been brainwashed by the NRA and the mullahs in the GOP. I hope he realizes that the second amendment is compatible with sensible reform. My thoughts and prayers - other than with the victims and their families - are with Marco Rubio tonight and the other logical GOP Congressmen that would have been \"normal\" Republicans pre-1994. They can fix this, and that they can't or won't speaks volumes about our country and its decline., 6 So another empty seat at the dinner table, another empty desk at school, another friend gone before life's dreams were realized, and we will all go about our business yet again, numb to the pain, suffering and sorrows of parents, friends, and relatives whose lives will never be the same again, because we know that nothing, absolutely nothing will be done.  The Republicans along with the President will offer the usual \"thoughts and prayers\" then tout the second amendment rights of all citizens, and the usual \"guns don't kill people\"....\nThey were unmoved by Sandy Hook, they were unmoved by the shooting in Aurora, Orlando, and Las Vegas, and dozens of other cities.  They were even unmoved by fellow Republicans being shot.  They will take the blood money from the NRA coffers which fuel elections and go on about the business of destroying social safety nets and enriching the already wealthy.\nExactly which \"well regulated militia\" did the shooter belong to?, 6 If we wait the Republican controlled Congress, who is in the back pocket of the NRA and the gun lobby, to create genuine gun control legislation, we will wait forever and witness countless more episodes of gun carnage. Our only solution is to elect Democrats to control Congress and enact sensible gun control legislation, not to ban rifles or pistols, but to prohibit ordinary citizens from access to military grade weapons and all emotionally and mentally disturbed people from access to guns of any kind. Tomorrow, Republicans in the House and Senate will participate in the obligatory \"prayer\" for the deceased and their families. Enough with praying. Time for legislation to staunch the carnage., 6 Why do we continue to put our children in these vulnerable positions that either lead to quick or undeniable destruction?  Get rid of schools and let the kids play and stop putting them in cages.  Ducks on the pond.  Bang., 6 This is so painful.  And yet, nothing will happen:\n- If the shooter was of an immigrant origin (legal or undocumented), the discussion will be about banning new immigrants to the US.  Tighten the borders.\n- If the shooter was an American born citizen, the discussion will be about curbing mental illness.\n\nThe NRA will want more guns in schools.  But somehow, they are OK with no guns in the White House, Congress or airplanes.  \n\nFamily and friends will grieve for their lost children.  We will all feel great sympathy for them.  Yet nothing will happen unless we make a change., 6 Is time to consider the concept of collective punishment. Anyone with any knowledge of a gunman with a multitude of firearms or knowledge of intent to do harm needs to be held accountable.\nHow is it possible that anyone in this gunman life, family or friends, not know about the risk of him doing harm?\nThe fundamental role of government is to protect its citizens. With mass shootings it's time for things to change., 6 No, President Trump, but children are made to feel unsafe in school in order to pay for the gun rights of those just out of school, but who clearly aren't adults yet.  Your choice:  safe schools for kids, or unlimited gun rights for children in young-adult bodies?, 6 This will sound mean, but I have to say \"who cares anymore?\"  Until the NRA and the republicans in Congress are forced to abdicate their power, this will continue and continue and continue and continue.  We can all predict the story for the next week - people will be angry, politicians will offer condolences, Democrats will call for stricter gun control, republicans will engage in fear tactics and try to claim that if all the students had had guns, they could have stopped this, and then the next shooting will happen and we'll all move on.  So again, I ask, \"who cares anymore?\", 6 \"Parkland, an affluent suburb of Fort Lauderdale with a population of about 30,000, is known for its good public schools. Douglas High is among the largest in the Broward school district, with about 3,000 students.\"\n\n3k students. Therein lies the rub. \n\nI taught for many years in a high school in an affluent neighborhood. At first the school was \"small\".  About a thousand students, but even so, teachers were able to get to know their individual students and their parents. About 350 students per graduating class. A teacher of senior students, as I was, I knew about 150 of those students. And their parents.\n\nThen the school expanded to almost 3k students. I no longer knew my 150 students from the community. Nor did I know their parents. \n\nThe school kept growing and growing, and pretty soon the school was like a small anonymous city. My own two children who attended the school where I taught, graduated each in a class of 1k.\n\nMy point is that when schools, especially high schools, become places of anonymity because of size, troubled students pass through the crowd, unnoticed. Teachers can't see them. Guidance counselors can't see them.  The crowd is too big.\n\nThe population of Parkland is 30k, according to the article. There is no reason to have one high school of 3k. With two high schools, each kid would have a chance.\n\nIf you think I am histrionic, walk the halls between class changes of 3k students. Listen to the sounds. Rather like hogs being corralled to slaughter., 6 The first thing I noticed was that the suspect was in custody.  We can learn so much more about these shootings from the words of the suspect than from political arguments.  I hope they can get this kid to talk. There is much to learn from what the shooters say or try to say and we have so much to learn.  I've always felt that more shooters could have been captured rather than killed.  For the purpose of shared knowledge, the police have done us a service here.  , 6 Please, don\u2019t report the name of the shooter, he was taken alive, on this day, Valentine\u2019s Day, this day , Ash Wednesday. We know the names of two many shooters, Eric Harris, Dylan Kiebold, Adam Lanza etc, please I don\u2019t need another name to add to the list. I want to know why he did it, but I don\u2019t want his name. This isn\u2019t going to end, if anything, if guns remain so easy to attain, the promulgation of violent  shooter video games, and violent YouTube videos, the quest for quick fame. Let\u2019s face it violent video games are training a whole generation on how to shoot, how to kill, while at the same time desensitizing them. This is no coincidence that this is happening now, a generation raised on violent video games, a generation that sees the fame of Lanza and Kiebold, this is just the beginning, it\u2019s going to get worse. I pray for the families, I cry for the lost children, I don\u2019t want to know his name or any of the rest, the ones emboldened to follow, all with easy access to a weapon., 6 This is the second mass school shooting on Valentine\u2019s Day. NIU Huskies marked the loss of 5 and over 20 more shot 10 years ago today. Every shooting at a school is a horrible loss. 10 years ago Virginia Tech and NIU bonded together over their tragedies. Today, can all of America be Forward, Together for Douglas HS and enact some sort of sensible gun control., 6 Of course no student \"should\" ever feel unsafe in a school. The fact is, based on recent experience it is completely reasonable  to feel  so. The question is, Mr Trump, what are you going to do about it?  Prayers are not enough.  Prayers do nothing... never have and never will. , 6 I currently attend university. Last fall, I was studying abroad in Taipei, Taiwan, when a former student threatened to start a school shooting on campus. While I was an entire ocean away from campus, I still felt the visceral shock and fear for my peers back home. Thankfully, the police stopped and arrested him before he could carry out his plans. They found about eleven guns in his home.\n\nThat day, the illusion of safety that I had in America was shattered. It took me to the realization that I, an American citizen, was safer in a foreign country than I am on my own soil. I am very sorry that these children had to learn the same lesson that I did - the hard way., 6 Either do something to make yourselves feel better i.e. ban AR-15\u2019s, limit magazine capacity, even stop law abiding private citizens from owning firearms; all of which will do exactly nothing insofar as criminals do not obey the law and there are millions of unregistered firearms in circulation OR solve the problem i.e. make it standard to post trained armed guards in schools which might offend your anti-gun sensibilities but will save children\u2019s lives. , 6 If we can't bring ourselves to limit the type and number of guns that people can buy; if we can't pass laws that make it mandatory to have training and insurance before you can own a gun; if we can't make it so military-style weapons are illegal on our streets, let's pass a law that whoever owns or sold the gun to someone who uses it to perpetrate mass murder can also be convicted of murder - and make sure they will face the same consequences: life in prison or the death penalty  \n\nMaybe then people would think twice about leaving their weapons unsecured, selling their guns to strangers, or supplying guns to criminals. \n\nWith the number of guns already in circulation in the US we need to address the problem in a creative way. This would be a (small) start.\n\nThe insanity has to stop somewhere, sometime. , 6 The other thing this is probably doing that is simply tragic and shameful is driving people away from teaching. I am glad there are still people brave enough to even go into a school every day. Given how fast and thick these incidents come, every teacher - and other school staff too - must go in every day trying to put it out of her mind that today she could be shot at school., 6 When will the madness end? It will end when we understand why it started. Guns were ubiquitous in the 60s, 70s and 80s but this type of catastrophe was almost nonexistent. What happened between then and now? Is it first person shooter video games, movie violence, social media, NRA, all of the above?, 6 Is our country turning into an unintended war zone because the mentally ill disenfranchised have no where to turn? As an ex-RN, I saw mental health services slashed and burned by Reagan. Huge psychiatric facilities were shuttered forever. Then came the insurance companies whittling their mental health coverage down to nothing. I can't help but wonder if there's a correlation., 6 As a middle/high public school educator I would agree that the first step is tightening gun laws and banning assault weapons. Just as important though is identifying students like the one who caused today's carnage. Early reports say he had been identified by school support staff as one obsessed with weapons and a credible threat to other students. Administration was so concerned, he was banned from bringing a backpack to school for fear of concealing weapons.  There is not a teacher or administrator who can't think of at least one current student who fits this  description. So tomorrow in public schools all across this country, including my own, we will have practice lockdowns while calming  our student's fears. All the while knowing locked inside our schools we have students with serious mental illness which if left untreated will result in future front page headline school shootings. , 6 It sickens me to see another 17, or more, innocent lives lost to this kind of senseless carnage.  This is a deep, deep American wound.  It is too easy to cry out and say we must get the guns.  This is about so much more than merely the guns.  This is too much bloodshed and turning away from what our country must face, the truth about how we are raising our children and how easy it is for them to get their hands on weapons, any weapons., 6 How can we come together to prevent this from happening again? How can some of us, believers in gun freedom, collaborate with others of us, who want gun ownership abolished? Is there even a middle ground we can contemplate, consider, foresee? Perhaps we should listen to the people in the middle: those of us who believe in responsible gun ownership with stricter parameters, legislation that reflects the intent of the Second Amendment, and mental health care for all. , 6 As a high school teacher, my heard breaks, and then hardens a bit after each of these attacks. Today at school, my students exchanged flowers, chocolates and wrote silly puns about love on the board. Some bemoaned their lack of a SO, others exchanged cards with their friends. That is ALL these students should have been distracted by today. Instead, this. We have an email from the district asking us to watch out for students tomorrow who might be upset by the news...We will offer counselors for students tomorrow who need them...And we will all huddle in corners with lights out or remind students to 'raise their arms' during evacuation during practice 'intruder' drills' so police don't confuse them with attackers.These are the lessons we teach now. This is high school in the US, 2018. There is no escaping this reality.  , 6 Where is our national leadership on the issue of school gun violence? Mass shootings happen far too often in U.S. and really nothing is being done. Sadly a question of when, not if it will happen again. The complacency is alarming., 6 Another shooting and another reason for me, as an immigrant, to consider life somewhere else. This is turning out to be a very macabre social experiment testing the limits of the American social fabric. When no one has any desire to do anything after repeated massacres, over and over and over again ad nauseam, then the society and the people have failed and lost their humanity.\n\nI cannot think of any other society, civilized or not, on this planet that tolerates the status quo that the American society has been willing to tolerate so far., 6 The AR-15 and firearms like it are weapons of war designed to efficiently kill armed soldiers. They do not belong outside of the military. This kind of horrific event will continue to happen until their senseless sale to civilians is banned. The right to bear arms is an ancient concept that was conceived before this type of killing machine existed. The spirit of the law is to provide for the self-defense of citizens, not for their offensive capabilities. Surely the Founding Fathers would recognize the disgusting profit-driven reluctance to prohibit these weapons to be an obvious danger to our national welfare. When will we?, 6 Yesterday it was a police commander shot and killed in Chicago who we read about, but there were another 80-85 lives lost to gun violence, twice that number of people who suffered non-fatal injuries, and another 1000+ Individuals were were victims of gun crimes who, thankfully were not shot. And it is the same thing today because 80-85 people die of a gunshot wound every day in the United States and twice that number of people suffer non-fatal injuries and 1000 or more people are victims of gun violence,\n\nWe have tried it and tried it and tried it the gun lobby\u2019s way which is the President\u2019s way and the way of the leaders of the Republican caucus as well as the rsnk and file. And every day 85 lives are lost and and and....\n\nWe need to lead because they won\u2019t. Universal background checks, reinstate the assault weapons ban and ban on high capacity magazines, one gun a month, increased oversight of gun dealers, and revoke the protection from civil kitigation the gun industry was granted secetal years ago.\n\nThe gun lobby, the President, Ryan, McConnell - there way has failed us again and again. One school lost 17 members of its community today.  It is time to give gun control a try and to hold the gun industry accountable for failing to do more to prevent the endless carnage of gun violence visited upon us day after day. , 6 We have been shot in our malls, in our churches, in our hospitals and in our schools. Each mass shooting not only devastates families but also changes the community forever. The pain is often intense and from personal experience lasts for a long time. When the television cameras leave we often forget the victims and the communities which have been changed forever. This recent shooting in Florida rekindles the fears of those in the past Connecticut, Texas, Nevada and almost every part of the country. They need our support now and for much longer than you can imagine. It is no different than the trauma that soldiers returning from combat experience -Except for one thing. This combat is amongst ourselves. The enemy is us. Our ignorance and our foolishness. Our lack of consensus of a simple truth that guns have to go. , 6 It\u2019s pointless to say anything, even I\u2019m sorry.  We lost our right for even condolences when the speeches started but the blind eyes turned.  There\u2019s no forgiving us anymore., 6 I graduated from H.S. in 1968. It was violent year. But, I NEVER woke up and even imagined that there would be guns and gun violence at my school. Now I wake up and the NRA tells me that the only way to stop a \"bad guy with a gun\" is to have a \"good guy with a gun.\" The Senate will debate a law of reciprocity of allowing persons with a concealed carry permitted gun being able to take it into every state in America. It is not unthinkable if I live another 20 years for the NRA slogan to include, \"the only way to stop a bad student with a gun, is a good student with a gun.\" We have lost our minds if we the people are going to allow this. Blame the government system of lobbying sand legal bribery for all of it. , 6 I watched the video and I wept. The kids hold up the phone, teenagers abuzz with confusion and energy of a plain school day suddenly disrupted with something worth filming, and then the brutal shock as gunshots are heard so close, as if the shooter was just there, one after another. This is how trauma happens; this, when your belief that an ordinary school day cannot really turn into a blood bath is suddenly and unexpectedly torn to shreds, and your mind now scrambles to rewrite what is ordinary. The very wiring of a child's mind is rerouted to incorporate a new ordinary: bloodbaths. You live in constant anticipation, even when you're lucky to survive.\n\nEvery time there is a story like this I imagine that it's my child and I quietly cry. I feel so helpless and so so so very sorry for these children, these families, people who do not deserve this. What hope is there, if we are always overpowered, in weapons and political power?, 6 Once again America demonstrates to the world what an Exceptional Nation it is.  It's never the free availability of guns that's to blame, it's always something else like video games or mental health.\n\nWell, if mental health is at the root of shootings (mass or otherwise), it's the collective mental health of a nation that elevates firearm ownership to the level of a deity., 6 Please don't refer to him as a \"gunMAN;\"  use the word \"shooter.\"  We must divorce guns from masculinity or manhood.  Using \"shooter\" would be one small but easy step towards doing this., 6 There is no reason a 19 year old should be able to get his hands on a semi automatic weapon., 6 If this was perpetrated by an immigrant, Trump will be claiming immigration ban, wall, more guns ... all of his \"great\" ideas would have prevented this... \n\nIf this turns out to be homegrown (terrorism or not) there will not be any discussion on gun violence or access to guns.. \n\nThis is a very familiar pattern now...\n\nwhat a horrible day  !, 6 Florida, aka The Gunshine State, has some of the most lenient gun ownership laws in the US. This shooting should be no surprise to anyone.\n\nElections have consequences, the more local, the more intense. Florida voters got what they voted for., 6 When will America be \"exceptional\" for good things again., 6 Thoughts, prayers, no constructive action, rinse, repeat., 6 ban semiautomatics\nconceal and carry DOA\nlaw enforcement must be vocal on ban, 6 Yet again the only nation on earth whose children routinely are gunned down at school asks \"Why did this happen?\", 6 Gun legislation? Not good enough. BAN THEM. Sorry hunters: take up golf or tennis or knitting. Enough is enough. Our kids and grandchildren deserve better. , 6 Our country is so very sick and lost.  Between this latest school shooting and the deeds our maladjusted president is trying to impose on our country i feel at times,  i am living in insane asylum.  I just finished reading a memorial card from a mother whose 21 year old son died from a drug over dose.  Her son was friends with my 21 year old grandson.  This does not help my mood., 6 It's too soon to discuss gun legislation. , 6 Background checks mean nothing and the right wing won't even discuss banning assault weapons. Maybe it's time to start talking about the NRA's worst fear: ban ALL guns, with huge fines and jail time for anyone possessing ANY gun. The Second Amendment is as archaic as powdered wigs and muzzle-loaders., 6 What happens next:\n\n1. Americans rush out and buy more guns\n2. Grieving relatives will be harassed by pro-gun conspiracy theorists convinced the massacre was a federal plot\n3. Injured survivors will be hit by medical bills they can\u2019t afford and will set up GoFundMe accounts\n4. The countdown to the next public mass shooting begins., 6 is this the new classic definition of public policy- keep doing (or not doing) the same thing  over and over and expect a different result? So long as the Republican party is in thrall to the NRA nothing will ever change., 6 More \u201cthoughts and prayers,\u201d but not much else., 6 I wonder if the founding fathers figured the second amendment would cause much blood shed in their own country. It's really a shame our Congress has no backbone to stand up to all this killing., 6 All I can say is it hurts in the stomach hearing this news. , 6 It is time to put a stop to this madness.\n\nThe police cannot help you in a mass shooting event 99% of the time. By the time they get there, it's too late. When they rush to the scene they don't know what they are facing, where the shooter is and how to prepare to take him down. If they go in blind, they might be killed instantly.\n\nThere are a number of steps that can be taken. While there are thousands of high schools, where most shootings take place, it is worth it, especially to parents and those who might be killed, to implement changes.\n\n1. Every classroom on the first floor of a building should have an exit to the outside.\n\n2. The administrators office should be equipped with an automatic, remote controlled locking system to lock the incoming doors from the outside.\n\n3. The remote control locking system should also lock the classrooms so that no one can get in but anyone can get out.\n\n4. Master keycards or other means should be available to the police both in the building and, when possible, before heading to the scene.\n\n5. A sound detection system can be considered that would show police where the shooting originates.\n\n6. The principal and others in the school can be equipped with counter measures, such as a bulletproof shield or even a moveable full cover.\n\n7. A paintball gun or similar device limited in lethal force can be provided. If you can slow a shooter, you can stop a shooter. The user must be willing to risk his life.\n\nI will post more at http://dougterry.us/, 6 We are the nation of the Second Amendment.\nWe are the nation of the Sick and Demented.\n\nI'm having a hard time telling the difference., 6  Let's face it, this is just another day now. , 6 I don\u2019t even care anymore. Not that I don\u2019t feel sadness for all those children, their families, everyone. It\u2019s terrible beyond words. But I\u2019m so jaded by the relentless stupidity of my country and it\u2019s obsession with guns. These right wing politicians are bought and sold by the arms industry to profit on the deaths of children and the fears of weak men and women. Think about that next time you vote Republican., 6 Prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences,prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences, prayers and condolences......., 6 Thanks Mr Trump and GOP... and for what it is worth the Democrats deserve some blame because they also often take the NRA's money... America will never be a \"great\" nation until we resolve our gun mad culture..., 6 It keeps happening.  Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...  I am sickened and my heart breaks, but what can I do?  I have no idea.  Do you?  , 6 Given the number of mass shootings in your country, you would think there would be enough people touched by gun violence to really push for change.  That is the truly sad issue.  People just pass it off as another day in good ol' USA.  You would think Sandyhook would have been the catalysis to make something happen, but then came Las Vegas and now this and how many more to come????  \n\nHere is the rationale people: you need to pass a driving test to get a license to drive a vehicle (a potentially deadly weapon), but testing on gun usage/ownership is not required in most states.  That makes total sense.\n\nReally America.  I don't understand your ignorance or inaction., 6 Any hope of sensible gun control died with the kindergartners in Sandy Hook. If that could not bring this nation together in doing something about gun deaths then nothing will. In fact that massacre caused a spike in gun sales as this one will do most probably.\nthis nation has accepted these gun deaths as price for gun ownership culture and nothing is going to change that., 6 And Trump with his useless platitudes.  Eighteenth shooting of the year so far.  How many school days have there been.  And then the people who want family values vote for a party which hands out these platitudes while they are paid millions by LaPierre to keep supporting guns.  This kid was known to the school to have an issue with guns, and there was nothing that they could do...even if he was expelled he returned.  He should have been in reform school or committed.  But as long as Florida allows people to carry guns everywhere, hidden, this will happen.  The God loving bible thumping South, the true lovers of guns, their family values upheld by a President who had at least one affair that cost him or those who contributed to his campaign.  Truly unbelievable...family values...what a joke.  Supporters of this kind of President, their unrealistic faith and dreams once again proven wrong., 6 What has this country become., 6 Don't need a single prayer or  any condolences Mr President, we need REAL men in Washington who are not afraid to stand up to the gun lobby and remove assault weapons from our country.  REAL men, not gun totin' deer killin'  insecure, imitation men. REAL men. Since you won't let women run this country., 6 My heart goes out to these families in a quite well-to-do section of Broward County.\n\nRepublican officials, on the other hand, including our lamentable governor and legislature, have earned my disgust. At every turn they have loosened control on guns by their legislation. And it follows as the night the day that if you give somebody easier access to an assault rifle or a handgun, they will shoot other people, often fatally. These weapons have no other purpose or use. Multiply the count and you multiply fatalities of innocent people., 6 Stated commitment by President Trump:  \u201cNo child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d\n\nUnstated commitment by President Trump: \u201cAnd I plan to do everything within my power to insure that anyone who wants to shoot large numbers of American schoolchildren and teachers can obtain the weapons of war they need to do the job.\u201d\n\nFlorida keeps electing political leaders who are also committed to the right to obtain weapons of war, so Floridians can expect to hear their leaders delivering their prayers to the victims\u2019 loved ones again and again and again. , 6 Nothing is going to change unless Very Important People (that is, politically connected or wealthy; same thing, iknowrite?) start getting shot frequently.  Sorry., 6 Cue the thoughts and prayers, and throw in a call for more good guys with guns. Then change the subject. Works every time., 6 America. My sincere condolences. Please get it together., 6 Wait for it....any minute now the NRA and its lackey Trump are going to start saying that this could have been avoided if all the teachers had been armed.  What in the world will it take to get even moderate gun control legislation passed????, 6 Thoughts and prayers that we create better gun laws., 6 When reporting the next mass murder in this country, consider posting, alongside graphic images of the slain, images of the following: a rifle manufacturer factory floor; the NRA\u2019s executives and lobbyists; the gun seller; the politicians who defend Americans\u2019 right to kill.  , 6 I used to be scared in school because there were bullies who threatened to beat you up. Mean girls. But I never worried about getting shot. I\u2019m terrified for every school kid in America, why?, 6 \"After San Bernardino, our business went up probably 50 percent,\"..... \"It's either two things: They're scared and need to protect [themselves]. Or they're afraid that [the government is] going to take it from them. There's the two things that drive our business.\"\n-January 2016\n\nWell looks like gun sales will rise again.  Twice as many guns per capita today than in 1968, over 300 million., 6 From Canada, a thought for my American friends. The enemy is not without. It is within., 6 Thoughts and prayers, repeat\nThoughts and prayers, repeat\nThoughts and prayers, repeat\nThoughts and prayers, repeat\nThoughts and prayers, repeat\nFeel better now?, 6 Seventeen empty chairs at the dinner table tonight and every night that weren't empty for breakfast. Thoughts and prayers ain't cuttin' it., 6 No, there *are* words for this:\n\"Gun control\"\n\"Background checks\"\n\"Assault rifle ban\"\n\"Mandatory trigger locks\"\n\"Free tax-funded mental health services\"\n\nAll we'll get is:\n\"More guns for good guys\"\n\"Thoughts and prayers\"\n\"Politicizing a tragedy\"\n\"700 billion tax dollars for the military\"\n\nI mourn for the dead today, and the many, many more to come., 6 My heart weeps for you, America. , 6 Not counting today, there have been 1,806 gun deaths and 30 mass shootings in the US so far this year.  Had enough yet?  Ready to change something?  No?  Well then, carry on., 6 \"Thoughts and prayers\" is another way of saying: As long as it doesn't happen in my backyard, I'm fine with it. , 6 I am just so very very very sorry. I don't know what else to tell the  parents and the kids and the brothers and sisters, and spouses of teachers. I just don't know what else to say. \n\nFamilies: You shouldn't be paying this price. I don't understand why we keep demanding it of people like you.  I just don't don't., 6 President Trump is absolutely right when he says, \"No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.\u201d Unfortunately, he is absolutely wrong to think \"prayers and condolences\" contribute in the least to accomplishing that goal.\n\nWe do react less over time to this mass violence. Sadly, that is a normal reaction, as events become common. Think back to the first suicide bombers in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. Then, a suicide bombing was considered a major \"event\", with all sorts of \"experts\" and specialists weighing in on the causes and prevention strategies. As time went on, we have arrived at the point where \"suicide\" has been reduced in the media and the public consciousness merely to an adjective preceding bomber. , 6 I lost hope that we will get real gun control in our country after nothing was done after Sandy Hook.  If the slaughter of 20 children between the ages of 6 and 7 could not change our love affair with guns, nothing will.  Maybe, some future generation of Americans will get it done, but not in my lifetime.  , 6 What will it take for this madness to end? I don't want thoughts or prayers. I want gun control. , 6 Guns kill people.\nIn my country, France, there are plenty of troubled people.\nBut there are far fewer guns.\nAnd therefore no school massacres every two weeks.\nWhen will the American right learn ?\n\nAnswer : never ?, 6 Just yesterday the Times published an article from John Lott, bemoaning the fact that some people can't get guns on demand. Why is his voice even heard? He is part of the problem as a shill for the NRA. Don't they already have the ear of the do nothing Congressmen and other politicians who refuse to pass any sensible gun legislature. Please publish articles from the victims here, the children facing psychological trauma being witnesses to this event, from the victims who are shot and face months or a life time of dealing with serious injuries, not to mention the expense, and from the parents who have to bury their children. All costs to cover the funerals and medical expenses should be sent the NRA and  to Congress. They love guns so much, let them pay for all the damage they cause. Thoughts and prayers just ain't going to do it., 6 The police and the military should have guns. No one else., 6 Too bad the gun industry's spokesperson, the NRA, and complicit politicos continue to block real, nationally funded public health studies of the causes of gun violence., 6 The fact that we will not address gun violence in our nation shows how completely morally bankrupt we are as a culture.  Why are tax cuts more important than children's lives?  These events are defining who we are.  , 7 Psychiatrists have told us over and over that they can't reliably judge who among the mentally ill will actually act out in horrifying ways like this.\nSo since we can't predict, are we to imprison all our mentally ill? \n\nWe all want to stop these horrifying things from happening, so let's look to the reasons that other countries don't suffer the way we do. Do they have less mental illness? Or do they manage their mental illnesses that much better than we do? I'm certainly in favor of improving our healthcare system--but we already spend more than anyone else, so money alone won't do it.\n\nBut if we simply ask other countries what they think the difference is, I don't think we'd hear mental illness as the central problem. And I don't think they'd tell us that their police are better than our police. What I keep hearing is that the US has a problem with guns.\n\nCan we be humble enough to take advice from the nations that don't have horrible events like this occurring over and over? Can we care about ourselves and our children the way they do?, 7 This is all that conservatives need right now to steer the conversation away from gun control to blaming the FBI, thereby also achieving the goal of discrediting the investigation into Russian meddling and the current administration's possible links to Russia. What about all the other school shootings that have taken place this year?, 7 Comey's team doing a great job.  Time to clean house., 7 The foolishness of Scott seeking Wray's resignation resonates with the fact that Scott has taken thousands of dollars in gun interest campaign contributions.  So..that means rather than speak about the gun issue he's deflecting (or attempting to) the discussion to the FBI lapse.  I'm sure Scott has offered his resignation every time a state employee in Florida has had a lapse., 7 The AR-15 is basically the same gun that was made for soldiers for Vietnam, the M-16, except that soldiers had a button to make them automatic. \n\n AR-15s, the most popular gun used in mass shootings, is NOT automatic- one trigger pull, one bullet, like any gun in the world you can buy.  The reason that so many choose them seems to be that they're light-weight, you can add lights, lasers, and other things to them, and to young men, they look cool.  This weapon is the one that is used in many, if not most, video games they've been watching since they started watching and playing those games.\n\n Does it mean everyone gamer is a mass murderer? No, just a few, who do great damage.\n\nSo, it stands to reason, if you're a teen and everyone around you drinks Budweiser, when you order your first beer, you'll order a Budweiser.  When you buy your first gun, after playing video games for years and seeing the AR-15, you'll buy an AR-15.\n\n  A shotgun would do the same damage, a handgun would do the same damage, except that the AR-15 can add a magazine to hold more bullets when you pull the trigger for each bullet. \n\nDo we need the AR-15 to hunt deer? Nope. To kill an intruder? Nope. \n\nCan we get the country to stop selling them? Probably not. And can we take back the AR-15 from any current owner, 99.9% who are responsible owners?\nAgain, probably not.\n\nThe mentally challenged people who are bringing guns to kill people are the problem, but can we jail people before they commit a crime?  No., 7 How many tips do they get. Today, how many tips are they getting. What are they doing today instead of dealing with those tips. Dealing with the blow back instead? Blaming is a strategy of the drift. Be a leader. Stop being part of the problem. Help. A newspaper can help, can investigate, can inform, can change the way we think, not sensationalize.\nWhat is the FBI's budget? Do you really want to leave it to the FBI to find all the lonely, rejected stressed out people?\nWhat if we build community, resilience. You know, left no child behind. We start with baby steps, resilience building. It isn't rocket science, it's social science. We  come together. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\nThere is a solution. It's called pro social group development\nIt starts by generating a sense of belonging. then we build critical thinking skills, and drive volunteering. It starts with asking the 1000's of SFSU grads who internalized a simple resilience building practice to show up at our coffee shops and bring us together...through story telling. Yeah.\nOf course we can do this. We will. It's just how low do we have to go before all of us are willing?\nSave the humans. Women and children first.\nImagine sitting in a small group of 4-10, objectively observing your subjective experience of volunteering - and listening to others do the same.\nA sense of belonging is a fundamental human need. How people handle isolation varies. Some become violent.\nLet's come together right now.\nThanks, 7 So they FBI bears no responsibility? Just gun control? Something wrong here on both sides., 7 FL Governor Rick Scott had pleas for additional funding for school safety WEEKS in advance of the shooting: he & the GOP packed legislature did nothing. Our mendicant in chief is all about \" mental health\" now... exactly one year after he killed legislation that restricted gun sales to individuals with mental health issues.\nIs this the best we can do for representative government?, 7 And a year earlier, with all these same concerns about him in place, he was allowed to buy a high powered, high capacity, military grade weapon. , 7 The problem is scale.  320 million people in the US.  If 1 % behave weirdly or suggest violence, law enforcement would be overwhelmed.\n\nEven if the FBI had interviewed him, what could they do?  He had committed no crimes.  He could easily lie.\n\nStop him from buying a gun?  There are dozens of ways to kill people.  Watch TV or read the news.\n\n148,000 Americans die from trauma every year.  If we improved emergency systems and had universal first aid training, we could save tens of thousands.\nSee the Natl Acad of Sciences study.\n\nOtherwise, thoughts, prayers, candles, and outrage are good ploys to avoid doing anything that requires hard work., 7 An AR-15 is a weapon of mass destruction. We have gone to war over weapons of mass destruction, yet we allow these things all over our country. It's time to outlaw these weapons of mass destruction. , 7 Congress should investigate; this gross mistake is exactly the sort of thing oversight is about.  \n\nBut my governor Rick Scott is a scoundrel.  Somebody needs to be fired, but it is not at all clear that Christopher Wray, in office five months is one of them.The question of who in the FBI made these terrible mistakes is an urgent question for the Inspector General, not for ambitious politicians.\n\n Scott, in Leninist terms, showed himself to be the President's running dog by taking advantage of the grief and horror at Parkland to call for the removal of an FBI Director as a way of undermining the Mueller investigation.  \n\nUnfortunately for Scott he called for Wray's resignation just as the Mueller investigation put an end to the possibility that any honest American could any longer think that Russia's meddling in the 2016 elections was \"fake news.\"\n\nChronologies matter. Could the Times' ace reporters ascertain and tell us whether Scott made his remarks before knowing of the indictments of the 13 Russians for meddling in the elections, or afterwards. \n\nIf he did so afterwards, the governor is also sleazy.  Getting rid of Wray would be an incentive to the Kremlin to keep meddling in this year's Congressional elections, probably to the benefit of Scott who will run, unless Scott has a patriotic conversion, against Senator Bill Nelson. , 7 FBI has one oops, a large one at that, but having the Director step down is crazy. If that happens, can we have Trump do the same thing and resign?, 7 It would help if we we had sane gun control laws.\n\nWhere did this story originate? How long will take Trump to totally blame the FBI? , 7 Hallways and stairs are death traps in that there are no windows to jump out of which he used a false alarm to create a funnel and used that same funnel crowd to escape.\nNC was a methodical planner so he wasn't legally insane but definitely violent and dangerous and his shrinks should have alerted authorities. If he had depression he would have killed himself. I hope new school buildings have automatic steel doors that bullets cant shoot through and there should be one main door for entrance as a checkpoint. Create a funnel for him. , 7 I have seen photos of the shooters arsenal that he had posted online in news stories on CNN.\nIn one of the photos there is a semi-automatic pistol.\nFlorida law did not allow the purchase of a pistol by someone under 21 years of age.\nThis may have been a law broken.\nCould someone more knowledgeable please answer?, 7 Do we really need more than the fact that he was expelled from school because he brought a knife-shouldn't that go in the gun shop's database to flag this as a person who has violent tendencies and lack of judgment?, 7 \"If you see something say something\" just worked here North of Seattle. A grandparent found guns, and journal entries her grandson had planning a big school shooting. The house was searched and there was enough evidence to arrest the 18 year old. It was a local law enforcement effort though, and a family member allowed access to the house.  Here is a link http://www.heraldnet.com/news/attempted-murder-charged-for-alleged-plot-...\n\nI cannot help but think that preventing this type of carnage will fall predominately on local law enforcement. The FBI is still pretty focused on terrorism it seems - that is terrorists linked to \"Al Qaeda\" etc. \n\nAt the least - at the very minimum the FBI should talk to potential shooter's when they get a tip. Can they do anything? Maybe not - but a family member willing to let them search a room might give them enough to stop more of these massacre's from happening. This type of attack should now be the number one priority - because it has been the number one reason for mass loss of life. It doesn't help that Trump has worked so hard to damage moral at the agency. All of that being said these high-power, semi-automatic weapons are shown to be the killing machine of choice by the lunatics - Congress should get them banned. There is plenty of blame to go around., 7 Since when  is the FBI responsible for preventing mentally ill teenagers from committing crimes???  Surely the local authorities  had that responsibility., 7 Time to go Mr. Wray., 7 Neighbors of the San Bernardino terrorists saw suspicious behavior and many odd boxes being delivered. But they didn't report anything \"out of fear of being accused of racial profiling\". \n\nOmar Mateen mows down 49 people in an Orlando nightclub. \n\nThe media bent over backward to not call them terrorists or evil people. \n\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev of the Boston marathon bombing gets his picture on the cover of Rolling Stone and made into a rock star. \n\nMany commenters here pounce on white shooters, demand to repeal the 2nd Amendment, demand \"something be done to turn them in ahead of time before they commit their crimes\", etc. But you'll notice they and the media always come to the defense of Muslim terrorists, and still demand that the U.S. allow any person who wants to enter the country in, even illegally. Give them Sanctuary Cities on top if it. \n\nWe have enough problems without rolling out the red carpet for more unvetted immigrants. If for the only reason their crimes are somehow excusable and many commenters said we rotten imperialistic Americans \"deserved it\";  but homegrown shooters are used as \"reasons\" to rip apart our Constitution. , 7 Gun control measures will never succeed with the Second Amendment in place. If you truly want gun control, stop dithering and repeal the Second Amendment., 7 Allow those who were killed by these guns to sue gun manufacturers. It is currently illegal to do so. Why? If gun manufacturers are hit in the pocketbook it might help to change things as the immorality of shooting children has no effect on them., 7 All we've heard from the Congressional clowns over the past weeks is that the average FBI agent is hard working,effective and dedicated.Really?This incident and others proves the inaccuracy of the statements from the Congressional clowns.Blame also lies with the school principal,the Broward County Sheriff,etc., 7 And, what about the county sheriffs office which received numerous calls and didn't act at all???  It shares a greater responsibility than the FBI, it seems to me., 7 Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, has a lot of chutzpah for demanding that Christopher Wray quit, considering he\u2019s done absolutely nothing to stop gun violence in Florida. In fact, he\u2019 s made it worse. He was the backer of a law that forbid doctors from discussing gun safety with parents who have gun safety in their homes. If only, Nicholas Cruz\u2019s mother or the family he was living with after she died had gotten some safety advice, perhaps Cruz wouldn\u2019t have had such easy access to guns. Scott also backed the stand your ground law, which allowed George Zimmerman\u2019s to be acquitted of his murder of Treyvon Martin, because Zimmerman felt threatened after he himself threatened Martin. Hi we man you other people in Florida have been killed because of this law?\n\nScott also voted not to expand Obamacare and Medicaid\u2019s Inn Florida, which might have provided more mental health care for Cruz and other troublrd people. And after the massacre in the Orlando nihjtclipub just Tso years ago, Scott did nothing to make assault weapon harder to buy in Florida. He kept silent and did nothing and then a couple days ago had the audacity to say, who knew this could happen here. Yes, the FBI messed up here, but Scott and Florida Senator Rubio, who got 3 million from the NRA are far more reasponsible fore the deaths of these 17 students and teachers than Christopher Wray is., 7 Well now - these are some of the same folks who didn't think there was anything to worry about when 20 guys from the Middle East were all taking lessons to fly commercial aircraft a few years back, even after the flight school called them about it., 7 Sad to look back and realize that the killings of 20 or more  5-6 y/o at Sandy Hook Elementary was not enough to make potititians turn their backs to  the NRA ,  ban assault weapons and strict gun sales to people with history of mental illness. The hardest ,  honest path to take will be to make public the tally of Senators that voted agains the Assault Ban and for the FBI to tally the number of monthly calls they get to inform of people that may cause harm in the local communities. Mr Sessions and Mr Scott ( Florida Governor ) are polititians with no courage , taking the dishonest path of less resistance: Blame the FBI !, 7 I'm always regretful that tips get overlooked and not passed along, but it's not the FBI's fault that this guy shot up the school -- the fault lies with the shooter. Also, we realize that we aren't a society that relies on a secret police force like the Stasi., 7 The commentators on Fox News are saying that if the FBI hadn\u2019t devoted so many resources to investigating the Russian disinformation campaign in the US, then the FBI would have had the resources to investigate Cruz. \n\nThen again, if the FBI Florida agents where not spending most of their time protecting the Donald during his many trips to the his golf courses in Florida, they would have had more time to investigate Cruz. So sad.\n\nActually others here are correct, the FBI investigation prior to the crime would not have ended up significantly restricting Cruz\u2019s freedom to obtain and utilize deadly people killing weapons due to the obscene control that the NRA has on the political process. This really is sad., 7 If you are able to ask questions to the candidates for the mid-term election, consider reframing the issue by asking:\n\"Do you support or oppose the NRA as a co-responsible party to for school shootings?\", 7 Mr. Scott ~ you may want to dismantle your high horse for a moment ~ the fact that this fell through the cracks is a horrible mistake ~ and, by asking for Mr. Wray to resign is nothing more than spreading around the blame and finding yet one more scapegoat for a tragedy that is repeated over and over again in this country without holding the real culprits of the situation accountable ~ the NRA and how they hold us hostage to an unreasonable attachment to the second amendment.   Perhaps, we ought to deport them!, 7 If one this country not let the assault weapon ban expire in 2004, i am wondering if we could have at least saved half the innocent lives lost since then. , 7 A local Uber driver, perhaps a parent as well, delivers a passenger with an AR 15 to a school and then did what?, 7 Rick Scott needs to take responsibility for the government of his state. Instead, he plays politics by demanding the resignation of the FBI Director. Why are teenagers allowed to buy AR-15s in Florida?? , 7 This is not  the first time authorities  have failed to recognize a mentally ill killer and tragically it won't be the last.  There is something very wrong with our gun laws.   They are much too lenient.\nThe law that President Obama put into place by not permitting the mentally ill to purchase guns was recently overturned by that person in the White House.\nWhat will it take to change the gun laws......perhaps when NRA members lose loved ones.  No one should be permitted to own an assault weapon.  , 7 America failed these kids, don't try to pin this one on the FBI. If we had reasonable gun control, they'd still be alive. If we had reasonable mental health care, they'd still be alive. If we had a culture that celebrated violence just a little less, they'd probably still be alive. \n\nAlso, I've read that the shooter was an orphan and had been expelled from school. Someone like that is bound to be pretty angry. Was there no one in this kid's life who could've steered him onto a better path? And even if there hadn't been, that's still a pretty good argument for keeping firearms out of the hands of children. 19 years old is still a child, mentally and physically. \n\nThere are very angry people out there, for whatever reason, and we make it easy for anyone of them to buy an assault rifle. This is madness. These massacres will continue until these weapons are taken out of the hands of the general population. Only the Army ought to have access to such firearms. , 7 so....a foreign hostile power interferes with our election, leaving us with a president who increasingly looks to be their pocket as head of government who seems to be doing everything he can to interfere with the on going investigation (let's set aside all of the other troubling aspects of his \"leadership\" such as calling the press the \"enemy of the people\"), and this! this is what the Republican governor of Florida wants the head of the FBI to step down over... that the FBI somehow failed to clearly predict the future and stop someone from doing something he hadn't yet done! (oh, let's not forget many of us would fall into the matter of \"suspicious behavior\" of we were held lateral interpretation of every word we ever spoke about).  isn't FLA the state with \"stand your ground\" and easier access to firearms?  and it's the FBIs fault??? please., 7 There are probably several dozen million people in the US who could be described in the same exact terms, or worse.\n\nShould the FBI investigate all of them?  And who's going to pay for that?  Oh, sorry, I forgot.  The republicans are in power.  No one's going to pay., 7 The murder of the school children must be reported, of course, but the excessive and repeated coverage of the story by newspaper and tv makes the likelihood of it happening again worse.  In the movie Bonnie and Clyde, the murderer and bank robber gloats over the appearance in the newspaper of his killing and robbing, which says so much of the motive in the minds of these disturbed young people in committing such atrocities.  Newspapers and TV then, must curtail their sensationalist manner of handling such stories, both in their frequency and manner, if they wish to live up to their function of serving the people as well as informing them., 7 The Republicans just found out that there are indictments against Russians who interfered in our elections. This threat against Wray is a purely political ploy. I actually can't believe l am reading this., 7 The Times might think it is on the cutting edge of getting to the heart of matters with this story, but in fact The Times only gives support to the right wing in its attacks on the FBI (as long as the FBI is investigating Trump). The fault for this latest shooting is not with the FBI. It is with the United States of America, and as long as the insanity of unfettered ownership of firearms continues, that is exactly where the fault will lie., 7 I quote the headline for an NBC News story dated February 28, 2017: \"Trump Signs Bill revoking Obama-Era Gun Checks for People with Mental Illness\"  The bill was H. J. Res 40 passed by both the House and the Senate with the most of the Republicans voting for the bill, and a most of the Democrats voting no.  So when Governor Scott says FBI Director Wray should resign, it would be most appropriate for him to say that President Trump should resign.\n And since he and Florida Attorney General Bondi are Trumpies, maybe they should resign as well.  The FBI Director is doing a great job considering his pressures., 7 If you see something say something and we\u2019ll just ignore it as we\u2019re too busy still trying to prove the Russians elected Trump. , 7 In America, you get arrested after, not before, you commit a crime.  The fault is squarely with the perp.  HIs accomplice and enabler is the NRA but President Trump set the tone, making violence, rather than discourse, the new national stereotype., 7 Perhaps Gov. Scott could act to control the proliferation of \u201csporting rifles\u201d in his state. We all know what \u201csport\u201d they are used for. , 7 How about making it illegal for people to own or acquire military firearms and buy back the ones that are already out there, as Australia has done?  Or is that too obvious?, 7 \"Rick Scott, the Republican governor of Florida, said the bureau\u2019s failure to act on the tip was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and called for the bureau\u2019s director, Christopher A. Wray, to resign. \"\n\nSorry Gov Scott. This is not a back door way to protect the president. Want someone to resign? How about Republican lawmakers that refuse to solve the problem with gun control?\nWhat's a mentally ill person with a gun? A murderer.\nWhat's a mentally ill person without a gun? Mentally ill.\nThe solution is simple., 7 Count on Rick Scott to turn this into politics and get on Trump's side to get rid of Wray...If anything..Rick Scott should resign since as governor he did not see to it that there was proper security at Parkland High School..., 7 1. Instead of building a Big Beautiful Wall, fund mental health treatment.\n2. Get rid of assault weapons. ASSAULT weapons, the name pretty much says it all.\n3. Speak not the name.  Media needs to report the incident, but include no photos or names.  Deny them their week of fame.  , 7 Why don't teachers, principals, parents of children boycott schools across America until gun laws are changed?, 7 Even if the tips were investigated what can law enforcement do to prevent anything?  The issue is changing laws.  Why did Trump overturn Obama\u2019s prohibition on mentally ill buying guns and why isn\u2019t that at the top of the news?  , 7 An important question to ask would be, how many of tips like this does the FBI get every day?  I'm guessing it's hundreds.    , 7 Local police and the County Sheriff's office had been out to this kid's house 39 times because he was violent. The kid's friends had long known that he was violent. Neighbors knew he was violent. The school knew he was violent - they suspended him!  Everybody in that community that could have and should have made a difference failed miserably - and everybody wants to blame the FBI....\n\nWow.... just wow...., 7 Both the FBI and nearly all elected officials proudly wear the NRA blindfold of ignorance and inaction.\n \"We the people\" have a right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness and we exercise that right at the ballot box, no?, 7 Everyone needs to read Courtney/Maryland's comment 22 hours ago.  Take heed!   \"We the People\" need to report anything that is of concern to us because we must be the \"eyes and ears\" of law enforcement.  A grandmother recently turned in her grandson because of guns, etc.  Stay alert people!\n\nI do blame the FBI.  This is not the first mistake at the local levels of the FBI.  There are more and they go back years (e.g., death of Versace-1997, Florida).  Frankly, remember the Secret Service at the beginning of the Obama term.  They too had many mistakes.  The FBI now? Remember recently the US Navy in the Pacific?   Do not let the FBI off the hook!  These mistakes build up over years and then they all come together!  , 7 Our brains aren't fully formed until age 25. Young men are the most violent group (especially in America). No one should be able to buy a gun at a minimum until they're 21. Age 25 would be even better., 7 On, Friday, June 20, 2014, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed 5 pro-gun bills into law.  A strong supporter of the Second Amendment, Governor Rick Scott has now signed more pro-gun bills into law -- in one term -- than any other Governor in Florida history.  , 7 Governor Scott and Senator Rubio both have A+ ratings from the NRA. An A or A+ rating from the NRA needs to become a scarlet letter. Any politician with a positive rating from the NRA needs to be voted out of office. Every person that wants to treat gun violence as a public health issue, a public safety issue, to have sensible and effective gun regulations, needs to register to vote if they are not registered already, everyone who wants to stop the madness of gun violence in this country, needs to vote in 2018, in 2020, in the primaries, in every election and drive politicians like Scott and Rubio - everyone of them - out of office. Politicians who offer prayers, blame everyone else now including FBI as distraction (yes, FBI made a mistake in the latest school shooting; FBI should be investigated and held accountable, but they are most definitely not the issue) and then value guns more than the lives of school children - shameless. The best way to honor the memories of the 17 senselessly just killed, the 96 that die each day from gun violence, the 7 children/teens killed each day with guns is to end the power of the NRA and vile politicians like Scott and Rubio that put NRA money and guns ahead of innocent lives. Act. Vote. Make it Times Up for the NRA, Scott, Rubio and anyone that takes NRA money. We cannot let all those school children and heroic adults die in vain. No more!, 7 Rick Scott is the typical politician. He blames the FBI for this failure when it was his government that is really the problem. The FBI was not notified until recently when the problem with this family goes back close to a decade. Rick Scott needs to admit that he is as guilty as those to whom he wants to pass the guilt. Every police officer in Florida along with every politician in that state is guilty!, 7 There's a mentally ill young man out there right now who feels rejected, unappreciated, unloved and alone. Nobody pays any attention to him. He has few, if any, friends. He feels his life is worthless, hopeless. Then it dawns on him; he remembers how all those school shooters got attention, plenty of attention, national attention, worldwide attention, fame.\n\nAnd so, by publicizing in excruciating detail, the circumstances of the atrocity, on television, radio, newspapers, magazines and almost every other conceivable medium, the seeds of the next atrocity are sown.\n\nReport the crime, but never reveal the shooter's name or show his face., 7 People need someone to blame, to be the scapegoat.  This individual did not commit a crime until,the shooting.  What would theFBI have done with limited resources?, 7 Rick Scott and Little Marco are excoriating the FBI to divert attention from their inattention to the main issue -- a country awash in military-style guns that they are too craven to talk about..of course the despicable Coulter uses it as fodder to undermine law enforcers who are gonna lasso the Trump gang.  , 7 So Scott wants the FBI director to resign because his agency messed up. But Scott, with his A+ rating from the NRA made it easy for the shooter to get an AR 15, and Rubio, also with an A+ rating and $3.3 million of NRA's bribe money, voted to allow mentally ill people to get guns. \"If you see something, say something.\" I'm saying it., 7 Rick Scott has some nerve calling for Wray to step down.  Nobody is more responsible for these mass shootings than Scott and other politicians who take money from the NRA.  Scott should step down and apologize to all the families with dead children for which he is partially responsible., 7 Of course governor Rick Scot is calling for the resignation of the head of the FBI. It serves two of his political objectives. It is an attempt to change the subject from Russia's efforts on behalf of Donald Trump, and to distract from his slavish service to the NRA., 7 If treats are posted in social media it should be taken seriously. We have terrorists in our midst who are being ignored. , 7 Use of the word \"fumble\" in the headline is deeply flawed. You fumble a football. You fumble a pass. You do not fumble with human life:  you err, you fail.  Fumble is too easy a word to use here and misses the consequences of erring: life and injury.  Grievous error.  Period.  Call it what it is. Own it. Leave fumbles to sports., 7 The Governor wants the FBI to take the heat!! This is so outrageously backwards. Spineless politicians who decline to enact sensible gun laws because of corporate campaign donations and virulent gun lobbyists who do not represent the majority opinion are to blame. America has too many guns. The FBI are merely the last in line to defend against a series of prior pro gun social and political choices. The governor should resign for such a hypocritical statement., 7 Republicans Scott and Rubio are absolute hypocrites. Both support lax guns laws at both the state and Feeral level and then want to blame the FBI for not following up on an anonymous tip. Even if they did follow-up, what within the current state and Federal laws could they have done to prevent Cruz from commiting this attrocity?\n\nThe problem is lack of gun control, not lack of follow-up., 7 The obvious answer is to have an armed guard in every classroom.  Or maybe two armed guards.  That way the NRA can still peddle its most popular gun, the AR-15, to \"sportsmen and target shooters\" who think they are guaranteed by an 18th century document to use a 21st century military weapon.\n\nPaul Ryan said, This is not the time for politics.  Politics meaning gun control, of course.  Australia passed the National Firearms Act in 1996 less than a month after the Port Arthur mass shooting. Since the Federal Assault Weapons Ban expired in 2004, the NRA has had a nice run, padding politician's pockets.  Add to that a pathetic administration that spews hatred and lies.  Plus Russian trolls on social media stirring the pot of chaos by empowering a minority base. \n\nEnough!  Democracy not Idiocracy.  , 7 This was a failure of the FBI. They had all the information they needed to know they had a potential killer on their hand. Yet they did nothing. They did not even communicate with the Brodward Police or school official. They did not even advocate for more protective action. At the very least this guy should have been arrested and questioned and underdone psychological testing.\n\nThere was so much that could have been done to prevent this. They had all the warnings they needed, yet the guy was never picked up for questioning. The FBI was too busy looking under every bed for Russian trolls, that they could not be bothered about the safety of American citizens.\n\nStop wasting time looking for Russian trolls and both and start taking care of the life of Americans. , 7 Pre-crime huh? Well, this criticism was also leveled against the FBI for the attacks of 9/11/2001. Again, politicized beyond actually having anything to do with the actual incident. It's not our country's love affair with violence and free access to guns, it's the FBI's fault. Um, what about Las Vegas? Whose fault is that? If the FBI is responsible for this one, the NRA should accept responsibility for Las Vegas., 7 How much did all the demeaning criticism and pressure from Trump that was occurring when this tip came in interfere with FBI operations?  , 7 Rick Scott the so-called governor of Florida needs to resign, not the FBI director. Scott does not believe in climate change as Miami sinks underwater more each year. Scott, like most republicans, does not believe in gun control..He and his narrow little mind should not be calling for the FBI director to go, HE NEEDS TO GO~, 7 Scapegoating the FBI by people who have stood in the way of gun control  shooting after shooting after shooting is deeply offensive especially when this is being used for purely political purposes to deflect attention away from a treasonous president.  They have no shame, they have no honour, they are pure evil right up there with the shooter himself., 7 Governor Scott has done all he can to enable 18 year olds to buy assault rifles even before they can drink a beer.  Florida guns laws are the problem not the FBI director.  The Republicans overturned a law President Obama had in place to restrict the mentally ill from buying guns.  The Republican Party has blood on it's hand., 7 Yes, let's blame the FBI, because this agency has the ability, person power, time, and budget to devote to examining and cataloguing every adolescent and young adult misfit in our country.\n\nThe FBI will evaluate each adolescent for emotional health - they will evaluate the thousands and thousands of adolescents and young adults with depression, anxiety, obsessive disorders, personality disorders, etc, determining who is a danger, and protecting us from these individuals.\n\nIs it the plan to turn the FBI into a health care agency?\n\nWe could prevent easy access to guns - but no, let's charge the FBI with determining who is mentally ill and who might be angry, resentful, immature, vengeful, and impulsive . . . .\n\nWhere is the role for state and local agencies? Does the governor have any recommendations for how he and his administration might take some responsibility? No?\n\nOur country is completely off the tracks . . . over violent weapons to which we are sacrificing our children.\n\n\"It's the guns, stupid\"., 7 GOP governor pressuring Wray to resign.  Yeah.  That's not GOP politicians helping Trump.  Right.\n\nMueller's in the water boys.  He smells blood.\n\nAs to the Downald:  \"Methinks thou dost protest too much.\", 7 First let me start off by stating,  I am a life long gun owner.  I do not belong to the NRA.\n\nCheap Easily Available Semiautomatic Weapons !!\n\n This is the cause of these horrific massacres that happen over and over and over again with alarming frequency\n\nCoupled with the disturbing American mindset of  macho \"Rambo\" top dog has his day, this country is way off course.\n\nSome possible actions that come to mind:\nStop production of AR 15 and similar human hunting weapons.\nMake possession a Serious Crime\nInstitute a buyback \"no questions asked\" program paid for by manufacturers.\n\nGetting these guns out of circulation would be the first and easiest step.  Changing our twisted macho culture is much tougher.\n\nTake the easiest first step.  Get these human hunting assault rifles out of our homes and off our streets.  It can be done.  Think Australia.\n\nStop this madness that is destroying us all., 7 Please don't let this report distract you!  Yes, the FBI fumbled a tip they received among thousands they get each day of widely varying quality.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is this kid should NEVER have had a gun, and the gun he had should NEVER have been on the street!  Over and over and over and over, again.  How much more will it take for the voters to overwhelm the NRA and get common sense back?, 7 Wray should not quit.  This was the Miami bureau, a bureau in a state crazy about gun rights.  That factor has a chilling effect on Florida law enforcement against anything that smells of finding out whether or not someone is a gun threat.  \n\nThe second amendment as it gets interpreted by gun crazy Florida is what needs to be fixed, not Director Wray.\n\nNote to NYTIMES:  Investigate the chilling effect on law enforcement in states with \"hold your grand laws\" (like Florida) and other gun advocate appeasements.  , 7 Can we all finally agree that Obama\u2019s politicization of the FBI was a really bad idea?, 7 What could the FBI  have done? Visited him and warned against postings? and that he was being followed? He was not obligated to speak to them., 7    The first to resign should be the governor of Florida.  Then we must work our way up the bribery chain and get rid of all dirty elected officials.  They are the employees of the American citizens.  If they can't do the job let's get rid of them.  Now., 7 Why is the US the only first world country with these kinds of shootings?, 7 No doubt that the FBI dropped the ball when the tips about this murderer were never properly investigated. But for the Florida governor to call for the resignation of this newly appointed FBI chief is total hypocrisy. The Republican governor, Rick Scott, should be charged as an accessory to the murder of these kids and their teachers because he is a supporter of the NRA and has opposed sensible gun legislation which should have eliminated all automatic weapons from sale in his state. Only the elimination of these weapons of mass murder will end these tragedies. To blame the FBI for their failure to stop this sicko is ridiculous hypocrisy., 7 It is quite disingenuous to try to blame the FBI  or the Brauer County Sheriff's Office   for this lapse.  Even if they had paid a visit to the young man about his postings, all he needed to say is \"Gee, I was just joking\"  (something Mr. Trump and his enablers claim every time he makes idiotic statements or tells a lie).   Shall we charge the FBI with keeping tabs and watching every move of all the unstable people, crackpots and disafected lunatics that shoot off their mouth on line?  We would indeed require a police state to do this.\nThe fact remains that Mr. Cruz was able to LEGALLY purchase the assault weapons and ammo to inflict the king of carnage that is becoming much too often part of life in the United States.  Let's stop being diverted by smoke screens about mental health, and \"what ifs\" and deal with the real issue of why semi-automatic weapons are so easily available to civilians.  And let's not forget, even if Mr. Cruz had been adjudicated as \"mentally ill\" he would have still been able to buy weapons-- courtesy  the Republican Party  and Donald Trump who signed an executive order last winter (reversing a previous Obama order) to ensure that anyone thinking of perpetrating a mass killing will have at their dispossal the most lethal weapons for purchase withoput questions asked.  Sad!, 7 Yes, let's let Rick Scott with his A+ rating from the NRA distract us from a conversation about gun control by blaming the FBI.  , 7 The FBI is in total disarray and needs to be rebuilt from the bottom up. The criminal conspiracy to exonerate Hillary Clinton from all of her obviouss crimes and then frame Donald Trump is unspeakable and unforgivable. People need to go to jail., 7 If Mr. Wray is somehow responsible for this as Mr. Scott seems to think, logically so is Mr. Scott as the ultimate state overseer of Public Education in Florida. Of course this is a ridiculous statement and I know it, but scapegoating Mr. Wray for a failure at a local FBI office so misses the point of this tragedy it makes me want to vomit; no doubt Mr. Scott knows this as he deflects the conversation away from where it belongs - gun control legislation., 7 A Prayer for politicians who refuse to do anything to restrict the availability of military style weapons regularly used to slaughter our children, but instead offer prayers for the victims:\nMay the God of Mercy show you the same mercy you show to these victims and their families.\nMay the God of Truth judge the honesty of the reasons you give for your inaction, which never include that you fear the NRA will oppose your reelection.\nMay the God of Justice give you the full measure of justice that you should have given to the children cut down before their life even begins.\nAnd when you suffer and pray for help, may the God of Love give you every drop of comfort that you deserve., 7 Is it easier to buy guns in Florida than in NY?, 7 How quickly Republicans have managed to politicize this mass shooting., 7 Funny, I don\u2019t remember any calls for FBI resignations after 9/11. rick scott should shut his mouth and do more about gun violence in his state., 7 When will the people of Florida grow tired of Scott's posturing?  Wray retire? Gimme a break. Point a finger at Scott and ask \"What have YOU done to alleviate the risk of mass shootings'\", 7 Perhaps the best way to help prevent these shootings is to replace the words NRA with child-murderers.  Every time you see those letters, replace them with their meaning.  When you ask your legislators about where their funding comes from, ask them if it comes from the child murders., 7 Maybe if the FBI wasn\u2019t so busy spying on politicians at the behest of political rivals and maybe if they weren\u2019t so busy propagating this stupid Russian collusion nonsense they could have done something to prevent this horrific crime. Hopefully the soon to be released Inspector General\u2019s report on malfeasance in the DoJ / FBI will put them back on the crime prevention / law enforcement track for which they were originally designed. , 7  Give the kid a break, he was just growing up in a Republican controlled America. Hate and guns., 7 The NRA soaked Senator will do anything to make this not about the guns, and if the Republican Party can blend it in with their bash the FBI to save Trump project, Marco's their Nunes-for-a-day.  What a disgrace., 7 Rather than call for Christopher Wray's resignation, Governor Scott should have offered his own resignation following the latest gun tragedy in Florida.  Scott has demonstrated a consistent history of blind adherence to the NRA's most extreme positions on gun issues.  He has made it easier, and less costly, for Floridians to obtain concealed weapons permits, has opposed common-sense universal background checks, and even signed legislation allowing children to play with simulated weapons in school.  It is the height of hypocrisy for Scott to call for Christopher Wray's resignation without first offering his own., 7 I was surprised to learn that this sort of thing is even in the FBI\u2019s remit. Is shooting up a school a federal crime? I would have thought this was a matter for the local or state police. After all, it\u2019s not as if Cruz crossed state lines to commit this act. Nor was the school on a federal reservation. Plus I doubt that he what he did counts as terrorism in a strict, politically or religiously motivated sense. , 7 To shift or find blame with local law enforcement and the FBI is a malicious attempt of diversion. More guns more murders. More guns less security. Gun control fewer killings. Not only is the common sense but supported by a large body of evidence.\nA 19 year old can legally purchase a mass killing rifle. And we can estimate that ten thousands of male teenagers do this every year. At that age they still lack impulse control. They take unreasonable risk. And they lack firm judgment of consequences of their actions. Why do we allow them to own any gun? Law enforcement isn\u2019t the problem, laws are., 7 It's rather perverse that politicians -- Scott and Rubio included -- who accept money from the NRA would criticize the FBI.\n\nIsn't it a little early for the politicians and pundits to blame the FBI so quickly, since it's always \"too early\" and \"too insensitive\" to discuss what to do about mass shootings?  , 7 The FBI is a federal agency. The Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 states that the FBI (DOJ) can get involved on request of State and Local authorities. That is the law.\n Did the Police request the FBI to help them? No. Did Rick Scott's Attorney General request help from the FBI? No. No one from local or State requested help from the FBI until after the shooting.\nThe local police went to the Cruz house plenty of times and also on several occasions and had Health Care professional meet them there to assess the mental fitness of Mr.Cruz. They deemed him safe to himself and others. Over and over they reached this conclusion.\nWe had a law on the books that stated people who were mentally unfit could not buy a gun, but there is no indication that it would have stopped Mr.Cruz from buying a gun. because he was deemed safe.\nSemi automatic weapons of any kind do not belong in the hands of civilians. They have the potential to kill too many too quickly. The AR15 allowed Mr.Cruz to kill 17 people and injure 12 and be a mile down the road before first respondents arrived. They need to be banned.\n Yes the laws need to be changed and more funding is needed for the mentally ill but until that happens those semi automatic weapons need to be banned., 7 On the principle that the higher the person is on the leadership ladder in a bureaucracy the greater the responsibility for failures of individuals and methods functioning on the lower steps, Trump should resign for what happened in Florida. Obviously, what Governor Scott is most interested in is covering for Trump on the Mueller investigation and for the NRA and its congressional cronies., 7 Trump and the Broward County Sheriff spent Thursday criticizing teenagers for failing to report strange behavior by the shooter.  \n\nOops!  It was reported.\n\nThe police visited the shooter more than 20 times. \n\n Oops!  Florida, like most states, doesn\u2019t allow police to confiscate weapons preemptively.\n\nGov. Scott and Senator Grassley think that people with mental health issues shouldn\u2019t have guns.  Oops!  Sen. Grassley sponsored a bill, which Trump signed, eliminating restrictions on gun ownership by mentally ill, which Obama had imposed.\n\nIf Wray resigns, Trump, Scott and Grassley should join him.\n\nAnd maybe the editors of The NY Times should join them.  The NY Times does everyone a disservice by tying the missed tip on the Florida shooter with the Republican criticism of the FBI - Mueller probe.\n\nHow are the two connected, other than by Republicans trying to cover for the President?, 7 Governor Scott\u2019s comment is really rich!   He called for FBI director to resign,  nice deflection. Maybe he should resign over his  failure to protect children. , 7 So much for \"If you see something say something\"!, 7 Should every White Supremacist that owns a semi-automatic gun get a \"visit\" from the FBI?  What if they field were narrowed to White Supremacists that engage in military type training?  These people clearly are expressing a desire to kill people, non-whites, Jews, law enforcement, someone. I wonder if Rick Scott would support those type of \"visits\"?, 7 So, the FBI Clown Car fails again, and again that failure contributes to a tragic blood bath. And the Times prints it below the fold. The Establishment Media is so determined to win its war against Trump that it's focus on the hot air of \"Russian interference in the 2016 election\" stifles all reality based conversation.\nIn 80+ years we have rarely witnessed such lap dog infatuation with the G-Man image. The FBI has gotten nearly everything wrong for generations, endangering our democracy at crucial moments in history, yet now we have the spectacle of self defined \"Progressives\" embracing this quasi-secret, quasi-frat house agency., 7 What a horrible person this Ms. Coulter is. Yes the FBA is so busy with Washington to be bothered. Access to guns should be made impossible then., 7 I see a lot of craven, hypocritical cowards holding public office who are perfectly OK with dead kids as long as they're someone else's kids. And I'm saying something., 7 Why in the world would the NYT quote Ann Coulter?   Her observations are in a category with Rush Limbaugh., 7 Perhaps Gov.Scott from fla should resign for allowing AR15s to be purchased in his state!!, 7 Mass shootings aren't the FBI's fault. The are the fault of the NRA and their stooges in congress. They are also the fault of a court that has warped the meaning of that anachronism called the 2nd amendment. , 7 You know why this is happening more now? Because schools teach boys they have a right to be gay and marry boys and even be pregnant in the near future, but they don\u2019t have a right to be husbands or fathers. Congress needs to rule out male pregnancy and female sperm and void all same sex marriages., 7 This headline is inappropriate. Who cares that some reporter says the FBI fumbled. The United States had been fumbling on the murder of its own citizens for decades.\nThe US has fallen into a sphere of violence like many third word countries before it. Take a look at how quickly Australia changed their gun laws. Heads up US -  you are no longer \"first world.\" Tourists need to stop visiting the US cause there is a pretty good chance you will die a violent death. Its about as far from the \"Land of Free\" as you can get. You cannot be a world leader anymore US - you are a horrifying example of stupidity. , 7 Anyone who posted one comment about anything other than  focusing on this horrific mass murder and epic FBI fail is part of the problem. , 7 The NRA\u2019s insistence on everyone\u2019s right to gun ownership is the problem. How about this-mandate that all US households own a handgun,that we all be licensed and trained and in exchange for this, all military grade semi automatic weapons are to be surnenderd and made illegal? Second amendment intact- weapons of mass destruction outlawed. Then let the NRA fanatics argue the need for the AR -15- wonder what insane reason they will present that justifies the continued mass murder of our children!, 7 Twenty calls to the Sheriff's Department and he still had his AR-15. Why is that not the headline?, 7 Make military style assault rifles illegal to possess and the mass killings go away, 7 It goes without saying that we can\u2019t be rememberd as am influential and shining world cultural example when our promising young people are taking bullets! All of these indices show we have turned away from the proper source of fulfillment -to love God with all our mind, souk and strength! We have been twisted from the loving and other-respecting purposes by pkacing the purauit of money and power ahead of true service to country and others (in faithful submission to God)., 7 Scott should resign for all the crazy Florida laws allowing a 19 year old crazy to legally buy an assault rifle and large capacity mags., 7 Press is trying to hide this story as soon as possible, how the 1000 agents in Miami field office are busy chasing phantoms in Siberia to keep Hillary safe, while ignoring a raging armed lunatic in their backyard. No wonder people are getting bullet proof vests, because nothing else will protect them., 7 What about the Sheriffs office of Broward Count receiving 20 calls regarding the shooter over the past few years .  They are local.\nWhere's their accountability?, 7 Rick Scott has an A+ rating with the NRA, he should resign., 7 The F.B.I. is  not responsible for this tragedy. A mentally ill man with an assault weapon is responsible for this tragedy. , 7 Had the FBI brought Cruz in and questioned him what could they have done other than keeping an eye on him. I very much doubt they could have prevented this. However I agree someone did drop the ball at the FBI.\nWhat infuriates me is that Governor Scott has the audacity to call for Wray's resignation his state has some of the most lax laws on guns in the US. No Governor Wray shouldn't resign you should.\nAs for the Republican Congressional members criticising Wray and the FBI how many of you have decline to do anything about gun control because you receive large donations from the NRA? Please you are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites!, 7 Rick Scott is now part of the team bent on ruining the reputation of the FBI.  While it is dismaying that the FBI botched this tip, the answer to the problem is not Rick Scott.  Wake up Florida, take ownership of the gun problem in this state.  Demand action from everyone, Rick Scott and the FBI included , 7 Nobody knows how many reports about suspected crazies the FBI receives.\nNo doubt thousands, daily.  And they too have limited resources.\nWhy was there no security at the school?\nWhy was he able to just walk right in with a rifle and plenty of ammo?, 7 If the administration and others supported the FBI more, gave them the budget and upgrades that they need, instead of attacking them, then maybe this school shooting would have been prevented., 7 In a nation where everyone  can buy whatever type of military grade weapon they please,law enforcement can do only so much.In the rush to blame someone besides the politicians who allow such firearms to be sold we must not lose sight of the enablers.Beware red herrings!!!, 7 The FBI also failed to promptly investigate the Nassar sexual abuse tragedy.  They failed to identify the Boston Bombers despite the fact that the older bomber had been previously jailed.\n\nIt is time to stop making excuses for the FBI's incompetence., 7 \"FUMBLED\" is not the correct word.  They along with the Broward County Sheriff's Office do not ordinary citizens bothering them.  , 7 The governor of Florida should resign for allowing lax gun laws that would allow a teenager to purchase semi automatic weapons.  , 7 Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants Christopher Wray to resign.  Just another Republican trying to  distract us from two real issues--1. the Russia investigation,  and 2. the need for gun control...  , 7 Rick Scott and Marco Rubio want a resignation, an investigation. The FBI made a mistake. A tragic missed opportunity that, I am sure, they will explain fully and make necessary corrections.\nScott and Rubio however, masters of misdirection, who are so deeply in the pockets of the NRA that they would never see the right side of this tragedy. They are the ones who made the sale of this weapon possible. They practically put the killing machine into the hands of Cruz. They and the rest of the republican goons who place school children in the cross-hairs of dangerous weapons every day.\nI fully expect Trump to tweet his support for a resignation, and an investigation, shortly.\nTrump is a republican, the republican party is, and will always be, the party of Trump. The NRA owns the whole rotten gang.\nSchool children and other citizens of the United States continue to die at the hands of nuts with assault weapons.\nState terrorism sanctioned and supported by the republican party. Try misdirecting from that. , 7 Unfortunately, no matter how much the FBI refines its process, there are over 300 million guns in America and an increasing number of disenfranchised individuals... more than a government agency can realistically keep track of. However, there are only 535 congressmen, and these people need to do their job and get these killing machines off the streets and out of our communities!, 7 It begins and ends with legislative gun control. \n\nThe biggest challenge?\n\n Elected officials who put NRA dollars in their pockets. , 7 So, what does the FBI do once it has someone like Cruz in its sights?  They can't arrest him.  That can't take his guns away.  At that point, he hasn't done anything.  What can they do?????, 7 So Gov. Scott calls for FBI chief Wray to resign but says nothing about Broward County sherriff Israel, whose unit received about 20 calls also failed to intercept the shooter. Sounds rather political to me. Perhaps the Governor needs to deal with his own state first. Sherriff Israel states that in the end, \"the only one to blame for this killing is the killer himself\". The killer may be the only person guilty, but society as a whole is responsible, for allowing the shooter to buy an AR-15., 7 Seriously?  We\u2019re going to blame the FBI for seventeen million AR-15\u2019s being sold to the public?, 7 Maybe the FBI should spend less time trying to subvert democracy and frame the Trump administration and more time chasing down bona-fide leads on mass murderers., 7 If Cruz had been Muslim, the FBI probably would have taken the tip seriously. The FBI has gone as far as to entrap Muslims with offers of guns and money when the targets were far less dangerous than Cruz., 7 So many \u201cwould\u2019ve, could\u2019ve, should\u2019ve\u201c comments (and actions by our politicians (hint hint: mop head \u2013 orange head) , but the cops can only do so much to catch the easy to catch criminals\u2026 not looking down on law enforcement, (and especially law and order) Or anything, but that is what our system or democracy is made of And should stand for., 7 No, just no. It makes no sense to pin this on the FBI, other than for the Trump clan of Russian predators to politicize the DoJ. \n\nOther students report that this killer was strange even in middle school - more than a decade ago. Neighbors report the mother and this older adopted son were for yeas a big problem in the upscale neighborhood. Other neighbors made videos of him stepping outside the back door in his underwear shooting a pistol. Seemingly, everyone at this high school knew and expected this crackpot 19-year-old to keep being a wacko.  Yet, he was never monitored, even after expulsion from this school and transfer to another for similar troubled males. Anyone who has spent even 10 minutes on social media is fully cognizant that if we want the federal government to swoop in and arrest every degenerate male who uses the internet to pump his ego and manhood, then we better hire hundreds of thousands more FBI agents and build more prisons - for half the U.S. males that would be then investigated and arrested. Seriously, this is a gun control issue and it is a male issue. America since the 1980s (the 1960s for some groups of males) has defined masculinity as aggressive, predatory and violent, with no room on the edges for anything of the head and heart - just those parts below the waist. This is the same inadequacy issue we see with male attitudes toward females, children, small animals - everything these disassociated malformed guys come in contact with. , 7 What vile wickedness, dishonesty and hypocrisy for these GOP  enablers who attract NRA support by putting military  grade weapons in the hands of millions of Americans and then blame the enforcement authorities when some crazy killer, predictably, slips through the net. When Sessions: says  \u201cIt is now clear that the warning signs were there and tips to the FBI were missed,\u201d he is just trying to deflect attention from responsibility. Sessions is lying in his teeth when he says \u201cWe see the tragic consequences of those failures. And :\u00a0\u201cThe FBI in conjunction with our state and local partners must act flawlessly to prevent all attacks. This is imperative, and we must do better.\u201d He knows full well that, but for GOP gun policy, the slaughter of those innocent children could not have happened., 7 So sorry and sad for the loss. FBI can\u2019t be blamed. Control and ban guns. Period!, 7 I ask, rhetorically, who are the people buying these assault rifles actually afraid of? The Indians? Perhaps Blacks? Maybe the Muslims? But I really think who they're afraid of is their own government (e.g. Ruby Ridge and Waco). These assault rifle buyers are typically the right-wing, white-males who \"support the troops\u201d and the of course \u201clove the police.\" But won\u2019t the same \"troops\" and \"police\" be the enemy who they will ultimately have to fight when the day finally comes to take their guns away and impose this so-called \"New World Order?\" What I find truly ironic is these are the same people who despise the \"unpatriotic\" Colin Kapernick, when he kneels in peaceful, silent protest of the police and the government during the playing of the National Anthem. However, then the same people go buy these \"weapons of mass destruction\" to arm themselves against the same police and the same government as Colin Kapernick peacefully opposes., 7 Rick Scoot, Florida governor, wants the FBI director fired for the agency\u2019s missing the threat of the shootings. He might want to consider if he had a role of his own in what happened. According to Time magazine, Scott \u201cnoted in 2014 that he had signed \u2018more pro-gun bills into law \u2014 in one term \u2014 than any other Governor in Florida history.\u2019\u201d , 7 Let's make a referendum in November to change the constitution on gun control!, 7 The real culprit is the shooter's parents. You might not raise your kid to cure cancer or win an olympic gold medal.  But teaching manners and good behavior is a pretty low bar. So often adoptive kids are spoiled and turn into brats or worse as in this case. Why did the parents not disciple this kid?  , 7 But they indicted several fake Russians.\nKudos for FBI, the weaponized political agency.   , 7 No--actually the root of the problem and the most culpable people are those who become parents carelessly and who during their fertile years treat their own bodies as trash receptacles.\n\nDamaged children like Adam Lanza, Dylann Roof and Nikolas Cruz weren't dropped off by the Tough Luck Fairy.  They are products of prenatal damage and subsequent lousy parenting.  \n\nYes--no one in this country, or anywhere, ought to be able to buy or own semi-automatic weapons.  \n\nBut as a friend observed to me recently--jails in other countries are full of convicted murderers who used knives as their weapons of choice, and we*ve certainly read of mass-murderers rampaging through schools and public areas with nothing more automatic than a knife killing people just as thoroughly as guns do.\n\nMiswired brains are dangerous.  Children with miswired brains in the care of parents unable to provide appropriate nurturing are a time bomb.\n\nLynda Cruz did not do everything possible to raise her adopted children well.  She refused to believe neighbors reporting Nikolas*s acts to her.  She kept replacing the furniture he destroyed and thought calling the police was therapeutic intervention.  But the true criminals are Nikolas*s birth parents., 7 If Governor Rick Scott was a Democrat, the liberals would be calling for the FBI Director, Christopher Wray, to resign.  They would insist upon it.  It is because of their hatred for President Trump that they are going easy on the FBI.  Wasn't it the Democrats who were blaming James Comey, the former FBI Direcfor, for releasing to congress the information about Hillary Clinton's emails just days before the election..  The Dems and liberals have selective outrage.  Such hypocrites., 7 Maybe it is the FBI people in Florida that need to quit.  They are the ones that got the tip and ignored it.  And lets go back to the flight instructor in Florida who tipped off the FBI that he had Middle Eastern students that wanted to learn how to fly but weren't concerned about learning how to land.  His tip was ignored too and as a result we had 9/11., 7 I guess local law enforcement and the Florida State Troopers have no powers to act. /s   Ought not the Governor of Florida resign?, 7 Cruz took an Uber car to the school to start his plan to kill.  He was carrying a soft-sided rifle case with his AR-15 in it.  The Uber driver did not call police.  , 7 So, the FBI was warned, but didn't do its job, right?\n\nSounds familiar, doesn't it?\n\nAny consequences for the FBI ? \n\nSame had happened prior to 9/11, with quite a few leads.\n\nIt is too tragic to entertain a pun, but has anyone heard the Q of \"How many people work for the government?\"\n\nThe answer: half of them., 7 How like the right-wing to use this horror for political purposes, i.e., using it to push for removal of the FBI head and promoting the myth that the shooting was somehow caused by Clinton and Obama who intentionally distracted the FBI by investigating a conspiracy with Russia. , 7 We can talk about Christopher Wray after Mr. Scott has himself resigned and sworn off politics for good.\n\nHaving made Florida lie down and pass out guns like candy, having made murder as easy to walk away from as a speeding ticket, having made none of that matter because his state will be under water soon enough, Mr. Scott is now thoroughly enjoying this latest opportunity to engage in national media histrionics in support of the NRA/Trump Ultimate Distraction Team.\n\nYou may not have seen their motto: \"Do anything. Say anything. Publicly destroy anybody.  Never, ever mention guns.\"  Their logo is a fuzzy waving bunny with a big smile, all pink and white, with \"Thoughts and Prayers, America !!!\" on a banner in the background.  Charming, yes?  Gives one a feeling of really being loved.\n\nStay where you are, Christopher Wray, and make the FBI better.\n\nAnd gets guns off our streets, because you're nearing the point where gun control supporters will be testing the limits of the second amendment for themselves., 7 Gov. Scott with his A+ NRA rating helped put the gun into the hands of the disturbed individual who carried out this hideous crime.  It's no wonder he wants you to think the FBI is somehow culpable., 7 There should have been follow-up on the tip about the school shooter in Parkland, and it is important to find out where a breakdown in F.B.I. protocol occurred and to fix it.\n\nThat being said, the last thing the nation needs is a politicization of another tragic day of gun violence by Attorney General Sessions, Donald Trump, the White House staff and the N.R.A. apologists.\n\nWhat kind of president uses the deaths of 17 people \u2013 mostly children \u2013 to try to divert attention from his own misconduct in dealing with Russian criminals and spies?, 7 I live in Broward, my son attended broward schools from 2004 until 2016. When Sheriff Israel flatly states, \"make no mistake about it, the gunman is the only one to blame\", he's being baldly self-serving, letting himself and his agency off the hook. Broward deputies were called some 2 dozen times on this kid. Why was there no intervention? A neighbor boy assaulted my son, he was put into a months long intervention program and apparently hasn't been in trouble since. But that's thanks to our city police who followed up on our complaint aggressively. What's wrong with the Broward cops? Maybe Sheriff Israel's statement shirking responsibility is part of the problem there. , 7 So, the FBI fumbled one call. How about the numerous calls to Broward Police? No similar outrage?, 7 As a Floridian, I urge Gov. Scott (R) to resign. The NRA in 2014 stated he had signed \u201cmore pro-gun bills into law \u2014 in one term \u2014 than any other Governor in Florida history.\u201d Scott signed the law, passed by his Republican legislature, that made it possible for this kid to buy this rifle. Ask Scott anything about guns, and without fail, he weasels out of answering, which, in fact, is his SOP to any question that does not fit his agenda. This cadaverous scoundrel, who bought the governorship with ill-gotten gains after claiming the 5th amendment over 90 times in a deposition, is more responsible for these deaths than any individual on the planet, and that includes Cruz. , 7 It's \"too soon\" to politicize school murders by talk of gun control... but it's NOT \"too soon\" to politicize them by calling for the ouster of the head of the FBI in order to take heat off Trump. \n\nFunny how that works. , 7 How many people on alt right websites talk about killing?\n\nCan the FBI arrest all of them?   Or how about all of the who own guns?\n\nOr is that against the law which Trump and other Republicans signed allowing anyone age 18 and older to own assault weapons designed to kill dozens of Americans., 7 We dont, as yet, detain suspects on thought crime. What was the FBI to do with a 17 year old?, 7 Really gov Scott?  Just shows that these Trumpsters will use anything to try and derail mullet. At least mr wray and the FBI did something that the Trumpsters and the GOP are completely incapable of, they admitted that they made a mistake, 7 Someone needs to look at Scott's record on gun safety. , 7 Just when you think Ann Coulter can\u2019t go any lower, she manages to do so. , 7 Yes, the FBI should have followed up on the intelligence they had and this could have possibly prevented this terrible tragedy. But why, only in the USA, is it illegal for someone under 21 to buy alcohol but they can buy an array of assault weapons and killing tools. All politicians and government personnel who oppose gun control are complicit in not doing their job and are fostering this kind of violence., 7 As soon as every Republican in Congress who has blindly followed the NRA's talking points resigns, I'll agree that the FBI director should resign., 7 There are tens of thousands of people who are just as demented and sick as this youngster and many of them have been posting their anger and twisted emotions on all kinds of websites.  Only a few of the most extreme have come to the attention of the FBI and they put them on watch lists.  But until there is more done to help the mentally ill get the help they need, the best we can do is to keep them from getting lethal weapons capable of massacring so many people in so little time.\n How many more massacres before the public makes it impossible for people to get elected who will not do more to protect us from these self-inflicted disasters.  The film industry is to blame as well.  Why do we have so much entertainment rife with violence and the glorification of violence?, 7 Dear Editor,\n  Please provide a list of all members of Congress and the Senate who have taken money from the NRA, and include the amount.  These employees of the American people are not allowed to offer condolences and prayers to these devasted families, friends, and the entire community.  The only decent thing they have to offer is their immediate resignations.\n   All remaining must elected employees must begin the hard work to reform America's weapons policies.  They must also be charged to install methods where people known to be a danger can be treated and the public safeguarded.   The monies for mental health that President Reagan eliminated must be restored.\n     Law enforcement must be better funded and tasked with investigating threats to public safety, and not be decimated by partisanship.   Public safety should be more important than nabbing our local pot puffer.\n   All Americans must assume the role our founding fathers designed for us.  We are the employers of elected officials and must demand these corrections and changes and hold elected officials accountable.\n  It starts with me., 7 I'm just glad that I live in a country(the only country) where an 18 year old (or 16 year old) can easily kill a whole lot of people if he wakes up in a bad mood or has a bad day or headache or anything like that. , 7 Republicans love, Love, LOVED the FBI when it announced 'new information' on Hillary's emails two weeks before the election.  But when it's their guy being investigated the FBI is a bunch of hacks.  Republicans want to politicize institutions that should be non-partisan; they are out of control.\n\nIgnore what Republicans say and vote them out as soon as possible. They are the biggest threat America is facing today., 7 To those who ask why in the USA but not elsewhere, the answer is not just gun availability. It is a culture obsessed with fantasy, violence and contempt for authority. Unhappy/unsound people are told by billboards throughout Florida that if they are injured/distraught they should call a lawyer and get revenge - someone is responsible and must pay. Vengefulness and narcissism is the new creed - and that message now comes from the very top. It is part of the same cultural illness as Trumpism. , 7 I have software that can track a piece of spam backwards through 10 different countries yet the FBI with all of its sophisticated network couldn't back track an entry to the bail bondsman? Any ISP would be more than happy to give the path and the person who sent the email to the FBI.\nSomeone just didn't care enough to thorough on this at the FBI. J. Edgar Hoover must be spinning in his grave (in his tutu) seeing what has happened to the great investigative service he built., 7 Why have all these Republicans become such stooges for Trump? In normal times can you imagine any Republican voicing even a hint of criticism of any law enforcement organization, much less the FBI? , 7 Even an anonymous tip about a potential shooter must be followed thru.\n\nA very deep investigation is necessary here, and I believe jail time is also necessary for those employed by the FBI that let these children die by their own inaction., 7 By that logic, Governer Scott should also resign.  His policies and beliefs failed to protect these young people, his school system failed to secure itself, and his law enforcement agencies failed to properly classify the shooter as mentally ill. \n\nit is also telling that Russia is spreading pro-gun propaganda in the US. They must believe it will have a destabilizing influence on our social fabric.\n\nSomehow, we can't solve a problem that every other civilized country has solved., 7 Time for a national referendum on the 2nd Amendment: what does it mean, what is it for, is it relevant, do we need or want it?, 7 Before Rick Scott and Marco Rubio demand FBI resignations why don't they discuss the extreme ease with which assault weapons and other guns are available in Florida?    \n\nBoth men, and the NRA, are as guilty as Nikolas Cruz for the latest school tragedy. They and their Republican colleagues are all complicit in these murders.  Placing blame elsewhere is their collective effort to muddle and cloud their own responsibility for this latest massacre.    \n\nThey are grifters and hypocrites caring more for campaign contributions than for the welfare and safety of children and their own constituents. , 7 Every male between 18 and 45 in Switzerland is in the army reserve, and has a fully automatic military rifle and ammunition in his home.\nThe adult population of Israel is almost fully armed, many with automatic weapons and the ammunition right at hand.\nThere are no mass school killings in either country.\nThere is no need for such arming in the USA, but that is not the real cause of these shootings.\nLook at the real cause.\nEvery one of these shooters was a young male raised without a father in the home. There is a socialization needed to make male children into functioning adults. Fathers provide it. All of these shooters lacked it.\nThere's your problem., 7 You can point the finger, Governor Scott, at the FBI, but Florida has some of the weakest gun laws in the country.  And what is this, calling for a newly appointed FBI director to resign?  What is your motive in that I wonder?  Heads should roll at the Florida FBI offices involved, but let's not lay the blame where it does not belong., 7 Maybe we throw out all the GOPers who don\u2019t act, instead. That might be a better start than blaming the FBI who is obviously understaffed and over-worked. , 7 I was taken aback by Governor Rick Scott's call for the director of the FBI to resign.  Yes, a tragic error was made in follow-up by the bureau, but I look at all the conservative fury with a bit of skepticism.  How many conservative Republicans called upon President George W. Bush to resign, after it emerged that he had received a warning about Osama bin Laden wanting to strike the U.S. with airplanes in one of his security briefings?  I don't recall any conservatives upset about that breakdown.  Yes, he made a mistake, just as the FBI made an error in judgment as well.  But enough with the self-righteous anger!, 7 The FBI has fewer employees than the NYPD - and they cover the whole country.  So how are they to follow up on every crazy call they get?  Also, there is no law that would have allowed the FBI or local law enforcement to take away Cruz\u2019s weapon.  None.  So we can start there and ask Governor Scott why that is...- Florida\u2019s gun laws are the reason these atrocities occur.  They will continue to occur until Floridians elect people willing to change the law and control assault weapons. , 7 We have this same national conversation after every mass shooting. Everyone expresses shock and disbelief. Everyone talks about what needs to be done. Politicians grandstand. Time passes. Nothing gets done. This will happen again..and again...and again. Americans just become more and more desensitized to this issue. Nothing gets done. , 7 How is it that the local police knew about Cruz and did not contact the local FBI office?\n\nThis is a failure at all levels of law enforcement and it starts with the local police. , 7 GOP politicians are abdicating their responsibility for gun control and violence and are now blaming law enforcement in stead. Grow up and do your duty.\nGovernment is for the people not against., 7 Yeah, right. Blame the FBI and blame mental health when the REAL guilty element is the total lack of gun control!\nIn addition, with the \"elimination\" of the Affordable Care Act, how can people pay for mental health care.\nAmerican taxpayers are paying a fortune out of their pockets for protection of Trump and all his family members. His daughter-in-law opens a packet of [harmless] powder and everybody comes running. Seventeen kids get killed and all the President and Congress can offer are \"prayers\".\nShouldn't the President and Congress be concerned about teenagers/future voters who are fed up with nothing being done about this situation? Why not follow Australia's example?, 7 Are we really going to blame the proliferation and easy accessibility of military assault rifles in our society on our law enforcement???  REALLY!!!  Let's talk about all the potential mayhem our law enforcement has prevented with intervention too.  I blame our lethal weapon happy society for not enacting more gun bans or laws restricting the sale possession and use of military assault weapons along with State and local politicians for not protecting us from such mayhem.  There's lots of blame to go around.  , 7 As the son of a retired FBI agent I\u2019m disturbed and dismayed by the times in recent history when the Agency has had the goods somewhere in the organization, but failed to act.  The worst example that is oft forgotten is the female agent in Minneapolis who was suspicious of all the mid eastern men were getting flight training.  she sent this info to DC where in got lost in the mix.  Thousand of Americans died in America\u2019s worst terrorist attack. Then add the instances cited in this article and any conclusion short of a total reboot of the agency is naive.  And it can\u2019t take months or years, it must start Monday.  , 7 Unless you are willing to substitute preventive detention for Constitutional protections, what exactly was the FBI or any police organization to do?  The failure here was not the police's, but our elected officials who permitted this mentally unstable individual to purchase and possess an assault weapon.\nThis outcry, especially from Gov Scott, is nothing more than a blatant attempt to avert attention from his complicity in this latest massacre. , 7 The fact that the F. B. I.  failed to act on a tip about the shooter is awful. The individual responsible should be held accountable and will most likely be fired.\n\nSo Rick Scott thinks that Christopher Wray should resign because someone in the bureau made a tragic mistake. The same Rick Scott who is governor of a state that allows eighteen year olds who can't purchase beer the ability to purchase assault weapons? What a hypocrite!, 7 Yes, this needs to be investigated, but I agree with other people who are saying the FBI   cannot be held solely responsible for not preventing this massacre. Governor Scott should look at his own role in this before he tells anyone else to resign: On his watch we've had the shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport, 49 people killed in Orlando, and now 17 people killed at a high school. This isn't just a national problem, it's a state problem, and  Florida has incredibly lax gun laws.  Open carry, no waiting period for purchasing an AR-15? Maybe it's time for a boycott of the Florida tourist industry until they clean up their act; it might save your life., 7 I wonder in all this, what the responsibility of parents with troubled kids is. Would it have made a difference if his parents had gone to the police about their child? Would local forces have been able to monitor him better? How about school authorities, could they have taken complaints seriously and involved local police who could have assessed the situation better, more easily and adviced the FBI?\nHow can an FBI act on an abstract problem with probabilistic outcomes? It\u2019s all so easy to blame it on the FBI, if they started aggressively following all tips, then there would be a hue and cry about infringement of rights. This has got to be acted on at a personal and neighborhood level. One cannot sit at home afraid or ashamed of your family member when there are many other lives at stake.  Perhaps he could have been forcibly admitted into a psychiatric ward where professionals could have given clarity to his obviously deranged mind. We need to become Americans first, even before family....., 7 Reading these comments makes me sad at the amount of adults who are so bogged down in ideology.  It is possible for 2 things to be true at the same time.  The shooter is of course at fault while this is unquestionably one of the biggest failures in FBI history.  Several people in leadership need to step down if they allowed procedure to get so lacks that something like this is possible., 7 An indictment doesn't prove anything.  It's just a charge.  The allegations have to be proven in Court.  Mr. Mueller could have sealed the indictments, hoping some of the Russians would come here and answer the charges.  Instead he named everyone he charged and thereby warned them all against ever coming here.  Mr. Mueller has multiple unproven charges that he has no interest in proving.  He has told us what he thinks in the indictments and has chosen not to prove any of them.  Unproven facts in court are worth nothing.  Mr. Mueller hasn't advanced his case at all.  This is little more than an empty exercise and it is not worth a hill of beans., 7 Using Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law as a reference point, I say to Christopher Wray, Stand Your Ground!  This is not the time to resign under pressure from demagogues in Florida and elsewhere in our Country.  If anything, your presence at The Bureau will help to maintain confidence and constancy.  If the person who appointed you has other ideas about your future, let him decide., 7 You\u2019re not interested in guns, and I\u2019m not interested in alcohol.   I\u2019ll give up my (constititionally protected, sometimes useful) guns entirely if you give up your (completely not protected, totally useless) alcohol entirely.  \n\nAlcohol kills more than guns do by a long, long shot. No pun intended. 100,000 a year to about 10,000 a year. \n\nIf you\u2019re really interested in saving lives (which you\u2019re not), let\u2019s make a deal (which you wouldn\u2019t).  \n\nRemember this now, you give up alcohol, you can have my guns.  Otherwise, stuff it.  , 7 Let's not forget that President John F Kennedy's assassin was on the radar of the FBI before he killed.  The perpetrators of 9/11 were on the radar before they acted.  Being \"on the radar\" does not always equal being stopped.  Sometimes there is simply not enough evidence, under our laws, to act.  And then there is simply human error, going with one priority over another, always glaringly obvious in hindsight.  , 7 You want a gun - you get licensed and register the gun and yes pay a nominal fee for insurance., 7 NYTimes, please don\u2019t quote the likes of Ann Coulter in an otherwise well written article about such a serious issue facing our country. She is a TV talking head, not a politician, government official or a specialist with educated knowledge of these issue. Editorials or opinion pieces are fine for referencing the comments of an Ann Coulter, not the hard news article about the mass murder of children., 7 This administration is historically hostile to the FBI which is terrible for the morale of the Bureau. Of course they should still do their job (and do) but it shouldn't be discredited as a fact. If they weren't hot on the trail of Russia meddling with our elections with the former director being very publicly fired maybe the administration would offer some support.\nThe fact that anyone is worried that a few tips slipped by when the gun culture in this country is at a constant fever pitch is absurd. If the FBI had acted successfully on both tips and stopped the shootings we'd never hear of them (or they would be a small story). The body count attributable to the NRA and its followers due to their owning so many lawmakers outright is the real scandal. School shooters are so common now that they barely elicit notice unless you have young kids or are in an affected community. The NRA and gun-rights supporting GOP members shoulder much more blame than the FBI. At least the Bureau is trying to stop mass murder and succeeds most of the time! The AR-15 and other guns will increase in sales in the coming week as they always do post high profile shooting. , 7 The NYT prints news from all over the world. No where else in the world I remember reading about people going to their current or old school and killing people or even harming people. People go to their old schools usually to thank their teachers, not to kill everybody. At about the time the Parkland case was happening, a grandmother in Washington State has foiled similar preparation by her grandson. This seems to be a unique U.S. phenomenon and something has overtaken American psyche, and is getting worse.\n\nSince ancient times, India has celebrated once a year 'Guru Purnima' day, that is the day students pay respects to their teachers. It follows Lunar Calendar and is always on a full moon day some time in June. May be the U.S. schools can start annual 'Thank your School' day also., 7 There are 35,000 active FBI agents and some 320 million Americans.  These agents, like any other law enforcement agency can't get it right every single time.  Just like Amtrak employees, lawyers, doctors, contractors and people in other industries make mistakes, so does the FBI.  And it's not their fault congress refuses to act on reasonable gun control.  There is no civilian use for an AR-15.  So when congress does nothing to recognize this and refuses to act, suddenly it's the fault of the FBI?  \n\nGovernor Rick Scott thinks the Director of the FBI should resign.  This is the same guy that wants to run for the Senate and during his own encounter with law enforcement involving his failed, criminal healthcare company he took the Fifth Amendment some 70 times.  And Republicans made him the Governor.  It's laughable.  How about you resign Rick.  You don't talk too much about your program of drug testing public assistance recipients which was a dismal failure since 98% of them were drug free.  Of course us taxpayers paid for that folly.    \n\nAnd since you're on the Trump Train anyway your presence in the US Senate will just add to the problem we now have with congress a so afraid of the NRA they'll do exactly what they're told.  \n\nIf congress would enact sane gun control legislation guys like the Florida shooter couldn't acquire AR-15's that have no purpose but to kill as many people in the shortest period of time.  \n\nLeave the FBI alone and look to congress for the solution., 7 Yes, the tip should have been passed on to the field office for action, but what would they have done?  The FBI spoke to the Boston Marathon bombers before that attack.  If no law was broken, all the FBI could do was give the kid a stern talking to.  Maybe that would have done some good, maybe not.  , 7 If the FBI is negligent then Trump is equally negligent because Trump rescinded President Obama\u2019s executive order that prevented the mentally ill from acquiring guns., 7 Ask Governor Scott why it is illegal for nineteen year olds to buy alcohol in Florida but legal to buy a AR-15 rifle, a killing machine. And Senator Rubio, who has received over three million dollars in campaign contributions from the NRA. Their policies allowed Nikolas Cruz to purchase a gun that has been used in five of the six recent mass shootings. These weapons have to be banned. There are NO good reasons for civilians to own them. None at all, only heartbreak and tragedy, over and over again. , 7 What exactly were the fbi supposed to do about it? What non existent gun laws could they have enforced to stop a disturbed man who says disturbing things from buying an ar15 in Florida?\n\nThis doesn't happen in the UK, and it's not because we don't have evil people or mental illness here. , 7 Sure, guns are a problem. But the real problem is stupid people (Americans) with guns. And I don\u2019t think anything will solve that., 7 For Governor Scott to call for the firing of Wray is the height of hypocrisy considering the number of complaints in Broward County about the shooter over the last several years.   Perhaps Scott should offer his resignation and remove himself from all leadership positions.  , 7 Another reason why American schools and American students are tops in the world! Go America!, 7 Rick Scott's suggestion that Christopher Wray resign is absurd.  If anyone in the FBI is held accountable it should be the agent(s) who failed to follow through on their tips.\n\nIf anyone is to be held accountable, it is Rick Scott with Marco Rubio a close second.  The NRA has funded both of their campaigns.  I'm sick of hearing that the guns aren't the problem, the person is the problem.  Of course the person is the problem but without the gun - guess what - the consequences of actions by unbalanced people would be markedly less severe.\n\nAnd let's not forget the famous \"stand your ground\" law.  All of the legislators in FL should be ashamed of that piece of garbage - it's legislated killing as long as you have a \"reason\".  Sure., 7 How active are military recruiters in that school?  Did the military ask for information on students there? Did they try to recruit the shooter?  Did they target the shooter for recruitment?, 7 It is the NRA and its many adherents to a libertarian interpretation of the Second Amendment that perpetuate the violence that slaughtered these kids. When personal pride, self defense, and security from a deep state controlling government is assured through gun ownership, then violence is inevitable, the ultimate expression of true justice. Some may call it vigilante justice, but it is perceived justice all the same. My bet is Cruz felt betrayed or shamed by this school, found confidence and support from his white nationalists brethren, and exercised his right to vengeance. A 'suicide bomber' of the white nationalist type. \n\nLimiting access to guns would make it harder to perform such deeds. But true change must come from shaming gun use and gun ownership. It must become a source of weakness rather than pride, always a form of crime and never justice, a tool outlawed not because it is a tool that can harm, but because it is a tool whose primary role is to perpetrate evil. Until our culture stops deifying the gun neither the law, nor the certainty of future carnage, will change., 7 This was no doubt a horrible mistake, but it was a mistake.  Everyone, including the FBI, makes them.  Sometimes these mistakes, as in this case, have horrific consequences.  I believe it is a great institutional quality to admit such mistakes, and I would point out that no politician in this country-- especially Governor Scott and President Trump-- have ever admitted to doing anything wrong ever, even though they obviously do so on a regular basis.  The only way anyone improves and does better is by first plainly admitting their mistakes and endeavoring to do better going forward.  When you think about it, this is how the governed really want their leaders and institutions to behave.\nIt seems that many in our nation for some reason believe that 100% security is actually possible when it isn't.  Gun violence is seemingly an intractable problem.  Maybe the best way to solve the problem is for all of us, on both sides of this issue, to admit that we have no idea what the solution is., 7 Christopher Wray is not at fault. Rather, corrupt largely Republican minions of the NRA like Rick Scott are at fault. Legislation to address gun-related mass murder will occur only if venal self-serving politicians like Mr. Scott are voted out of office and replaced by better individuals. Men like Mr. Scott, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump don\u2019t care about this problem, only about currying favor with the gun lobby, feeding their base, and getting re-elected. Thus their predictably hollow expressions of sorrow, pious declarations of prayer, and unwillingness to take any meaningful action, while this seemingly endless uninterrupted cycle of uniquely American mass murder continues unabated., 7 We, as a nation, still will not deal with our national shame, our failure to enact reasonable limitations on the types of weapons civilians can purchase and own. Scott's demand is nothing more than a convenient political deflection to avoid his own blame and, oh yes, probably getting him points with Trump. Neither the police or the FBI should be asked to assess and determine the mental stability of citizens., 7 The scary thing is that the \"discussion\" on gun control is one side saying the answer is fewer guns, vs the other side saying the only answer is MORE guns. And one side translates \"common sense gun control\" to mean \"gun grab\". , 7 And what part does the governor play in all of this. What does he owe to the NRA? The FBI MIGHT have been able to keep him under surveillance and maybe not. There are just too many guns and too many people who own them who shouldn't., 7 Not passing the tip to the Miami F.B.I. field office is inexcusable. Same for the sheriff's office not going after the guy after 20 calls received. What was he waiting for? , 7 Who's telling the FBI Director to resign? Is it the same Rick Scott who has been governor during some of the worst mass shootings in his state in US history and who proposed no legislation to address them whatsoever? The one who presides over a state where is is easier to buy an AK47 than it is to buy beer? Who was praised by the NRA's Political Victory Fund who said, 'Rick has signed more pro-gun bills into law in one term than any other governor in Florida?\" The one whose former company, Columbia/HCA, pleaded guilty to 14 felonies and agreed to a $600+ million fine for systematically overcharging the government...that Rick Scott?, 7 How many times must we argue about putting a band-aid on our collective terminal cancer?\nAbolish the 2nd Amendment!\nNo more manufacture, distribution, sale, nor ownership of firearms in our Nation. No individual, nor government agency, nor military are exempt.  No more guns!\nYes, this nation may well engage itself in a civil war (again) as a result of such bold action, however in the the long term, our children will not only survive, but in fact be in a genuine position to create a peaceful future for our nation and engender peace throughout the world., 7 I'm an architect.  Rule 1: When designing a building, allow for tolerances. \n\nUnder normal wear and tear, nothing fits together perfectly year in and year out. \n\nThat's as true for things requiring coordination between people as it is for the many parts of a building.\n\nAny communication system that doesn't allow for -- indeed, expect -- error is terribly poorly designed. \n\nAny communication system on which lives depend should be failsafe -- i.e., have 3-4 layers of safeguards against different kinds of miscommunication. \n\nWe needs layers of safeguards against gun violence in America.\n\nOne layer should be gun control. \n\nPoliticians who don't get it are, I think, engaging in professional malpractice.  , 7 Now now let\u2019s hang this one on the FBI.  Another red herring.\n\nEveryone wants to understand the wherefores and whys of all these shootings.  Analyze this, analyze that.  It\u2019s simple. Guns are readily available to just about anyone who has the money and desire to get one.  Republicans and the NRA don\u2019t want to stop it because it means eliminating the guns.   Unlike the rest of the world, that\u2019s a No Go in the US.   Why all the hand wringing over this?  We know what the problem is and what the solution is.  Not enough people have the power and money to stop it.   So it will go on.  It\u2019s all quite simple.  Either do something about it or accept it.  Apparently we\u2019ve chosen to accept it., 7 As a former Newtown, CT resident, I think it is shameful to use this terrible tragedy for political purposes as Governor Scott and Attorney General Jeff Sessions are doing. Have they no sense of moral decency?, 7 This is pure speculation on my part but here it goes:\nThe FBI was informed about Cruz's hate, guns, killing fantasy, frightening social media.  I wondered why a red flag was not raised. What was the final profile issue the FBI required or seemed ultra sensitive too? What if the white suspect was instead of middle eastern heritage with a name of Masood or?\nWas the agent filtering this call guilty of selectively screening, aka profiling?, 7 Wray should resign. As the head of the FBI, he is ultimately responsible for the bureau not taking action on these two explicit warnings., 7 What can the FBI legally do with a tip like the one called in?  We need more investigative reporting about their options to stop a potential killing.  What can they do until a crime is actually committed?, 7 Thank you to the perceptive people commenting here about this \"huh?\" article.  As many point out, everything the guy did was legal.  I don't see anything at all in the article about what the FBI could have done anyway.  Are we now supposed to have \"guilty until proven innocent\"?  NYTimes, next time you complain about having every U.S. citizen under surveillance, please refer to this article that goes thud.  It's the ocean of guns that is the issue and a law enforcement service that faces the ensuing tidal wave., 7 Marco Rubio, especially, does not have a leg to stand on regarding school shootings until he returns the $3 million in NRA money that he has received over the years.\n\nThe NRA OWNS him, lock, stock and barrel; just as they do most of the Congress. This pernicious hold the NRA has over our government has got to come to an end. The NRA does not represent the people, nor do they exist to 'protect the Second Amendment'. They exist as a mouthpiece and lobbying arm of the gun manufacturers. Even a majority of their members do not agree with the positions the leadership of the NRA takes.\n\nTime to take them down. A nice, sweet RICO indictment might just do it., 7 This shooter was prohibited from carrying a backpack on school grounds because the administration was afraid he would do something like this. Why in the world would a teenager who can't be trusted with a backpack at school be able to buy an AR-15 in fifteen minutes? How in the world did the FBI get multiple tips about Nickolas Cruz being a potential mass shooter and yet fail to find out that he had been banned from carrying a backpack on school grounds because everyone was concerned he would do this?  That we need better gun control does not excuse the FBI for sleeping on the job.  Conversely, that the FBI was sleeping on the job, does not mean that we do not need better gun control.  Let's start by raising the age to buying a semiautomatic rifle to 21. , 7 No blame should be laid on the FBI.  Until this 19 year old actually did something, there was no reason under current gun legislation to prevent him from buying a weapon of mass destruction.  These guns should be considered weapons of mass destruction.  The people who use them should be considered terrorists and treated as such.  , 7 One of the reasons why the FBI failed to \"follow up\" was that they would be accused of suppressing the rights of Americans to own firearms.  , 7 The FBI is not a solution to the problem generally, nor likely in this case. Investigating every angry young man who is called out is a fools errand.  The answer is clear: automatic, or semi-automatic convertible to automatic rifles are inherently dangerous and it should be illegal to buy or sell them.  The government should sponsor a program to buy them back.  In DC v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that there was a right to keep a registered handgun for use in the home.  It also upheld the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. It is not difficult to conclude than an AR-15 is one of those, so ban them as a matter of federal law.  Registering and monitoring the mentally ill, making the FBI responsible for investigating complaints of dangerous youths, or offering thoughts and prayers is no protection--no remedy at all.  Of course reasonable people can use and own an AR-!5, but public safety requires other wise because such weapons are inevitably available to unreasonable people.  And the Constitution allows the Congress the power to ban such dangerous weapons to protect the public safety., 7 Do we really want the FBI to start crawling all over everyone who posts something distasteful (that isn't a specific threat) or people who tipsters say are bad people w/o a specific accusation? This is slippery slope stuff. Thought police. If law enforcment is encouraged to detain and harass people thy suspect might be capable of violence some day... well, I sure wouldn't want to be a young black man in the USA.\n\nIt's not the FBI that caused this. It's the perpetrator, aided by his easy access to a weapon of war. We can't fix people but we can fix access to weapons designed for killing multitudes. , 7 Buying any AR--15 assault weapon \"legally\" shows how corrupt and destructive law can be. How totally uninterested in human life. What effect did  Sandy Hook have on congress? Nothing but extending the sale of AR-15s as far as possible. The same will be true here again. Many will mouth prayers and sell more assault weapons. \n\nAre the Congress and president not accessories to mass murder?, 7 I have to ask, suppose the FBI sent two agents to talk with him. One a psychologist trained for this situation. And he just said, \"I'm fine, my buddy Tim is mad at me and wanted to connect 2+3 and make 4\".\nWhat next?\nThere is no next. He is a US citizen, who hasn't committed a crime, who has a legal right to own a combat weapon, as many magazines, and bullets as he wants. He can't be locked up, since thinking is not a crime.\nSo what more do we learn about the situation other than someone called the FBI? Nothing.\nFor now, at least, American citizens can't be locked up for what someone thinks they are thinking., 7 The question should be asked, and investigated:\n\nWas the decision not to follow up on this tip influenced by the Trump Administration's decision last year to de-emphasize monitoring of white supremacist hate groups,  such as the so-called \"Republic of Florida\" militia that the shooter has been linked to?, 7 It is clear that school shootings are a tragic problem unique to America. There is no precedent. The way to end these horrific events forever will need to be unique as well...drawing on brilliant minds, institutions and resources.  , 7 So it appears the FBI somehow let a warning slip by them. Is it possible that staff is distracted & demoralized by the unrelenting undermining of the public's confidence in the agency by the \"president\"? Who's to say?, 7 So Rick Scott wants the FBI director to resign. This is the same Rick Scott who wanted to run and hide when asked if it made sense for a teenager to be denied the right to buy a cold beer but not an assault weapon.\n\nThis attack on the FBI is in the early stages. Soon this tragic mistake will be used as further evidence of the `deep state.' There will be those who claim the FBI deliberately withheld the information, allowing the attack to materialize, in an effort to damage the Trump administration and its allies at the NRA.\n\nDon't laugh., 7 Maybe if the FBI was not wasting their energy on the bogus Trump collusion investigation, they would have been able to focus on protecting our precious school children., 7 The R's will exploit any situation that comes their way to get the head of the FBI fired. What a coincidence that such a manipulative move would come on the same day Mr. Mueller starts to hand indictments. How curious! , 7 The fact that a number of students singled a kid out to be a school shooter should elicit a dialogue about the effects of isolation, especially in adolescents. \n\nIndeed, the self-sufficient human is subhuman. And subhumans behave just as you imagine they would: devoid of reason, empathy, compassion, etc. Reach out to these people before your inaction prompts their action., 7 In an alternate universe the FBI could have done something to this guy because he was stockpiling weapons. But not this one. No, here we encourage people to buy as many guns as they can get their hands on.\n\nIt's pretty disingenuous for Mr. Scott that he's a member of the party who fights tooth and nail to prevent reasonable gun laws from being enacted and then points the finger of blame at anyone other than himself., 7 I find it OBSCENE that these politicians are jumping on the train of blaming the FBI with extreme solutions (start firing people, of course), when almost none of them is even mentioning the need to discuss legislation to do something about the availability of guns, especially automatic weapons. It's a transparent ruse to focus attention elsewhere than where it should be focused, and it shows just how much respect (none) they have for the \"American people\" a phrase that they simply cannot use often enough to justify their words/actions. Disgusting. But what else is new, especially in this arena., 7 I think the bigger problem here is why Columbine happened and so many of these shootings are in schools:  bullying.  It's out of control, it leaves emotional scars.  Too many people admire these bullies, and some even elect them to public office., 7 The NRA Republicans now have a new talking point. After being stuck on \"now is not the time\" and \"treat mental illness\" they can finally move the discussion off of gun control. As if. This shooter bought his gun legally, nothing changes that. The shooter killed not the FBI. But now Republicans can blame the FBI and not the easy access to a weapon. Because often there is no tip, that's not a fail safe. And maybe they stopped a dozen others. The FBI failure can be looked into at the same time as working on reasonable gun control measures such as better background checks, gun show sales without background check, teenagers gaining access to assault weapons and special approval for large amounts of ammunition. \n\nI can't say I'm surprised at the speed and intensity of the Republicans finding a way out of doing their job of protecting the public. It's supposed to be a team effort but they choose to not participate., 7 The FBI dropped the ball again.  It is time for a thorough housecleaning of this once fine law enforcement agency.  Herbert Hoover must be turning over in his grave to see what has become of the FBI which had such a stellar reputation years ago.  If a thorough investigation had been conducted with the information it had been provided, 17 lives might not have saved., 7 The GOP will stop at nothing to get rid of ethical leadership of the FBI. There is no way Chris Wray should resign over this. Maybe other people should, depending on how it was handled, but we need Wray to stay right where he is, telling the truth to Congress and holding the FBI steady. The GOP's attacks on him and the FBI are increasingly desperate and shameless., 7 Public: If you see something, do something.\nFBI: If you're tipped-off about something, just pretend you weren't.\n\nYeah, that's pretty easy to say, and it may be true in this case. We'll have to see. But in general, it comes down to what we the public are willing to tolerate, on the one hand, and what we're unwilling to demand, on the other. If we're willing to accept a police state, then the FBI would be so beefed-up, well funded and aggressive that all potential threats would be off the street; and if we're unwilling to demand sensible gun laws (or unable to accept that they're currently senseless), then this madness will continue to be the poster child for our country's moral failures.\n\nBut even a far more vigilant FBI than the current one, assuming it fell short of the oppressive measures of a police state organ, would fail to catch every mass shooter under the current gun laws.\n\nGuns don't kill people. Unhinged people with unhindered access to guns kill people., 7 Relying on other\u2019s to recognize, manage and control someone else\u2019s begavior is a recipe for disaster. THat is why safeguards are put in place for public safety. So, the solution is not to expect every report to be successful, and most gun murderers will never be reported in advance, the solution is to remove the murder weapon from public circulation. Blaming the victims, agencies, and everyone except the SYSTEM is a copout and intended to avoid real change.  , 7 Up to the point that he pulled the trigger he had committed no crime so neither the Sheriff nor the FBI could have arrested this young man for thinking about a crime. The real crime here remains the easy access to assault weapons., 7 There's plenty of blame to go around including the local police who responded to his house 39 times, not just the FBI.  And let's not forget that this same Governor who is asking for the FBI head to resign is the same guy who has done nothing given the multiple mass shootings that has happened in his state.  He should himself resign., 7 \u201c'The public expects the F.B.I. to keep them safe and in the overwhelming majority of the instances, the F.B.I. does just that,\u201d said Lauren C. Anderson, a former top F.B.I. official in New York.\"\n\nAnd how do we know that? The FBI had TWO tips that Cruz was going to shoot someone. And someone in the Bureau chose to ignore it.\n\nMs. Anderson \"also said that the past 18 months have been extremely difficult for the F.B.I. and that people should still have confidence in the bureau.\"\n\nAnd why should we? The Bureau doesn't even investigate a tip from a person close to Cruz?! The least it could have done was to interview Cruz to get his history and to warn the high school from which he had been expelled to take extra precautions. The FBI has no excuses, just a massive amount of incompetence.\n\nThe best story I read today is encouraging our nation's 3 million teachers to stage a walk-out until our do-nothing Congress develops a backbone, stands up to the despicable NRA, and passes rational gun control laws that every other developed nation in the world has. My daughter who has a STEM degree was thinking about teaching high school. We are strongly encouraging her to look at other options., 7 In a year that has seen an ongoing campaign of phony accusation against the FBI, we now have a real and very tragic failure of process. Catastrophic as this communication collapse was, something remains puzzling:\n- The school decides to expel gunman after (i'm sure numerous) behavioural incidents.\n- Fellow students had expressed concerns on school grounds.\n- The local PD had been to his home countless times (per local account)\n- But The FBI is to blame for overlooking 2 tips?\nIf the school district admins and local PD don't have a channel of communications in cases like these, there's a much bigger issue. What happen to the GOP clarion call for local government?\nAnd in a sigh of relief, said GOP talking heads (and NRA i'm sure) who have an out on gun control counterarguments, are now demanding FBI resignations? Unreal. , 7 Cruz's accomplices in this mass murder were Trump. Rubio and Scott.  They might as well have passed loaded ammo clips to him as he executed children.  For Scott to call for Christopher Wray to resign is ironic.  Scott has done nothing to make Florida residents safer from gun violence.  Just the opposite.  If anyone should resign in shame it is Scott, Rubio and Trump.  They are the enablers of violent murderers and the ease with which guns are acquired in this country, especially states like Florida.  Shame on them., 7 All of the family members of past shootings should be outraged at the easy access to AR -15 and all other assault rifles.  As a past NRA member, I once received a call from them wondering why I was no longer a member. Growing up with hunting rifles and target pistols I told them that these war weapons have no place in a hunters arsenal. The NRA seems to think that we need these weapons to protect us from the government or an invasion from south of the border into our country.  Please investigate how Sweden and Australia have lowered the number of deaths by gun in their countries.  We are an embarrassment to the civilized world when we are more concerned at the polls about who is pro-life and vote to support those candidates while they do nothing to protect us against\nmassacres on a weekly basis., 7 It is well to remember that Rick Scott was the founder and CEO of Columbia Health when it stole hundreds of millions of dollars from taxpayers with fraudulent billing.  Despite his leadership position, Scott maintained that he had no responsibility for the theft whatsoever.  And now he demands that the FBI director step down after a blown tip opportunity?  Only a profoundly cynical human being could make such a demand given his own shameful leadership history.   , 7 Pointless blaming the FBI or expecting law enforcement to prevent gun carnage. Every American owning a gun is a potential threat. They all have tipping points: breakups, lost jobs, financial or medical crises, drug or alcohol abuse. , 7 It breaks my heart to watch my neighbors to the south of us. How is it that it is too early to invigorate the discussion about gun safety -- considered to be inappropriate politicization -- but it's not too early to slag the FBI, an organization that just happens to be on the Republican's hit list? Talk about politicizing. As your president might say: sad., 7 Our laws are designed to punish us for the crimes we commit not what we might do.  Even if the FBI had spoken with him they're very limited on what they can do until a crime is committed.  Other countries don't have this problem.  Time to treat gun violence like the national health crisis that it is., 7 We still have to be wary of guns in the hands of the Nikolas Cruzes in this country who don't post a threat or boast of shooting up a school.  Disciplining the FBI does not make the bigger problem go away.\n\nIt still comes down to the easy availability of guns.  Other countries with mentally ill people don't have the mass murder problem we have.  Guns are the enabler., 7 The FBI was also in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination of JFK. I am not a judge or an attorney, and I don't even play one on TV, but I hope our courts will focus on justice rather than on finger-pointing, legal technicalities or psychiatric theories and excuses. Too often serious issues of crime and punishment are decided by which lawyer can come up with the most creative defense to convince jurors to agree with his or her arguments. Psychiatrists, lawyers, judges and juries CAN make mistakes. Our laws are not just for lawyers, they are for ALL of us. Mass shootings are BOTH gun issues AND mental health issues. I've posted our People for Public Safety Coalition suggestions on the Facebook pages of both the NRA and NAMI (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill)., 7 I don't see how this can be an FBI matter.  That is, I don't see how it falls within its jurisdiction.  The FBI should have forwarded the complaint to the local police.  If they did not, it is a major lapse.\nAlso did the local police get 911 calls before the shooting? I'll bet they did., 7 News reports I heard while driving home today ... mentioned 20 different reports were made to the FBI regarding the violent tendencies of Nikolas Cruz. What steps were authorized for the FBI to have taken in this instance, which were not followed? Has anyone seen updates on this point? I'd like to know and will be searching for these details., 7 Chasing speculation and warnings is futile.  Many will be false and many more will lack anything illegal and many may even be defended as \"free speech\".  The FBI can't chase all these whispers.\nThe point is gun availability, not chasing speculation.  Tons of guns for all is a stupid American experiment and is now a nightmare that makes no sense.  Good luck trying to get all those guns back.  How this is all going to end is anyones guess. , 7 I was truly saddened to see public memorial events turned into everyday political rallies by the progressive Democrats grabbing a chance to pick up a few votes. Have these clowns not learned anything about honoring the dead? \n\n     I am imagining if I had lost my daughter or mother - both teachers - or a grandchild in a mass shooting, and I would probably make a public spectacle for these Pharisees forgetting the dead and turning their memory into one more political event.\n     A memorial for a Minnesota Senator was turned into a grisly political rally a couple decades ago, and the GOP won the next election. I predict the same thing will happen again soon., 7 A single phone tip does not make a case. If all these people had concerns about this kid, why didn't they go to local police who could have done something?\n\nThere is no way Wray should be a fall guy for this. If there's ever a fool who should be run out of town, do not look any further than Rick Scott., 7 The problem with the tip line is that it goes into a data base and where it goes from there should be looked at in terms of assigning priorities. If someone is publishing threats they usually fall within the local police jurisdiction. For it to be federal it has to be within a context that places it within federal jurisdiction. One way to address the jurisdictional issue is similar to the way the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act was put on the books. It places it squarely within federal jurisdiction every time and is not subject to interpretation. Breaching schools grounds by anyone for any reason should be a federal crime and Congress can enact legislation tomorrow if they have a will to do so. Once it is firmly within federal jurisdiction it is much easier to isolate these terrorists and take them into custody., 7 Did the person who contacted the FBI also contact Florida law enforcement? If so, what happened there? If they didn't bother to contact local police, why not?\nFlorida allows, even seems to encourage gun ownership to just about anybody. So maybe law enforcement just ignores tips like this. Or, they're buried in so many tips like this that they can't get to them. (yikes)\nI think a look at \"the big picture\" is called for. Yes, let's look at this individual case, but let's see how other tips and threats have been handled as well. That's the only way any law enforcement agency is going to improve on this issue.\nIn the meantime, condolences for the families and loved ones of the deceased., 7 Florida Governor Rick Scott is exponentially more responsible for this massacre than any FBI director, if we're going to go down this road now.  Governor Scott should first look at himself in the mirror before hunting for scapegoats beyond Nikolas Cruz.\n\nAfter all, who has been a bigger champion in Florida for some of the most lax gun safety laws in the country than Governor Scott?  Florida: a state where an 18 year old can purchase an AR 15 with less hassle than buying a bottle of Sudafed. \n\nAnd Governor Scott, where was Florida's background check system (if such a thing even exists) when Nikolas Cruz, with all his apparent well-known warning signs to local school and law enforcement officials (which also predated any FBI tips by years) showed up at a Florida arms business and legally purchased an AR 15 along with ammo, with nothing to alert the dealer?  But Cruz had no trouble doing so, thanks to the long standing efforts of Governor Scott and his fellow NRA parishioners.  \n\nThis is nothing but an opportunistic ploy by Rick Scott to curry favor with and buddy up to Donald Trump, using this massacre of innocents to help Trump to undermine the credibility of the FBI, thus helping to destroy the Mueller investigation.   \"Wouldn't Donald Trump surely look down favorably on me in the future if I really helped him shut down the Mueller Investigation?\"\n\nAny half wit could see through all this hypocrisy.  But as the old saying goes, \"never let a good tragedy go to waste\"., 7 All this discussion is ridiculous. The solution is obvious. Take away easy access to guns that have no purpose but murder. Start with the gun show loophole., 7 Ah, a call from Rick Scott to fire the F.B.I. Director, Christopher Wray to resign. The Republicans could'nt get any lower. They are using this tragedy to fire Mr. Wray, two days after the Intelligence Chiefs warn of definite Russian plans to derail the coming November elections. Smooth Mr. Trump, very subtle Rick Scott., 7 I'd like to think there are those at the Bureau who are going to be \"pursuing other interests\" very soon., 7 The FBI couldn\u2019t do anything anyway - this guy legally bought his weapon of war and was free to commit mass murder whenever he wanted to thanks to the NRA, Congress and President Trump. There was no reason to arrest him - random, barely traceable social media rants about murdering children and anti-social behavior while owning a machine gun are not illegal in our country. Until he actually murdered children he did nothing illegal. Welcome to the 21st century., 7 Masterful deflection by Rubio and his fellow Republicans who are learning that the public has lost its patience with their \"thoughts and prayers\" in the face of repeated massacres. No mention in this article of gun control or the GOP's shameless advocacy of the gun lobby over the rights and safety of citizens. Neither is there any explanation of what the FBI might have done to prevent this attack had they investigated the tips as thoroughly as they should have., 7 If only those who are so eager to blame the NRA, Republicans, and the appalling Donald Trump would ask themselves what impact cultural changes over the past 50 years have done to this nation.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the \u201860s in suburban Boston just about everyone had a firearm of some sort (and pretty much everyone\u2019s father had served in WWII or Korea). These men knew what weapons could do and, as a result, we were taught to respect them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that atrocities like Newtown and Parkland did not happen then.\n\nFifty years of cultural rot in the popular culture, though, including graphic violence endlessly portrayed and glorified in movies and TV, have taken their toll. Music that glorifies violence against women, the killing of police, ad nauseum don\u2019t help the situation. (And why would President Obama commission an artist for his portrait known for paintings of black women holding severed white heads?). No wonder damaged brains act upon their worst impulses. They\u2019ve been conditioned to bloody violence their entire lives.\n\nWant to prevent future atrocites? Change the popular culture. But then Democrats would have to fill their coffers with money from somewhere other than Hollywood., 7 Please, people, let us not again fall prey to the temptation to be distracted by the latest entrant on the grand Distract and Divide Stage being maintained by affluent and conservative/Republican donors/benefactors:  here, Florida Governor Rick Scott.  It is so easy for these actors/actresses to shout out the \"heads must roll\" mantra, rather than to square up to the daunting task of addressing how seventeen (and counting) young souls perished in the gunfire wrought by a \"peer\" wielding an AR-15 weapon.  Governor Scott reportedly is salivating over gaining a Senate seat, and his shouting to the contrary, it is our responsibility as voting citizens to cause our elected leaders to address firearms/gun policy for real and to help local and state officials work effectively with the FBI and other federal resources to wage an effective campaign to protect our most precious assets.  If that objective is insisted on by those who vote for these elected leaders, the important details will be brought to heel in that process -- including how a tip, however credible/substantive or not, was not followed on with prompt action.  The causes of the latter will no doubt prove to be well more than one, and potentially embarrassing to more than just the FBI and its current Director. , 7 How ironic that Rick Scott be deflecting his responsibility for Florida's existing gun laws and casting blame. Didn't he receive an A rating from the NRA?  It's his children who went to school as they do every day, and didn't go home that day. He failed his constituents. At the end of the day, Scott has plenty of skin in the game. , 7 Consider the disarray that has been sown and is now bearing strange fruit at every level of the federal government since January 2017. The FBI director is a too-easy target, and personnel changes are what a bad CEO calls for when businesses are failing for more fundamental reasons., 7 Obviously the FBI should have followed up on that tip. The fact that they didn\u2019t suggests that they need more resources, however, not that the director should resign. How on earth would that help? Of course it might help Mr Trump by disrupting the Russia investigation. The Republican Party made it clear that this is a big priority for them long before his attack.  Of course to use this tragedy for that purpose would be unspeakably cynical. Which is just to say that it would be pretty much standard operating procedure for the likes of Rick Scott or Donald Trump. I would not be surprised if Trump repeats Scott\u2019s call for Wray\u2019s resignation on Twitter in the very near future. That would be the coup de grace. , 7 All of the finger-pointing ignores the question of what the FBI should have done, given this information.  Can someone be arrested on suspicion of intent to do something terrible?  No, and that's a good thing.  The amount of \"why didn't the FBI DO something?\" (and this is very prominent in main stream media), without any realistic assessment of what could have been done is astounding., 7 It is commendable that the FBI owns up to its mistake, but it\u2019s not the only party to blame. Local police knew already a lot more than the FBI about this problem student. Just before the Florida shooting, local police in Everett, WA, followed up on a tip, obtained a search warrant and prevented what would in all likelihood been a similar mass shooting as in Florida. Of course, no 19 year old should have been able to legally buy an assault weapon, in fact no one but military and law enforcement should have assault weapons. And let\u2019s not forget it\u2019s Trump in the first place who rescinded Obama\u2019s prohibition on selling firearms to the mentally ill. Just in case he and his flunkies use this tragedy to attack the FBI again, which he\u2019ll certainly do., 7 How convenient to blame the FBI now as our president has been trying to discredit them. Perhaps this is an alternative fact or the Russians are interfering again., 7 Rick Scott is ridiculous. Why hasn't he done one thing to prevent the rampant gun violence in Florida? Another politician avoiding accountability by blaming an organization that unlike Donald J Trump and his minions in congress and in governorships, admitted their failure, even though it's unclear what they could have legally done thanks to what is legal in this country. , 7 It's time we honor people who say something when they see something.  These people are heroes, trying to prevent tragedy.  If we honored them, perhaps more people would know how important it is for all of us to work together to keep our communities safe., 7 Republican Politicians (and some Democrats to a lesser degree) are terrified of the NRA.  They are more worried about their reelection than protecting Americans from mass shootings.  They fear they will be \"primaried\" by the NRA and the President, so they go against the wishes of the American people when it come to any gun control or even bump stocks.  The influence of the NRA has grown immensely in the past 15 years.  They were aided greatly by 5 activist, Republican Supreme Court Justices when they rewrote the 2nd Amendment in 2008.  The vast majority of Americans who support stricter gun control laws need to vote the NRA owned politicians out of office.  \n\nAustralia turned their gun violence problem around through effective gun control measures.  They weren't hampered by a rewritten 2nd Amendment, but even the Heller case provides for restrictions of gun ownership and making certain types of weapons illegal.  The number of gun owners in Australia is down 75%, although the remaining gun owners are buying more guns now.  The same situation is found the the US, where a lower percentage of people buy more and more guns.  The fact is that gun deaths in Australia have been reduced significantly, and our gun death rate is now 4.5 times as high.\n\nWe are awash in guns, including many semi-automatic weapons; but there are significant measures that can be taken to reduce gun violence, even with the politically rewritten 2nd Amendment, and resulting propaganda from the NRA., 7 Reviewing criticism of the FBI by pols in Florida: Rubio has received over 3 MILLION from NRA during his political careeer; Scott has an A+ NRA rating; Bondi (AG) urged the passage of removing restrictions on gun purchasers 18-20 years old.  , 7 1.  Guns are the main problem.  And it\u2019s not the FBI\u2019s fault so many people can get hold of them all too easily.\n\n2.  I lay more blame on Trump\u2019s running down and undermining of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies.  This has led to people leaving, a lack of top officials in place.  \n\n3.  Even if we get rid of all guns, we must recognize that it is impossible for any society today to be totally safe.  As such, we must rely on one another, on voting, on an insistence that citizens have less ability (guns!) to damage other citizens.\n\n4.  We must not overly blame the FBI, or local enforcement, for those times when someone bad slips through their fingers.  I\u2019m sure they are doing their best.  I imagine that will redouble their efforts.  But blaming will not bring back these lives.  And the FBI did not do the shooting, intend the shooting, or deliberately allow it to happen.\n\n5. If the White House now redoubles its blaming of the FBI, that will not solve the problem.  Give them more money!  Train more agents!  Stop undermining their work by publicly rounding on them!\n\nWe must remain calm here.  The number of times they do thrwart potential violence is not known to us.  So the few times they lose an opportunity to investigate needs to be kept in that larger perspective.\n\nI grieve for the lost lives.  We must use them to make things better.  Not to make things worse!, 7 The FBI did not make Florida one of the deadliest gun states - Governor Scott and his cohort did.\n\nSince local politicians make those gun laws, then local and state police need to police those gun buyers (helped by insurance companies when the law is finally changed to require gun buyers to purchase liability insurance.)\n\nLocal police and state police in the deadliest gun states should track the social media, email, text, police activity and phone use of everyone who purchases an AR15. When they find that that's too expensive and too intrusive a process - no problem, then they can outlaw the guns like they should've been from the beginning., 7 Once again a Republican deflection from their refusal to enact sensible gun legislation and from the state where it is easier to buy a military style weapon than it is to buy a gun and one of the states with the lax  gun laws. \n\nMr. Wray, please do not step down and play into the hands of an administration and political party that is attempting to slowly dismantle our government., 7 Please don't focus on this story so much that you give an out to President Trump and the GOP Congress.  What they have done to prevent reasonable gun legislation  in the USA has been systematic, not an oversight.  They deserve to be answerable to the public for each death., 7 Rick Scott, not the current head of the F.B.I., is the one who should resign. After all, it's his state. He's the governor. If he can't keep his constituents safe, he should bet out of the way and let someone who can do it. , 7 I wonder how many \"tips\" like this concerning school shooters that the FBI receives in a day. 50? 100? 1,000? \n\nI wonder how many \"tips\" concerning suspected foreign terrorists that the FBI receives in a day. 50? 100? 1,000? \n\nI suspect that the FBI follows up all \"tips\" related to terrorism and has limited resources for investigating other suspicious activity. \n\nWhat would be the needed budget for the FBI if they had to follow-up every \"tip\"?\n\nIs Congress willing to fund the FBI by imposing a sales tax on guns and ammunition?\n\nHow about improving access to mental health care? How about funding that through  a sales tax on guns and ammunition?, 7 Trump doesn't like Wray because he tells the truth about the Porter timeline, exposing Trump's lies. So now Rick Scott says he wants him fired -- on very thinly disguised orders of the White House -- because the FBI director is somehow responsible for the FBI's failure to nab a mentally unstable youth with an AR-15 that he legally purchased thanks to the NRA's lobbying of Congress to pass a bill that makes it easier for mentally unstable people to buy guns. Personally, one Wray is worth 100 Republican toadies, and the sooner we get rid of them the better. As for Scott, it's up to you Floridians to make sure he is kicked out of the statehouse pronto., 7 Wow, all this outrage from the guys who brought you the NRA. This is the most blatant example of talking out of both side of your mouth I believe I've ever seen. Of course this plays to their need to diss the FBI who are hot on the trail of laundered Russian money that could lead right up to each and every one of them. How utterly transparent. Also, the FBI probably gets hundreds if not thousands of these \"tips\" a day. Yeah, we live in a dystopian gun fantasy game where we are all potential victims because there are estimated to be 1.5 million assault rifles here. I get up every day and ask myself what am I doing here, I might as well live at the business end of a firing range. The FBI is not the problem.  , 7 This is just another example of why you should not completely outsource your security to the government. Do you think they are usually competent and caring enough to protect you? Hint: the answer is no., 7 How convenient for do-nothing Republicans to blame the FBI for not preventing this school shooting -- when they themselves have failed repeatedly to disarm people of their AK-47 assault rifles.\nThis paper and others talk about Republicans doing nothing on gun control, but they are doing something: they are very actively fighting it, deflecting it, and drowning out the chorus of American voices demanding action now. 2018 cannot get here soon enough!, 7 Let's not forget who appointed the new head of the FBI. Perhaps had Comey been there,17 people would be alive today! That's all I have to say. , 7 In the minds of some twisted citizens, President Trump's comments about the biases of the FBI have now persuaded some of them to tweet that the FBI was so busy investigating the President that they failed to respond to the tips that were received. Trump has undermined and diminished one of the leading investigative and crime fighting agencies in the nation. This FBI mistake needs attention; the person(s) who failed in the protocols need to be punished. For the enduring security of the nation, however, the last thing we need now is another tweet from Trump castigating the FBI!, 7 Is anyone surprised that Trump supporters, like Governor Rick Scott, would rather blame the FBI than talk about getting weapons of war off our streets? Sure! Get rid of Christopher Wray...but nothing will change while the NRA owns our legislators.\nExpect another \u201cmass casualty\u201d event next week. It\u2019s the \u201cprice we pay for freedom\u201d, ya know?, 7 If we can't keep guns away from someone this disturbed who was reported as clearly a threat to others there isn't much hope for reducing mass murders.\n\nOn the other hand, using the same methodology as the NYT does in assessing the threat of Muslim terrorism or crime among illegal immigrants, I would note that schools are among the safest places for children to be.  A child is much more likely to be killed by his/her own parent(s) than by a school shooter., 7 This could have been a mistake on the part of the FBI not following up enough on this tip.  However, is the FBI supposed to look into a crystal ball and predict every future shooting by every mental case out there?  It is no reason whatsoever for the FBI Director to resign, according to GOP Gov. Rick Scott and the rest of the GOP, who just want to politicize this and do anything possible to discredit the FBI for their part in the Russia Investigation.  The majority of fault for incidents like these fall squarely on the GOP, their constituents, the NRA and the gun manufacturers, PERIOD, EXCLAMATION POINT\n\nP, 7 In many states, you can buy an assault style military rifle when you turn 18. It is illegal to buy or consume alcohol until you are 21.\nWhy is it easier to buy a gun than buy alcohol, for a teenager with mental health issues?, 7 It seems popular right now to find an issue and just get upset. That's not how it should work. The first tip, about a \"professional school shooter\" is simply not grounds for anything.\n\nCombined with the second, about which we know nothing in particular, might have called for investigation. But then what? Mr. Cruz had committed no crime. He owned and possessed a gun legally. He was gainfully employed. Somebody said he was a danger. He is interviewed. He denies he is a danger. There is nothing else, even with the broadest reading of this article. How would the interview stop the shooting?\n\nAssume the FBI disbelieved his denials. What then? You cannot detain or arrest somebody  because you disbelieve him. He would leave, free to shoot. \n\nIt's fine to be upset, but think,, people. We all wish we could change the past. Sometimes we wish it desperately and together. I remember that feeling after 9 11, on that day and after. We are nevertheless gifted with rational abilities. Knowing all we know, how can we prevent this happening again? Clearly wishing the FBI did even more still would not prevent this horror.\n\nSo, thinking hard now, what do we do? Address the problem of guns, and what they do. Let's not be distracted. The beautiful children and others weere not shot by the FBI's incompetence, if that's true, nor by mental illness alone. They are dead because a gun was avaiilable to shoot them. One might think all these distractions are being funded by the NRA., 7 A wonderful opportunity to use this massacre to cover for Trump. You gotta love the GOP\u2014they block any sane gun control, cant stand any kind of expansion of healthcare, which includes mental healthcare, and their first priority is to cover for a guy who has abused and humiliated them at every turn, even after they got their rich-enriching tax cut out of him. This is the party of morality amd family values\u2014more accurately, they are exactly what Chomsky calls them, with theirnonstop militarism, nuke-love\u2014both shared by many Democrats\u2014and complete denial of ongoing, worsening climate catastrophe: the most dangerous organization in human history, a statement he agrees is outrageous but asks people to consider whether its true. It is. Dont like Chomsky? Try Norman Orenstein: the GOP is an insurgency, not an actual parliamentary political party. , 7 Nice deflection.  Blame the FBI.  And convenient, also., 7 The warning should have been checked and the persons gun possession should have been questioned. Would it have been too much to ask what the deadly weapons are for? Legal age for possession or use of firearms outside gun ranges should be 21. Too many kidos and teenagers going around killing innocent school children ranging from elementary school to high school. From Sandy hook to Parkland, Florida school. The nation needs to stand up to the nonsense of the national rifle association and there has to be dipartisan uproar to stop gun violence. Killing of school children is as usual under Trump watch just as it was during the Obama watch. With the exception that terrorist activity during Trump watch has clearly diminished both in the USA and overseas. We need a rapidly moving special counsel to investigate the reasons for the epidemic of school violence and make practical and effective recommendation. With Mueller indictment of Russian nationals attempting to influence the 2016 presidential elections, it is time for him to wrap up the investigations which most Americans don't care about. Majority of Americans care very much about the safety of students in schools and colleges and would like to see an end to the gun violence and killing of innocent Americans., 7 This is an EXTREMELY poorly reported story and not worthy of the NY Times.\n\nThis is what we don't know.  What entails a \"tip\"?  Where was the call made?  Were local law enforcement and Rick Scott's own police force also notified or was it only the FBI?  \n\nThis seems like the NRA trying to blame someone other than the politicians they own who made it possible for any mentally ill person to purchase an assault weapon capable of mowing down dozens of children or teens in a minute.\n\nAnd the NY Times is once again demonstrating their lack of reportorial skills here when it comes to trying their best to please the right wing and repeat their talking points.\n\nWhere did this \"tip\" come?  And how was it made?  And did the same right wing FBI agents who run most bureaus -- like the ones who left a message on a IT subcontractor's help desk voicemail -- investigate this and find ties to the right wing white power movement and then drop it?, 7 Blaming the FBI for Cruz's mass killing is like blaming Hillary for the Benghazi terrorists' ambush.\n\nWe don't live in a perfect world or a vacuum.\n\nAll we can hope is to learn from it and do better down the road., 7 This is so deeply painful to learn (we had hints yesterday). To have confirmed -- and admitted -- is sad, infuriating, you name it it, beyond measure.\n\nNot the first time FBI has dropped the ball with devastating consequences. Think about 19th hijacker, Moussaoui (sp?) and the buried memo / email, shoved into someone's drawer, describing his and others' flight training, etc. Not shared or moved above appropriately. Had brave FBI whistle-blower Colleen Rowley and others not insisted this information come out, as at that time, FBI was steadfastly denying anything of the sort had (or in this case, hadn't) occurred ... we might have never known.\n\nSo, I guess it is some measure of progress that at least they are forthrightly admitting they totally missed a 'blinking red' flag to stop Parkland school murders.\nNot that any of that will help the 17 killed, their families, or the students, faculty, local law enforcement or community forever changed and traumatized by this, most likely, wholly preventable event. \n\nObviously, procedural elements and failsafes still need to improve at FBI in terms of following up on leads, and working with local law enforcement. I hope they dig in vigorously to make those needed changes.\nBecause nearly 17 years later after 9/11/2001, we shouldn't still be having these unacceptable lapses.\n\nMy heart is in anguish for these families.\n~ 9/11 family member, 7 Massacre of school kids will never happen to politicians.  Not to Barron Trump or Obama\u2019s daughter who go to school with a Secret Service detail.  But it won\u2019t happen to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s or Chuck Schumer\u2019s great grandchildren.  Those children go to elite schools which don\u2019t have students like Nikolas Cruz.  But it won\u2019t happen to Marco Rubio\u2019s or Ted Cruz\u2019s children.  \n\nBut citizens don\u2019t focus on resolving the central problem after a huge tragedy like Parkland.  If a plan is articulated by one citizen, another citizen will pipe up with \u201dMore kids die from drugs than by school shooters.\u201d  Then another pipes up with \u201dThe Democrats could fix this.\u201d  Another says \u201dThis should be fixed with Federal money.\u201d  Another says \u201dNo way...local school districts need to lead the change, not Washington.\u201d\n\nAd nauseum.  Right?  Does this sound familiar?\n\nAmericans can\u2019t focus on the current crisis long enough to turn things around.  National ADHD.\n\nAnd all politicians are more focused on re-election than on resolving things.....since a tragedy like this will never happen to their family!!, 7 The FBI knows there was Russian meddling in the election and the President fired the director for investigating that, and now they want to fire the new director for allowing the NRA sponsored sale of assault weapons to mentally unstable persons as a constitutional right.  , 7 The Governor of Florida's reasoning means government is the cause of this action, and it's actions are not adequate in preventing this type of violence. His premise means he goes too.\nYou can't point the finger at one guy and say he caused this. It's incomplete. It's a fallacious argument. It's scapegoating.\nThat is not a speech act of leadership. A leader is accountable. Who funded this education system. Who is training the educators? Where is the community in it's involvement in education? What role does a community and it's government play in the face of the outcomes we are experiencing in some of our young boys?\nWhat is it in our culture, our government that generates habits of isolation. Isolation is hard on everyone, some externalize the stress. Some are left alone too much and their stress compiles them to start thinking, alone about what is wrong, which isn't calming, it's triggering.\nWhere is the prosocial opportunities that unite us? The ones that leave no child left behind.\nThese conditions are not created through tests.\nIt's a sense of belonging we are after.\nIt's a fundamental human need, the 1st ingredient in Marian Wright Edelman's recipe for healthy human development:\nA safe base thru caring relationships.\nSkill building: emotional, physical, mental, social.\nRelatable, attainable expectations.\nMeaningful participation.\nCommunity involvement.\n\nThat governor is feeling shame; scapegoating is a strategy of that drift.\n\nResilience building for all's what's needed, 7 Cynical and craven politicians are using this news about the FBI as as diversionary tactic.  The problem is NOT the FBI but the NRA and our easy access to killing machines like the AR-15I!  Asking Christopher Wray to step down is just Mr. Scott's way of ingratiating himself with Trump.   , 7 Blame and finger pointing. Anything to avoid the actual issue.\n\nScott is the local authority. His support for guns to be readily available to anyone who has cash is what out them in the hands of his mass murderer. His babbling is an insult to every kid who was killed or wounded in his state, their families and every voter.  , 7 A great deal of blame needs to be put on Trump and his allies for the constant (fraudulent) attack on the FBI over the Russian Investigation.  The FBI is made up of people.  People under attack from their (ultimate) boss lose focus. Make mistakes.  \n\nThis is one one them.  , 7 Calling for the local FBI officials to resign or be fired is appropriate. Calling for the director to resign is political and disgusting., 7 Nobody has done more to undermine the effectiveness of the FBI than Donald Trump.  Firing Director Comey because he would not pledge loyalty, claiming the FBI was corrupt and out to get him, etc., etc., etc.  And if the GOP wants Director Wray fired, what about the man who hand picked Wray to direct the FBI?  The Trump Administration is incompetent and Trump's bloody fingerprints are all over this one., 7 Scott blaming the FBI for the redneck gun culture that Republicans like Scott have been creating in Florida for years.\n\nYou are Governor. What did YOU do so as you didn't need to be saved from yourself by the Feds? , 7 Blame the FBI??? How many thousands of warnings does the FBI get each day? The blame belongs entirely to the NRA, and their lackeys in the Congress and state legislatures who have permitted automatic weapons of mass murder to be easily purchased by anyone with the money to pay for them. Until Congress outlaws all automatic weapons for use by anyone but the military we will continue to see mass murders of innocent children, and adults. The Congress is responsible for each and every death caused by these guns. The mentally ill don't cause these deaths, it's their guns that kill people., 7 Teenagers in America get on social media, email your Congressman, email the NRA and tell them no more. Make your voices heard. Tell them you are afraid, tell them you don\u2019t want to die in a classroom, tell them you don\u2019t want your brother or sister to die in school. Please get your voices out there thru any means possible.  Twitter, Facebook no more.... , 7 The GOP and Trump can't blame the F.B.I. for mentally ill people having guns.\nThey voted for it:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/congress-says-let-the-mentall..., 7 Didn't Trump talk about shooting someone on Fifth Ave? Should the F.B.I. have investigated that?, 7 Should we feel bad for US citizens whom collectively and individually, are handed Democracy on a silver platter and are too dumb to make it work? At some point, you just have to say the gullible voters are getting just what they deserve.\nThey don't even vaguely understand the issue of campaign finance reform, and it is not even a priority message of the NYT editorial staff. So, you enable the gun lobby and a host of other unhealthy situations. Indirectly, the voters and the NYT have caused these shootings., 7 If the FBI director should quit, then Florida Gov. Rick Scott should also quit for failing to act on gun control measures., 7 Rick Scott is up there with Paul Ryan in the hypocrisy department. Aiming for Trump brownie points?, 7 Rick Scott says FBI director should resign.  But in his state an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun and has a lower age requirement.  Perhaps you should resign Mr. Scott.  No you want to run for senate and like Mr. Rubio will gladly take all the money the NRA will give you.  What a sham and a disgrace!  You have blood on your hands and the only justification you could offer for anyone to have a right to own these weapons is that they have them for a hobby and target shooting.  So let them only have access to them at target ranges only or quite simply find another hobby!.  Are we to believe they can be useful for hunting animals or the best means of self defense in protecting your home or family.  What a joke. I am also tired of people saying banning these weapons is complicated because of definition of what constitutes an assault rifle due to modifications. It is like saying people can modify aspects of the car's exhaust system to get around emission standards so let's just give up an forget about such standards and enforcement.  No one should legally have these weapons except law enforcement agents who need to protect themselves and civilians from criminals and the mentally ill who now have access to them and yes Mr. Scott that includes the FBI., 7 Scott has one big set to call for the FBI firing when his own back yard cops couldn't figure up from down! The kid lived in Trumps backyard and was known to profess love of violence. He was expelled for Christmas sake. That's it Scott, sign the bill going thru the Florida House calling for guns in churches and school. What a hypocrite. He takes second place to Rubio who accepted 3 million in NRA money., 7 Sadly, multiple things are the problem. The FBI, lack of gun laws and the fact that he's a white male all contributed to this attack. Plenty of blacks are arrested based on \"suspicious\" behavior when they did nothing but just exist. This shooter showed signs of suspicious behavior for years and nothing was done (he TRAINED with a white supremacist militia group -- hello!). Blacks are labeled as thugs if they have a gun, but if a white person has a gun and wants to attack, he's \"mentally ill\". So folks can't make the argument that you can't arrest someone based on looking suspicious when they do it all the time to minorities. , 7 And this will be the way the NRA wins again. And more of our children will die. Shame., 7 FBI was too busy with Trump and Russia, so forgot about other insignificant matters., 7 NYT: Why the consistent focus on what the FBI does wrong, rather than the numerous instances when it does things right in the protection of our country? Thank you., 7 In 2004 the Bush (R) Congress refused to extend the automatic weapons ban enacted during Clinton's (D) presidency in 1994.  CBS news reported:  The expiration of the ban is a victory for the National Rifle Association, which had made lobbying against the legislation one of its top priorities.\n\nIn 2016 Trump bragged on live TV:\n\n\"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,\" Trump told attendees at an Iowa rally Jan. 23, \"and I wouldn't lose any voters.\"\n\nabsolutely no ambiguity about who, when & where this was said.  Prime example of limits of FBI to act before crime committed.  Was this person fully investigated and endlessly staked out?\n\nNo doubt it is terrible to learn that this shooting might have been prevented by the FBI but one fundamental tenet of our country is a person is innocent until proven guilty (as Trump reminds us often these days when supporting his cadre of degenerates in light of clear evidence of their crimes).\n\nThere is absolutely no reason for automatic weapons originally developed during the Viet Nam war to be legally sold & remain in anyone's possession.  It's time to stop raping the 2nd amendment.  It's time to vote all NRa ranked & supported Congress members out of office & send them packing (no pun intended)., 7 Response from FBI heard on network news last night; do you have any idea how many such leads we get?\nABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING., 7 Just an amazing number of FBI apologists! Let's face it. The FBI is incompetent. , 7 I don't care about the politics.  Larry Nasser molested dozens of girls while the FBI was conducting an inquiry. It took a brave victim and an Indianapolis newspaper to finally stop him. Now this. Admittedly this is a small sample of only two cases, but it sure doesnt look good., 7 Stand your ground Scott. The supreme hypocrite. Wray was just designated director and could have had no clue about this kid\n\n The FBI gets rafts of notices from all kinds of nuts , kinks , and people with an agenda.\n\nTruth of the matter: Senator Grassley introduced a bill allowing mental incompetents to purchase guns...no lie,,,and is now wondering where the mentally incompetent get guns.\n\nThe Republicans , bought off by the NRA , will do nothing about this. They don't give a damn as long as their wallets are stuffed with NRA money.\n\nThis nonsense of selling assault weapons to the public at large is beyond insane. But , a neo-con Supreme Court majority sold a ridiculous interpretation of the 2nd Amendment which has been irrelevant since the Civil War. \n\nPrayers will not be answered as no reasonable deity would allow the slaughter of innocents on the scale that it occurs in an America which has become the OK Corral of the world on a daily basis.\n\nStop the flat out idiocy and get these weapons off the street., 7 This is purely just another attack by political opponents seeking to discredit the F.B.I. for their involvement into the investigations of Mr. Mueller. This mass shooting should not be used for political gains. The attention should be on the lives lost, the families and all affected by yet another school shooting in America., 7 This is nothing new. None other than those terrible Ruszians warned us that at least one of the Boston bombers was dangerous. Nothing was done.  End result, death. In Colorado the psychiatrist warned authorities about about the shooter. Nothing was done. End result. death. At VPI the killer was supose to be evaluated by psychologist. He didn't , bought a gun, and started killing. Now we have the FBI not doing what they should have and the end result is more death.  If the FBI, the Clorado authorities, the Virgina court syste had acted on informatin they had, lives would have been saved. This in an area where we should be able  to get a consensus we eould only try., 7 It would be interesting to know how many \"tips\" the FBI gets on a daily basis.  Given the current climate, they must be inundated.  Can we really expect to follow up on all of them?  The demand the Wray resign is Republicans like Scott blame shifting.  He has presided over Florida during several of these mass shootings and done nothing.  Finger should be pointed at him.\nWe know that Cruz's mother called the police to come \"talk\" to her sons.  Cruz had committed no crime, he had no record, and he bought the weapon legally.   The only solution in cases like this is deny the individual the opportunity to commit mass murder -- guns should not be readily available.  , 7 The question, of course, is; what could they have done? Unless we\u2019re talking about a preemptive detention the legal grounds for intervening would have been a slippery slope. The concept of freedom of speech is at a crisis point in America. One man\u2019s free speech is another man\u2019s reason for incarceration. It is difficult to discern who or what the FBI actually stands for. Is it an independent and objective law enforcement agency, or an instrument of government oppression, as during the Hoover years? Trump clearly prefers the latter. The NRA does not want citizen gun owners to be randomly harassed by the Federal government. And although there may be motive available the NRA wants to be sure there are always means available for such killings. The politicizing of this agency in this debate does not allow objectivity. Sessions clearly wants to use the FBI and DOJ to implement his own moral agenda (kind of like Hoover). With so much societal and political pressure pulling the agency in so many directions it seems unlikely that the FBI will be capable of much effectiveness at all. This is probably how Cruz fell through the cracks. However, as Trump and Sessions want marijuana prosecuted, and immigrants harassed, they have no appetite for going after armed, violent nationalists. The Florida massacre was another tragedy under their narrow sighted leadership. This cannot end well. , 7 It is easy to go after FBI but very difficult to go against NRA. We need gun control laws. FBI should look into NRA donation of 3 million dollar To Marco Rubio., 7 I'm really surprised that the agency that tried to get Martin Luther King Jr. to kill himself spent more time investigating a Presidential political campaign than protecting the lives of 17 teenagers.\n\nIf you criticize the FBI, you're probably working for Putin., 7 Go USA! We value our guns more than our children. , 7 Looks like Trump has another stooge- Rick Scott.\n\nHow dare this guy, who has an  A+ rating from The NRA, attack the Director of the F.B I.?, 7 Ok, you \"see something\" and \"say something.\"  What, exactly, is going to happen?  I want to know what effects my words will have.  If it's to \"investigate\" and the do nothing because no laws were broken, then what's the point?  I don't see a shooting case yet where preknowledge would have done a thing.  \n\nI'm no fan of the FBI.  They were Hoover's toadies for a long time, and much too lacking in creativity and too enmeshed in NSA and CIA competitiveness to really serve the citizens.\n\nBut why pile on them here? They are trying to be transparent about their potential failures (potential because who knows what they could have actually done if the info made it to Miami).  Blaming them will only undermine their credibility and give the Mango Mussolini more reasons to impugn the Russia investigation.  \n\nLet's blame the real culprits - those Americans who love guns so much they can't stomach the thought that they may not be able to buy that AR15 they've been wanting, the marketing arm of the gun lobby - the NRA, and every freaking politician who has accepted money from the NRA, including the president., 7 Don't blame the police. Blame the citizens who support a country with 4% of the world's population and 44% of the guns. Everyone outside the US can see it for the idiocy it is., 7 A note on something people have missed big-time.\n\nA member of a neo-Nazi organization, based purely on names released and those of city and school officials indicates a high probability a heavy number of Germanic-Eastern European Jews were victims and/or school authorities were Jewish.\n\nWhen checking hate groups and their members, reporters frequently call the Southern Poverty Law Center first.\n\nEither the first call or the one yealding answers, described as \u201cthe Anti Defamation League\u201d that\u2019s the Anti Defamation League of b\u2019nai b\u2019rith, I am sure.\n\nBut like a Trump Holocaust Remembrance Day speech, the Times seems to forget Jews were involved in an organization the foremost authority on groups devoted to killing a lot of people STARTING with Jews.\n\nIf he had targeted blacks or Muslims,It would be in headline and lede., 7 Scott has it exactly back-asswards: it is HE who should resign.\n\nHopefully, Florida voters will keep Scott's unwavering fealty to the NRA in mind when they vote in November \u2014 and Rubio's in 2020 (https://whyy.org/articles/marco-rubio-profile-classic-gun-lackey/)., 7 a congresswoman/man's child will hv to be killed before anything happens..., 7 If the FBI had questioned him he would have answered \"yes I have guns, no I don't want to shoot anybody\" and that would be the end of it.\n#Fuck the NRA, 7 \"Agents from the F.B.I. Jackson, Miss., field office looked into the comment but could not identify who had posted it from database and open-source searches, the F.B.I. said. The F.B.I. was also reviewing what happened after the agents received the information.\"\n\nReally? He used the name Nikolas Cruz on his Youtube post. How hard could it have to find out who posted the comment?, 7 Was the Miami FBI office overloaded with security issues surrounding Trump's weekly visits to his Mar-a-lago resort?  Just askin.  , 7 If the tipster would have said he was Muslim, I guarantee they would have followed up immediately. This severely disturbed young man was telling everyone he was a domestic terrorist in training, but no one (who could have actually stopped him) took the time to listen. The FBI definitely has to share some blame for allowing this psychopath to commit mass murder against his former classmates and teachers. And we obviously need strict gun control laws in this country which means we have to take on and take down the NRA., 7 Director Wray may resign as soon as Governor Scott leads the charge to ban assault weapons of all types in the state of Florida and Florida republicans return ALL their NRA bribes and sponsor laws to have mandatory background checks for all rifles and hand guns. , 7 Oh, man, just the PR the FBI needs at this moment.  I cringe as I await the RWNJ spin., 7 Give the fbi a break, it takes a lot of personnel to try to frame the duly elected President!!!, 7 So what would the FBI do? Arrest him for uttering threats? Have him analyzed by a psych doctor? With our laws ?\nLet\u2019s get serious..., 7 Is Gov. Rick Scott going to resign since he accepts money from the NRA and advocates for lax gun control?, 7 The guy used his full name in the YouTube comment. How hard is it to find a person with that name, show up at his door and question him?, 7 Without the easy availability of the AR-15, aided and abetted by the NRA, the children would be alive today. , 7 Hmmm....kinda like when an FBI agent warned the Bush administration in 2001 that suspicious persons from the Middle East were taking flying lessons and there was a possibility of a terrorist plot involving crashing jet planes?, 7 FBI is best at stopping plots they have a hand in starting, 7 Cue the predictable chorus of Republican politicians and NRA members blaming the FBI.  They are lying.\n\nThe reason the FBI can't investigate those who hoard guns and raise criminal suspicions is precisely because of the clamor from Republicans and the NRA any time they try to do so.  It happens again and again.\n\nRemember the Branch Davidians in Waco Texas?  Remember that there was a cult tat was hoarding weapons, refusing to pay taxes, with crimes being committed all the way up to child rape by the Cult Leader, David Koresh?  \n\nWhen the FBI tried to investigate, a bunch of White Supremacists lining the roads warned the cult that the FBI had come to town and the Republican chorus of politicians argued they should not violate the freedom of these \"gun owners.\"\n\nSo let Rick Scott and Marco Rubio and their ilk call loudly for the FBI to do its job and search those who behave suspiciously who hoard weapons.  That would be a win/win for all, right?, 7 Please explain exactly how the FBI could have 'acted' on the tip.\n\nAnd why Christopher Wray should lose his job over what happened in the field.\n\nRick Scott is a panicky ninny.\n\nAnything to help the NRA., 7 Exactly one year ago - Donald Trump eagerly signed a new law (reversing Obama, of course) allowing mentally ill people do buy guns.  There was no photo op, no stupid grin surrounded by his fellow-NRA money grubbing you know whats.  So let the blame rightly fall where it should - the man in power who couldn't wait to put guns back in the hands of the Nikolas Cruzes of the world.  It is Trump and his Rubio and all the rest of them who gleefully cuts social services for the mentally ill and their families who struggle to manage these conditions.  Thoughts, prayers - delivered by tweet no less - are just a disgusting insult to all those who have suffered loss at the hands of willfully ineffective leaders.  , 7 FBI is not broken even Trump is really trying hard, but we should not forger the people working in FBI they are humans too, when they are under attact from the person in White House it is effecting their work, this kid has no criminal record, they should go after who sold the gun to him, we need a new gun control law now, 7 Every high school has at least one Nik Cruz.  We'll have to spend billions investigating every one of them. \n\nOr we could just ban assault rifles., 7 Who knew that the F.B.I. could be so forever, blind and ignorant?\n\nJames Comey's unethical unprofessional influential mishandle of the Clinton server matter exposed gross incompetence at the top of the F.B.I..\n\nWill Director Wray hold himself or other's accountable for this deadly failure?, 7 The FBI could not locate someone using their real name? That makes no sense!, 7 Perhaps the F.B.I. believed the subject to be Ted Cruz?, 7 Years spent profiling serial and mass murderers seem wasted when the FBI ignores warnings like this. Such a shame., 7 Gosh, Mr. Comey.  You missed big-time.  Were you too busy CYAing with your agents re the Presidential Election to pick this low-hanging fruit?\nThe polls before this one show America's % of confidence steadily declining since Comey declared himself our national savior .  It was 49, then 40. after this, I put it at about 2.  , 7 In Florida, where people like the NRA\u2019s Marion Hammer wield absolute control over elected state officials like Ben Albritton*, is it any wonder that even the FBI would think twice before \u201cpersecuting\u201d a guy who owns an assault rifle?\nThe ONLY way to stop NRA insanity is to vote every single Republican out of office in November.\n* https://www.thetrace.org/2016/04/how-legendary-nra-lobbyist-marion-hamme..., 7 The FBI should have found out of which Well Regulated Militia Cruz was a member, and got in touch with that Well Regulated Militia to have them stop him., 7 Governor Scott has little credibility in this issue as he presides over a state with some of the most loose gun laws in the country. \n\nWHY WAS A 19 YEAR OLD WHO CANT LEGALLY BUY A BEER OR A HANDGUN ABLE TO BUY AN ASSAULT RIFLE WHOSE ONLY REASONABLE USE IS TO KILL, MAIM OR TERRORIZE OTHER HUMANS?\n\nGET REAL SCOTT, FLORIDA, AND REPUBLICANS!!, 7 Cruz obviously didn't want to die in this cowardly attack. A simple visit and interview from the FBI might well have kept him from thinking he could get away with it., 7 For perspective, how many tips of this gravity does the FBI get in the course of a year?, 7 Rick Scott of the largest Medicare fraud in Florida history telling the FBI director he has to step down? Rick Scott of expanding the stand your ground laws in Florida, the same law that helped acquit George Zimmerman of murdering Trayvon Martin? That Rick Scott? Gimme a break., 7 How dare a shameless NRA advocate like Rick Scott attack Chris Wray? Local law enforcement had multiple warnings about this shooter, why didn't they stop him? Google \"rick scott pam bondi nra age limit\" some time, to see where the FL state government really stands on protecting children from gun violence. , 7 This will be used by the NRA-owned GOP to shift the argument away from gun control.  Our only hope: Vote for gun control candidates in November and remove the NRA's hold on congress!!, 7 Wray took over the FBI in August of 2017. Less than 6 months, so don't be blaming him. You've been running Florida for what? 7 years? How many mass murders have been committed on your watch? What exactly have you done to prevent it? You Governor need to resign, today!, 7 How about Rick resign first for defunding healthcare in this state., 7 Here we are 48 hours removed from the mass murder of high school kids and the Russia indictment has replaced any coverage of the crime on major cable news outlets. Oh, and our \"elected representatives\" have packed their thoughts and prayers, along with their NRA contributions and gone home for what is, no doubt, considered a well earned vacation. Meanwhile here we sit, waiting for the massacre. Pathetic!, 7 Senator Cruz , one of top 10 contribution from NRA  receivers doesn't want fingers pointed at him. Shame. While his biggly boss, the one who called him nasty names during Russian election, degrades FBI, No wonder the messages are getting confused. And when is right time NRA receiver? Never? After each shooting you will get on your knees and pray, but you won't do the one thing you guys were elected to do. Make laws for us. Keep us safe. You vote to protect other countries, protect us. , 7 Great job, Top Law Enforcement Agency of the Land.\n(Can you spell N-E-G-L-I-G-E-N-T?), 7 aha! we found the scapegoat!  the FBI.  all fixed now.  the heat is off the NRA and the do nothing party.  , 7 The FBI didn\u2019t ask Youtube to identify who made the comment?  How is that possible? Doesn\u2019t sound like a credible excuse., 7 The shooter took an Uber to school carrying a rifle. Saw something. Said nothing., 7 Just another deflection away from the essence that the politicians do not want to discuss or act upon: gun control. Granted, this person slipped through the cracks, but, like generals who are fighting the last war, politicians become reactive instead of proactive. \"Fix the problem that has just occurred, and we will be safe.\" And then there is mental health. The perpetrator has mental health problems, but our decision-makers also have mental health issues because they do onto want to think about or propose gun control. Being OCD is a mental health problem, and o;ur leaders are OCD for the NRA!, 7 Perhaps Governorn Scott should step down since it is Florida\u2019s state law that allowed a 19 year old to buy an automatic rifle , 7 The NRA must be breathing a sigh of relief to hear that the FBI messed up. For a moment, it looked like the blame would placed on the legality of a teenager's ability to purchase an assault rifle., 7 Listen Up Governor Scott.  Your pathetic attempt to toady up to Trump, using this terrible event as a convenient backdrop to \"call out\" the head of the FBI is beyond contempt.  If the FBI missed something that really is reasonable signal to noise, then they deserve a big dressing down.  You present nothing that makes that case.\n\nMeanwhile, the state THAT YOU RUN does an absolutely  awful job of keeping AR-15s out of the hands of the insane and criminally minded.\n\nBut, hey, just send out some more \"thoughts and prayers\".  That'll magically fix up your cynical motives and gross incompetence., 7 I wonder if the response would have been different had his name been Muhammad... , 7 Of course, now the GOP wants Christopher Wray to resign so that someone else will be appointed who will pull the plug on the Muller Investigation and save Trump's behind.  Pathetic., 7 Doesn't matter .... Data is clear, 7 He started like a few months ago!! Just because they want the Russia thing to stop doesn't mean this is a reason for Wray to step down. , 7 \"Mr. Scott said that Christopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., should step down and that the bureau\u2019s failure to act on the tip about Mr. Cruz was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nWhat about Mr. Scott- Stepping-Down for allowing this type of weapon to be purchased in...his...state by a teenager?, 7 Is the the governor in favor of gun control? I hope so,, 7 Too ironic that Gov. Scott is demanding the head of the FBI when it's his state law which allowed the boy to purchase the AR-15. Scott's a Republican running for the Senate though, so he'll really need those NRA $$ and trashing the FBI will further endear him to the President. Win-win, except for the country. , 7 I don't know why our country isn't marching against guns. Thousands and thousands of women gathered and descended on our nation's capital and in our metropolitan areas for the past two Januarys in protest of ... I don't know exactly. But I want to march against guns in our country! Where is the march? Where is the groundswell of support for women who get murdered by males with a rifle? I'll join that march.  , 7 Would that be the same Rick Scott who was involved in a huge Medicare fraud? He's a law and order man now?\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2010/11/rick-scott-alex-sink-f..., 7 The FBI person who quashed the investigation of the Arab flight school student who didn't care about learning to land actually ended up receiving a commendation. And we all know the Arab flight school student went on to crash an airplane onto the World Trade Center., 7 To the congressmen and women who take money from the NRA:  Is this how you serve your country, by giving guns to anyone who wants one?  By sending condolences when you are confronted with the immorality of putting assault weapons in the hands of people who could never justify owning one?  A 19-year-old walks into a school and murders 17 people and ruins the lives of hundreds of others, and you say, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with you\"? Don't you choke on that? How do you sleep at night?, 7 This lapse occurred on Donald Trump's watch.\n\nWill he take ownership of this?\n\nNOT my president, 7  If the FBI tracked him down and talked to him what then? Put him in jail? Force him to get mental health treatment? Dedicate FBI agents to monitor him 24/7? Take a look at the white supremacist and neo-Nazi sights and wonder why the FBI isn't doing something about those? What about the death threats people receive regularly on Twitter and FB - what to do about those? Chances are they are coming from people we would consider mentally ill. It's access to military style guns that's the problem., 7 Scott and Rubio, who are you talking to? Most know what the real problem is a Republican party owned by the NRA. Lies on your lips and blood on your hands., 7 Right. Like it's the FBI's fault that we have laws allowing 19 year-old boys to buy assault weapons. Besides, that post about wanting to be a \"shooter\" was just \"locker room talk,\" like our president says. , 7 Sure, let's blame it all on the FBI., 7 Shame on Rick Scott. , 7 Maybe James Comey would agree to come back. , 7 This is a terrible indictment of the FBI.\n\nAs I recall an agent in the FBI office in Minneapolis had similar and equally disturbing  information on one of the 911 hijackers, where a flight instructor had contacted them about a non-US citizen, a Muslim who only wanted to learn how to fly a plane, but didn't care a whit about taking off or landing. But when they (the MN office) tried to get the attention of the higher ups in NY and WDC it went nowhere, dying on the vine. \n\nNo matter how disingenuously motivated his comments were, perhaps Trump is right when he says that the FBI is \"in tatters\". This reads like the Keystone Cops. This news is incredibly damning. , 7 One-third of Americans will walk in lock-step behind GOP attempts to further their political agenda by blaming the FBI for this latest atrocity AND shielding their craven selves from the real and larger issue: The slaughter associated with weapons of WAR in our school and communities. \n\nOne-third!\n\nRise up, 70%ers! Shed the apathy. Let the voice of the majority translate into ACTION. Our childrens' lives depend on it. Fire every politician with an NRA rating of anything other than F.  , 7 The purpose of the second amendment was to have an armed militia to protect if necessary the new free state of America after the war of independence\n\nIt was not intended to allow redneck louts or other assorted mindless jerks to arm themselves almost two hundred and fifty years later with modern killing machines and to strut around with them in open carry or to use them to murder innocents.\n\nWAKE UP AMERICA., 7 This is a terrible lapse on the part of the FBI. The FBI is also not a substitute for effective gun control. And let's face it--Scott calling for Wray to step down is 150% because the GOP wants the country to believe that the FBI can't be trusted--on anything, but especially on Russia. Sit down and shut up, Governor. You should be ashamed of yourself., 7 Democrats put all their eggs in the wrong basket. FBI was too busy chasing the phony collusion garbage the Democrats invented after Obama dropped the ball during the election.  Maybe the Dems should be blamed for the terrible killings, not the NRA. Big wins for Republicans in 2018.  , 7 \u201cI'm going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d See the word shooter? That cannot happen without a gun. Without a gun, he is just a troubled kid with a Youtube account. , 7 Message to Florida Governor Rick Scott: No, You Quit, you filthy GOP = Greedy Oligarchic Plutocrat . . . Now is not the time to politicize the grief of the victims families and the anguish of this nation. Put Up or Shut Up and Get SOMETHING Done!, 7 Rick Scott, Governor of a state with a Stand Your Ground Law and is a place where you can buy an assault weapon as readily as a 6 pack.\nScott is now blaming the FBI, 7 So Governor Scott, who gets a \"A\" rating from the NRA, wants the FBI director to resign because some idiot said something stupid on social media. I guess the fact the a 19-year-old can legally walk out of a Florida gun shop with a semi-automatic rifle and many rounds of ammunition simply by proving that he lives in the state and can pay for the purchase lets the Governor off the hook., 7 Hello, FBI? Id like to report someone I think may become violent. \n\nOk, have they threatened you?\n\nNo. \n\nHave they threatened others? \n\nWell, they posted some stuff online -- and they own a gun \n\nGun ownership is not illegal.  \n\nWell-- \n\nand the First Amendment protects free speech. \n\nBut he -- \n\n--click----, 7 First of all... Cruz wasn't a \"Muslim\" therefore he wasn't a priority to the FBI- had somebody mentioned Cruz could possibly be an \"illegal immigrant\" .. may be the FBI then ICE- would have moved faster. It's all a sign of the times.. , 7 There are millions upon millions of nasty posts in comments all over the Internet. Death threats are a dime a dozen. The FBI is in an impossible position. , 7 Christopher Wray should resign right after Rick Scott does for running a state where **anyone** can buy a military assault gun., 7 Oh, like Cheney and Bush and 9/11, 7 Right, Scott to blame the FBI instead of demanding changes in gun laws.  \n\nPathetic.  , 7 Get your story together, NYT! Are we blaming Cruz? The FBI? Guns? Gun control? Or are we going to do that thing you like to do where you don't call white people that commit terrorist acts 'terrorists,' instead opting for 'lone wolf' or 'mentally ill.' Which you already did, expressing how people knew Cruz was mentally ill but not that he could have done so much damage -- further stigmatizing mental illness and endangering the lives of mentally ill people everywhere. I swear, if mentally ill people die because of your dangerously negligent reporting, I will find a lawyer and start a class action against the NYT. \n\nCruz is a terrorist. He committed an act of terrorism. Stop euphemising and downplaying white terrorism and report with integrity for once. , 7 We can put a man on the moon but we can't identify somebody that posted a threat on YouTube? Makes you wonder how vulnerable are nation is to terrorism.  , 7 Like when they called for George W Bush to resign when he ignored the memo: \"Osama bin Laden determined to strike in the US\" the month before 9/11?  Hypocrites!, 7 Another great opportunity for the GOP to change the subject from common sense gun control to blaming the FBI....as an added bonus it further undermines Federal law enforcement as the FBI closes in on the Colluder In Chief himself., 7 With this rationale we should ask Secretary Mattis to step down over the air force failure to report the Texas Church shooter., 7 \"Fumbled\"? Were they too focused on the non-issue of \"Black Identity Extremists\"?, 7 The FBI couldn\u2019t find the source of an unencrypted message on you-tube.  Here\u2019s a clue. The guy signed it. Hey FBI, next time hit reply and ask them where they are.  , 7 I called the FBI about an international war criminal hiding in the area. A very rude agency woman asked me if he was my boyfriend and was I mad at him. , 7 There is just not a question that it is the FBI's fault. How can these ....... bring themselves to say such ...... things. I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that so as not to offend ........ How can these ...... people bring themselves to say such ...... things.\n\nAren't we all sick of this. The one good thing is that it is happening there. Not where I live. We don't have ...... laws that create an environment that makes this inevitable.\n\nAnd we didn't vote for a ...... president and a ...... republican party that feeds on fear and bigotry., 7 The FBI missed this one, and the consequence of this oversight is the Parkland Massacre.\nThe United States Congress has the power to easily create laws that could stem access to assault rifles, and provide other timely laws that could add teeth to protecting our school aged children from gun violence.\nBut, the Congress has willfully chosen to completely ignore he cries of young people and parents who scream for the Congress to immediately act to stop this carnage.\nBut, the only concern for these coward Congressmen is to accept NRA money, so these politicians can live to see their political destinies fulfilled. Idiots like Speaker Ryan and the reminder of the Republicsn menagerie such as Mitch McConnell only listen to big NRA money.\nYes, the FBI missed this one; hopefully they can rapidly recover and establish effective detection protocols, But. They aren't slaves to the NRA and they cannot make laws to protect us.\nThat sensitive and lifesaving role belongs to  the United States Congress, and right now they are solely responsible for deaths of 17 murdered loved ones in the Parkland Massacre!, 7 Pathetic GOP tires to distract blame from the NRA to the FBI. Disgusting. The FBI gets thousands of tips about potentially disturbed people, and can't possibly track them all.\nFocus on this: Chuck Grassley blamed the inability to prevent mentally impaired people from buying weapons, yet HE HIMSELF sponsored legislation last year that REMOVED such a ban. He is the worst kind of hypocrite, as is Scott., 7 What a coward Mr Scott is. One second he's using the tried and true \"too soon\" card but instantly points the finger at the FBI as soon as he gets the chance., 7 here's what will happen.  There will be empassioned pleas for more gun control from the NYT, Schemer, and Pilosi.  Gun sales, in a slump since Obama left office, will skyrocket once again.  The fastest selling gun will remain the AR15.  People will once again start hoardng ammo, and ammunition makers will run 24 hours away to meet the demand.  NRA membership  will climb by another million. Things will slowly calm down until the next mass shooting.\n\nThe cycle will repeat.  It has happened before., 7 I hope I\u2019m wrong here but the heat on FBI Director Christopher Wray opens the door for Donald Trump to fire him; appoint a new (puppet) Director; fire Rod Rosenstein and have this person fire Robert Mueller, now that he has indicted 13 (unlucky number) Russian trolls for poisoning the 2016 election. A senseless gun tragedy in Florida may have given the president the rope he\u2019s wanted for so long to fire the special prosecutor., 7 How about you, Governor Scott with Florida\u2019s lax gun laws? How many mass shooting are going to take place in the State of Florida before you and the Florida legislature take action against the gun lobby? You are a very sorry sort yourself!, 7 I think it's disgusting and at the very least disingenuous of Rick Scott to deflect away from his state's weak gun laws and his pro-gun politics by expecting Wray to resign. Ridiculous. The person that did not follow up the lead and their supervisor are another story., 7    Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, and Marco Rubio, republican promoters for the unrestricted gun sales in the U.S., have the gall to wash their hands, find scapegoats instead? Shameful and hypocritical. Can't they look in the mirror? If honesty remains, they would be horrified to see the monster they are. Along with their entire party, no doubt. , 7 What!?  Another huge mistake by the FBI?  Why do we pay these peoples' salaries if they do not work for us?  They are literally useless., 7 Rick Scott is another GOP hypocrite. He is merely Trump's tool to get rid of Wray so he can appoint a true sycophant to run the FBI. That's why Florida was given an exception to offshore drilling. This is how dictatorships work, folks., 7 Anybody with a gun(s) has the potential to conduct a mass shooting.    All you need is to push some wrong buttons.    Stop the violence.  Get rid of the guns., 7 Oh ya, Rick Scott is morally outraged, he of Medicare fraud fame. Scott wants to talk about anything but guns. Scott is trying to get Florida doctors to stop asking patients if they have a gun.\n\nThe guy has zero credibility on this.  , 7 The people to blame are the Republican party and The NRA, who are all too happy work together to allow easy access to these deadly weapons., 7 So now it will be the FBI\u2019s fault.  Not the NRA.  \n\nHow convenient for the GOP.  I\u2019d like to see the record of the complaint please, 7 So what????  He did NOTHING to be arrested FOR, until that DAY.  Preventative incarceration, like at Gitmo????  But, he's NOT Muslim.\n  HERE is a very basic start :  NO Guns or ammunition for ANYONE under 21 years old.  NO EXCEPTIONS.  Can legally drink alcohol, but CAN buy a machine gun.  And that's exactly what it is.   Insane., 7 \"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\" Donald Trump, 1/20/17.  Yet another Trump-led administration failure. , 7 Rick Scott, the gun fetish enabler should resign. When is it our Governor's turn to take responsibility for something?, 7 Wee played Republicans, well played!! Having your cake and eating it too by:\n1. Providing cover for getting Wray to resign, thereby derailing the Russian investigation\n2. Pretending to give a hoot about mass shootings, while doing absolutely nothing to actually solve that problem.\nWell played indeed!, 7 Why doesn\u2019t Rick Scott quit? He failed to pass on the call from the Nursing Home administration that people were dying in the nursing home because they had no AC. He had specifically given out his cell phone number to the Nursing Home administration and said call him personally! \n\nThen let\u2019s put it this way Nicolas Cruz was wearing a Red Trump Make America Great Ball cap while he was shooting up his yard! So shouldn\u2019t every Trump supporter resign first!  How about the 39 local cops who showed up over the years Mr. SCott! \n\nMr. Scott you are being called out for not calling out enough is enough on any semi-automatic weapons. \n\nLest us forget if the FBI had really been doing its job you would hav.e been in in Club Feb for Medicaid fraud with HCA. , 7 Gov. Scott and Sen. Rubio are calling for the resignation of FBI Director Wray. Why? Yes, this was a stunning admission by the FBI and I am appalled to think that if the tip was investigated it could have prevented the massacre. But I don't think it could have. Freedom of speech protects Cruz's posts. He bought the assault rifle legally. Although Scott and Rubio would like to deflect the conversation, they can't. Assault type rifles need to be banned. A 19 year old should not be allowed to buy an unlimited number of guns. And those politicians who are in bed with the NRA need to be voted out of office., 7 What could the FBI have done? Heck, they couldn't even have prevented the sale of the gun to Cruz on the grounds of mental illness. , 7 And what? . . . just because you make a threat does not mean your easily purchased, mass murdering, semi-automatic weapon in America can be taken away. , 7 If the FBI did it's job, and not go working for Hillary, maybe they'd have done their job?, 7 The Republican party is truly disgusting. They're using this horrible tragedy, which THEY are responsible for (being bought and paid for by The NRA) to smear the F.B.I. and appease Donald Trump.\n\nWhat are they all hiding? Is the entire Republican party being blackmailed with kompromat? What's going on?, 7 Friends and family knew this guy was going to do this. They didn't stop him.\n\nSchool administrators in Florida knew this guy was capable of this. They didn't stop him.\n\nThe federal government received warnings about this. They didn't stop him.\n\nOh, wait - I'm talking about Osama bin Laden and 9/11. What are you guys talking about?, 7 Although law enforcement might not have been able to do anything regarding this situation, I believe this person had a document psychiatric disorder.  If a person is seen as a danger to self or others, it is possible to place an involuntary hold (5150) on that person for up to 72 hours, in order to assess and treat a mental disorder.  It's tragic to think that a missed mental health intervention opportunity might have been able to prevent this tragedy., 7 This is beyond inane. Newsflash: there have always been and there will always be crazy, messed-up, damaged people who are angry about their lot in life. Only in America do we allow them to be armed., 7 Has Rick Scott and the Florida Legislature done anything for the safety of the people of Florida since the Orlando Nightclub shooting.  Seems like they have had ample time to pass laws that would have helped reduce the possibilities of this situation happening.  The FBI let something slip by probably because this youth did not have a criminal record.  Mistake yes.  The Florida legislature could have enacted a law forbidding the purchase of automatic weapons, requiring tougher background checks, requiring youth to have recommendations from responsible community members, etc, etc.  Maybe these representatives should be owning up to their failure to act for the good of their state and resign rather than calling for the FBI head to step down.  , 7 We can't blame the law enforcers for this. We must blame the law makers. These law makers are complicit in the most hideous crimes against Americans. It's time to ask these law makers if they are on the side of the USA or that of the NRA!, 7 Gov. Scott should not be asking the head of the FBI to resign, instead he should be asking him to do a thorough investigation as to why the warning was missed. Wray has shown that he will go to any length to find the truth and that is what we need now. Also it should be noted that Cruz was very methodical in his actions, so it would have been very easy miss things until he crossed the line. If Gov. Scott wants to ask anyone to resign it should be Trump, this is not the first school shooting since Trump took office and what has he done to get the congress to open up a discussion on gun violence and gun laws, NOTHING., 7 Could this failure in the FBI have anything to do with the lack of morale in the agency due to criticism from the president and some republicans?, 7 The Miami Herald reports:\n\n\"2:19 p.m.: An Uber drops Cruz off at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. (Police said the driver had nothing to do with the crime.) Sporting a black hat, he then walked to building 12, carrying his AR-15 rifle in a soft black case. According to the arrest report, one staffer radioed a co-worker to alert authorities that Cruz was \u201cwalking purposefully\u201d toward the school.\n\nBetween 2:21 - 2:33 p.m.: Cruz goes on a killing spree in building 12 of the high school, reaching every floor.\n\nCruz entered the building (said to house mostly freshman classrooms) by the east stairs. He then fired into three classrooms \u2014 first 1215 and 1216, then 1212. He then backtracked toward the original rooms, still shooting. Next, Cruz moved toward the second floor, taking the west stairs, where he resumed firing. He then continued to the third floor via the east stairs, where he dropped his bag and his weapon, running back down. According to the arrest record, Cruz was attempting to disappear among the fleeing students.\"\n\nI mean you just can't defend yourself against a rapid-firing firearm. How many shots are in a normal handgun? At least you could attempt to disarm him while he's reloading. Or jump on his back and wrestle him if he's got a long knife. How many armed guards would be necessary to be on standby for an attacker such as this? And, still, could they get off a shot? Prisons don't have that many guards, and there the inmates' movements are restricted., 7 What could the FBI had done if they had \"followed through?\"  Since he had not committed any crime that prevented him from owning an assault weapon and had no documented mental health history, the laws prevented anyone from doing anything other than maybe follow him around.  Once again the press focuses on the sensational and misses the point - our current gun laws would not have given the FBI the authority to do anything., 7 This is nothing. Everyone should recall that the FBI field office in Arizona notified DC headquarters in the summer of 2001 that Muslims were taking flying lessons focusing on flying giant aircraft, but not takeoff and landing. There was no follow-up. Unfortunately, it's easy after a calamity to pick through the cacophony of information and say \"these were signals we should have heeded.\" At the time, they were just noise. , 7 If \"everyone at the school knew\", then why didn't the school notify the FBI or the local police of the credible school threat? No single entity owns this. It is a national failure at every level: responsible gun laws, mental health support, school support, societal support, local, state, federal government support for all these areas. No 18 year should be able to own a gun as they cannot legally drink alcohol till they are 21. There's a reason to delay access to dangerous things in life for young people. Teenagers are still emotionally fragile and remain so until later in life. Since Trump & GOP have reversed the Obama law to restrict mental health patients from purchasing guns, this problem will not end until comprehensive gun laws are put into place without eliminating the 2nd Amendment. , 7 Our third largest political party, the PNV/Party of Non-Voters makes up 48% of our electorate, and has made it possible for Donald Trump to claim the presidency, and for the Non-GOP to redistrict our much-advertised democracy into a stockholders'-free-for-all. \n\nWhile our bookstores disappear, our churches and liquor stores outnumber our public libraries, and most of us can't read or do math beyond the seventh-grade level.  The possible explanation for our political proclivities, and electoral choices -or absence thereof.\n\nRelieved of the painstaking labor of a rigorous education, our brains deflated by the weight of  mind-deadening minimum-wage non-union jobs, and paralyzed by the desperation of looming bankruptcy from mounting medical bills,  we watch TV  8 hours a day, under the puerile impression that the story it tells is that of our national history.  Thus we believe the Strong Silent Type Cowboy is the Great American Hero... \n\n...and he needs his gun to prove it., 7 The Republicans will use this tragedy to obstruct justice in the investigation of Trump.  For them it's an opportunity.  Otherwise they will do absolutely nothing to prevent this kind of crime because, as we all know, they couldn't care less., 7 I think it\u2019s obvious the FBI has lost its bearings it needs to come under heavy scrutiny and stay that way for quite a long time, 7 School officials couldn't stop this even though they knew he was a troublemaker.  Local police could not stop this, even though they had had numerous interactions with him.  Mental health professionals couldn't stop him, even though they understood him better than, probably, anyone else.  His guardians couldn't stop him, even though they saw him everyday.\n\nWhat was it that you were hoping the FBI could do based on a single on-line comment?  Do you know how many such comments appear on a daily basis?  How much of our tax money do we want to spend on following up each one.\n\nIt's easy to be right retrospectively., 7 Firstly, Rick Scott needs to take a good look in the mirror - what's happened on HIS watch in the State of Florida?  How can he live with that?\n\nBesides, this is just a thinly-veiled attempt by a DJT hand puppet to move the Director aside for OTHER reasons.  Not happening, not now with the Russian indictments., 7 The path to safer schools include:\n\n1 Profiling troublemakers\n2 Mandatory engagement and tracking by law enforcement and counselors\n3 Enacting a gun ban access and ownership until 21 for identified troublemakers\n4 Lock the doors at school starting time\n5 train and arm, compensate specific school employees, 7 Rick Scott: Medicare fraudster\nRick Scott: Climate change, rising seas denier\nHow many people will suffer or die because of his inaction?\n\nSure the FBI might have questioned this kid. But that has nothing to do with the fact that in Florida weapons of mass destruction are readily available to all. The gun worship culture and Rick Scott who won't oppose it own this massacre. , 7 If you've ever perused YouTube comments (which I try to avoid if I can) you'll see a lot of angry, violent, misogynistic males spewing hatred.\n\nWhile I'm not condoning such commentary, the internet is rife with it.\n\nThe F.B.I. does not have the time, money, manpower or jurisdiction to police all vile internet speech. The problem is with The National Rifle Association's stranglehold on our elected officials (mostly the Republicans.) The gun lobby is controlling our country., 7 \u201c.....must act flawlessly...\u201d. Now that is a pretty defined task.  Easy for an attorney general, once forbidden to enter a mall, to offer. Would it not be good to have an attorney general who has acted flawlessly, or better yet, a president., 7 While I enthusiastically support various forms of significant gun control, I just wish Times commenters showed equivalent outrage about drunk, drugged, and texting drivers who kill more people each year than gun owners do. , 7 I hope the NRA stands up and makes sure the FBI cannot follow up such incidents. Guns are made to kill, and the NRA is in favor of guns. Nothing more needs to be said., 7 What's more important to the FBI, following up on credible potential mass shooting perpetrators or trying to bring down Trump? Priorities, priorities. , 7 \"Thoughts and prayers\" don't seem to be enough.  Blaming the FBI is another distraction.  Time to try doing something (else)?\n\nGuns have no place here.  We deserve better., 7 So many lives could have been saved if only., 7 I understand the Second Amendment and its relevance in the 18th century in the Wars of Independence and later. (A considerable number of us in the UK are still struggling against the privileged English elite!) BUT, what I cannot understand is why this extends to weapons that would normally be restricted to the military? Or indeed why someone who has documented personality and anger issues be allowed to LEGALLY purchase such a weapon. How can such a great country as yours allow such as yours be taken seriously as a model for a modern society when such a distorted view of a right to bear arms take precedence over the rights of a child to a safe education. It almost reduces you to the wilds of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Taliban use such tactics to prevent girls from going to school. Also, it demeans you as a nation for your President to glibly blame it on Mental Health issues. Sort it! You are the richest country on the Planet! Provide assistance to those sufferers of mental health problems but also remove the means for them to commit suicide or a school shooting with such powerful weapons. Who on earth needs such weapons anyway?, 7 While the missed steps are tragic indeed, for Gov. Rick Scott to point blame at anyone besides himself is mind-boggling. He allows assault rifles to be sold freely and does not want checks on those with mental disorders when buying a gun or assault rifle.Mr Cruz looks a little deranged.  Didn't the store owner know when he sold him the gun that something bad would happen?  When Trump signed a bill that we can no longer deny guns to people with mental illness, didn't the Governor and others think something like this would happen? Probably, but Gov. Scott supported that bill and now wants to deflect blame on the FBI.  Republicans look more and more ridiculous all the time., 7 The Director should resign right after president trump resigns. , 7 Maybe the problem is not in weapons? Can the problem be in the education system? You can kill with a hammer, the main thing is who gave it to you in hand., 7 It is important to know how many tips there are that are of similar gravity that do not end up with the person being targeted actually planning or executing an attack.\nIf every tip leads to a successful prevention of an attack, then there has been a terrible lapse in the FBI.\nIf one in a million similar tips lead to a real attacker but the rest do not (the \"noise\" in the system), then it is hard to imagine what the FBI could have done.\nI'm assuming that the number is somewhere in between, but without that information it is impossible to form a judgment, as opposed to reaction to a presupposition., 7 The FBI does not make gun control policy and their organization is comprised of exceptional talent - but I'm sorry - a posting on youtube that states, \u201cIm going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d  is not just a failure of action - its a failure of duty and common sense.\n\nAnd despite the \"overwhelming majority of instances\" the FBI is doing good work - this one should have been a no-brainer. Yes, I'm afraid there's blood on the FBI's doorstep for this one., 7 Typical politicians approach to point blame away from them. Yes the FBI missed something. However, our politicians have fail to protect our citizens from gun violence. They have not taken on the gun lobby because they pay our politicians off. , 7 How quickly Senator Rubio and Governor Scott clutch their pearls and point fingers at the FBI! The facts remain, though. Mr. Cruz bought and possessed his weapons and ammunition legally. His \u201cdisturbing\u201d internet posts were also legal. They apparently did not target any specific individual(s) and are considered free speech. It is much harder to commit someone to a mental institute against their will than people seem to think. My family has had a few \u2018there but for the grace of God go we\u2019 incidents, and I well remember the panic I experienced when I realized that despite all we tried, legally we were helpless until our relative actually broke the law. Thank God we escaped a tragedy (sadly my relative committed suicide; but at least he is no longer a danger to anyone). It truly is the easy, legal availability of weapons that is the problem. If only we could have gotten the guns out of my relative\u2019s possession, how much easier we would have slept! Revive the Assault Weapon Ban, and close the loopholes, if you value your children\u2019s lives., 7 I hate this article's implications.  The FBI could not have done anything substantive to have stopped this, since Cruz had already bought his AR-15 a year prior and there is not legal avenue for confiscating it in the state of Florida.  Plus, he had never been adjudicated \"mentally ill,\" and furthermore, the Republican Congress and current POTUS signed protections into law for the mentally ill to purchase weapons.  So what would the FBI have done?  There are still civil liberties other than the right to own guns.  , 7 Rick Scott needs to go ... he is responsible for Florida\u2019s lax gun laws. He fawns all over Trump ... sometimes for the good of Florida ( no oil drilling in Florida!). Because of His friendship with DJT he would call for Wrays firing.... His motives are not to be trusted. Anything to detract from the gun reform that\u2019s needed. His term is thankfully about up but he wants to run for the senate, hopefully he will not succeed ., 7 Unfortunately, this makes DT's remark that the FBI's 'reputation is in tatters' more on the mark., 7 Accessories to 17 murders?\n\nAlso, weren't they tipped off re flight schools prior to 9-11 as well?, 7 Typical GOP - pass the buck to Wray. They need to take responsibility for not passing gun control legislation, 7 The Governor of Florida is using the deaths of 17 people in an attempt to curry favor from Donald Trump by trying to get rid of Wray?\n\nPure class., 7 There aren't enough cops and FBI agents to track down every nut who says he's going to shoot up a school or a mall. We need to interpret the 2d Amendment as it was written: \"well-regulated.\" Of course, Trump will now blame this massacre on the FBI, so as to keep discrediting a legitimate arm of the government and thus avoid scrutiny of his numerous misdeeds. So long as anyone can get a gun, we will continue to see innocent blood spilled. , 7 The Times is doing a huge disservice to the agonized victims of this terrible tragedy, and of the understanding of this tragedy, by reporting on the FBI's astounding failure in the context of the Mueller probe and the consequent Democratic-Republican divisions. At best, these should have been minor dimensions.   , 7 What a convenient deflection for Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican Congress and Pres Trump who want the FBI gone and to continue to promote the sale of assault rifles. , 7 It's amusing to hear the same people who screamed \"They're coming to take your guns!\" for eight years now screaming about the FBI because they didn't come take away someone's gun., 7 If you\u2019re going to have a country flooded with guns, with no measures whatsoever to restrict their use, your law enforcement game better be tight., 7 Obviously, a brazen, and desperate, move by Scott, to change the subject away from what his puppet masters abhor, iron clad gun registration.  , 7 I never knew our government has a minority report program... I'm curious what the FBI could have done even if they did pursue this man.  I think this shows the hypocrisy and spineless nature of republicans.  Republicans have a very easy time pointing fingers and blaming everyone else but themselves.  You're talking about a party that'll bend over backwards to protect the gun industry and, when it comes to mass shootings, they conveniently deflect and avoid any talk of gun control.  Clearly this move to get rid of the FBI director has nothing to do with the shooting and everything to do with the Trump investigation.  Yea, there's sick people in this world that won't hesitate to hurt as many people as possible, but republicans provide the device that allows that person to kill with such ease. And with the same ease, they blame the other guy. , 7 No one in leadership in America at the national level has ever taken this problem serious, or seriously enough.\n\nThe assumption has been, well, there's really nothing we can do about it. That's wrong.\n\nThese mass shooting events, in schools and elsewhere, have been escalating in number and victims over the last ten to fifteen years. We (the US govt.) spent three or four trillion dollars** reacting to 9-11, 2001, when 3,000+ were killed by terrorists from overseas, but we act as though we are helpless in this case.\n\nThe latest Florida massacre makes it clear there is much that can be done. What we lack is the willingness to take action based on the belief that it will be successful. We argue with each other and focus on gun control, which is at the end of the cycle of violence, not the start.\n\nWe need to cut down on the number of mass murder events little by little. When we do that, the diminishment of the contagion of violence will likely discourage others from taking up the gun. It is a long process, perhaps ten years or more, to slow and stop this madness, but taking no action or half measures is no longer an option.\n\n**I am counting the money spent on two wars plus the money spent on counter-terrorism and security measures as part of the overall total., 7 Any supervisors losing a job?, 7 Scott wants Wray to resign?  Wray wasn't even with the FBI until July, 2017, and  wasn't answering the tip line in January.  That's a Trump inspired call by Scott who wants to be the Senator from FL, Trump's personal Senator, 7 The people who should step down are the members of the House and Senate who refuse to ban assault weapons and strengthen regulations governing the sale of guns and ammunition.  If \"guns don't kill people, people kill people\" then the people who are responsible for these killings are those who oppose such sensible and pressing legislation. Shame on them!, 7 The Florida Governor did nothing to curb gun sales in Florida.\nHe should resign., 7 Politicians seem to always boil problems down to who gets a political advantage. \n\nGun control? Who is kidding who? , 7 Perhaps Governor Scott ought to add his name to the list of officials who need to resign.  On the Governor's watch, the State of Florida permitted the sale of a semi-automatic weapon, with no waiting period, to a teenager with known psychiatric problems who had been expelled from high school because of troubling behavior.    , 7 if Wray goes so will Scott. it happened in his State under his watch. , 7 Right or wrong, I\u2019d say Director Wray\u2019s tenure is coming to a close. , 7 Gov Scott has a problem with the FBI?  Is that the same Governor Scott that has an 'A+' rating from the NRA? Is it the same Governor Scott that has introduced zero gun-control legislation in FL? Is it the same Governor Scott that introduced at least 5 pro-gun bills since his tenure began? Americans want gun control, in fact we're going to demand it in November. Vote democratic if you want to live. , 7 How insane to make the FBI Director a scapegoat.  Why not the Broward County Sheriff whose officers made many visits to Cruz home.  Or the school principal?   Or the gun shop?  Or maybe we should look at the Governor who did nothing after the previous mass shootings except offer condolences and prayers.  \n\nIn fact, each shooting begets more shootings and will until we do the one thing that really would interrupt this vicious cycle, which is actually restricting access to guns, especially semi-automatic rifles.  , 7 Governor scott and Pres. trump are best friends. scott hopes that he will replace Senator Nelson in the Senate as he is (thank God) term-limiting out the fall. Of course scott is demanding that the FBI's Director Wray resign. He is beholden to trump, he is beholden to the NRA.\n\nHow about it Governor scott, how about outing the NRA and pushing for gun control? , 7 Whew! It's a relief to know that just like the Air Force is to be blamed for the Texas church shooting, the FBI is to be blamed for this Florida school shooting. Lax gun laws have nothing to do with it. Don't get me wrong: we love our military and we love our police. But if the choice is between them and our guns, we're choosing our guns. , 7 I observed similar menacing behavior perpetrated by the now ex-husband of a close family member. Telling her 'it would be a shame if something happened to her and their son would grow up without a mother' didn't rise to an actionable offense. Until such time as he shot her or sunk a knife into her, nothing could be done.\n\nI know a number of women who could tell this exact same story. Wishing somebody dead or desiring their demise isn't enough to get you arrested and charged with a crime, let alone convicted and incarcerated., 7 Politicians have to blame someone other than the perpetrator or they would have no accomplishments., 7 I'm sure Congress and the President welcome the opportunity to blame the FBI and take the focus off themselves where it really belongs.  The cowardly elected officials are the ones who do NOTHING to insure the safety of our children when we send them off to school.  Does anyone really think that working on the problem of mental health would do as much to protect the citizenry as banning assault weapons and tightening gun purchase requirements?, 7 This actually demonstrates the futility of trying to prevent gun violence by identifying and stopping the criminals in advance of the crime. It's rare that such tips are made\u2014and even if they are, there are many reasons why the tips may never be acted on. Even had the FBI investigated in this case, there's no guarantee that they would have found enough evidence of a crime to be able to take the guns of the shooter away or to prevent him from going forward with the shooting. As long as it is legal for Americans to possess these kinds of guns, some Americans will use them for murder. Trying to predict ahead of time which Americans will turn out to be the murders and then stop them in advance is a near impossible task. Much more effective to do what other countries have done: ban the means of killing. , 7 Stop already with the off-point deflections: we need to prohibit all civilian access to military-style weapons, now.\nThe FBI cannot protect us from ourselves. The FBI is fallible and human and makes mistakes. (Don't forget the botched identification of 9/11 perpetrators.)\nOur obligation is to toss out of office any legislator who will not work toward a 100% ban on military weapons for civilians., 7 I'm gonna repeat this, like when people kept warning about the shooter but people ignored it.\n\nThat's really nice of the FBI. I'm not being sarcastic. They are taking the blame for what the local community should have done. It's the same old story, look it up, review the press coverage of the incidents. They always blame someone else for the failure to act, effectively.\n\nIf you know someone who might be a shooter, like this kid, just talk to him.  Simple.  It's like doing your duty.  It depends on the love or affection you have for your classmates or fellow employees.  It worked for me, not to suggest that I was a potential shooter.  The other guy was.  It's like the draft.  Sometimes you just have to take a risk for others., 7 The FBI Wil most likely learn from this and get better. I  wish I could say the same for our elected officials, the NRA, and the citizens of our country that continue to offer thoughts & prayers and no action. To those who actually want to create real change and save lives? I say to you, follow the money and VOTE THEM OUT., 7 What do you think the FBI could have done, even if they brought him in for questioning? He owned the gun legally, he could deny that he intended any harm, and there may have been zero evidence that he was going to do anything dangerous. \n\nThat's the point. Those who are in the business of screening people who might be dangerous know there is no crystal ball. The best predictor for future action, is past action. So if a person's first prominent action is mass murder? Well, too late now. And the options for action? Arrest? He has not done anything yet. Psychiatric hospitalization? What are the resources for that in Florida? Or in most states? And even if you commit him, he'll be out in a week or two. Are you going to take away his gun then? Maybe, but it is easy to buy guns illegally.  Plus, he still wants to kill people. Psychiatric treatment doesn't stop people from wanting to kill people. \n\nThese are not preventable events sometimes, unless you take away the gun. If you give AR-15's to millions of people, there will be some who will use them to kill people. They are very efficient killing devices, so these will be mass murders.\n\nWe need to stop giving everyone assault weapons. , 7 I am less concerned that the FBI potentially dropped the ball than I am with the ease that a member of the public can purchase a weapon whose purpose is to be able to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible., 7 The question I haven't heard anybody asking (and I keep asking myself) is:\nAside from the unbelievably immoral laws allowing ANYBODY to purchase a weapon that should only belong in the military, why oh why isn't the person making the sale not required to report it to the local law enforcement authorities?  Isn't it plain common sense to question why any civilian -  a teenager yet - might want to buy an AR-15?  What possible use could he have for that kind of weapon, other than to kill as many people as possible in as little time as possible.  Short of banning the sale of such weapons (please explain THAT, Congress), shouldn't such a sale at least raise a red flag? It sure isn't for defense purposes (not to mention the 30 others found in the killer's house, where and when did he get those?)   But of course, reporting the sale of weapons of mass destruction (which is what these are) would be considered an infringement on an individual's right to privacy.  Never mind that I don't have such a right when it comes to my Internet, e-mail, or telephone calls usage.  Oh no, that is perfectly justified, right?   We gotta keep an eye on the real terrorists., 7 Ah yes, the government blunders, so let's talk about imposing even more gun control on law-abiding citizens living under their Constitutional rights., 7 The Trump Administration will jump on this faster than you can say \"AR-15\". This will serve as justification to clean house at the FBI in an attempt to again thwart the momentum of the Russian investigation. This doesn't change the need for reformation of gun safety in the country but will serve as a convenient excuse not to pursue it. Blame it (again) all on the FBI.  , 7 This was everyone's fumble...most of all, however, that of the Governor's management of the state PD and social services.\nWhere was HE and HIS when the kid needed help to begin with? Like most things GOP:\n\"What, me worry?\", 7 I would like to see Marco Rubio and Governor Scott investigate the Miami FBI office  for this mishandling and see whether this is standard practice for Broward County and other places in Florida.  To add this to GOP smokescreen outrage over Wray or the Mueller investigations makes them appear to be dupes of the current regime and even party to the undermining of our electoral system and constitution.  Are such leaders helpful or effective?  I don't think so., 7 Even in the midst of another preventable gun tragedy, these despicable Republicans don't miss a beat. Should this grave error by the FBI be investigated? Of course, but that alone won't be enough to prevent the next tragedy. By placing the blame at the feet of the FBI, they accomplish two things. They avoid any discussion about sensible gun control and how one year ago the Toddler in Cheif signed legislation that \"protected\" the severely mentally ill from being entered into the FBI Database. At the same time, it gives them the opportunity to further undermine the credibility of the Agency and call for the registration of Christopher Ray. \n\nInterestingly enough, Chuck Grassley is now on record saying we need to do more to ensure that the names of the mentally ill become part of the FBI Database. He was one of the leaders on the bill, signed into law by Trump, that prevents that from actually happening. , 7 It takes a village to raise a child...so, it\u2019s the FBIs fault?  What crime had he committed prior?  Seems rather convenient to me as there were many others much closer to this individual with more influence that could have done something., 7 The resignation of an FBI director will not stop this tragic destruction. What will stop is out facing that fact that many of our systems are broken. We have a government at all levels that is working for someone other than the people.\nChuck Todd said it well on Boston Public Radio. If we had 18 air crashes between Jan 1 and Feb 13, do you think we'd see hearings in congress?, 7 FBI pro-tip: if you want them to investigate and follow up and protect people, the following best practices are 100% proven:\n\n- Tell them your info is coming from the DNC, GPS Fusion, a retired foreign spy, an active foreign spy who heard some lower level staffer say something while drunk at a bar, or the Clinton Campaign. The FBI loves these kinds of sources! They\u2019re way more credible than links to known terrorists, witnesses who see something highly disturbing, and known connections to terrorist organizations. \n\n- Tell them the event that\u2019s about to happen is somehow tied to preventing someone who they disagree with politically from attaining office. We know from FBI texts that political meddling is of utmost importance at the FBI! Preventing mass murder? Not so much. So lead with what they love! \n\n- And last but not least, suggest to the FBI that the target is Trump. He\u2019s like they\u2019re public enemy number 1. Just imagine how many of those kids\u2019 lives could have been saved if the FBI thought that Nikolas Cruz had connections to the Trump campaign! They might have done their job! \n\nSo please, when trying to get the intrepid, diligent, and highly professional men and women of the FBI to help protect children from mass murderers, just follow the advice above and all will be well. Kids died in Broward not because the FBI failed, but because the people who were trying to notify the FBI failed. , 7 Lest we forget, the psychiatrist who treated James Holmes warned a campus police sergeant about one her patients. The officer said she couldn't do anything until he'd done something illegal. It took 82 victims in a movie theater for law enforcement to get involved. , 7 This is infuriating.  That the Republican party, looking for a way to divert the conversation from gun control, would use this tragedy as a means to make the FBI the bad guys.  It's purely a political ploy to continue their attempt to close down the Mueller investigation!, 7 Maybe the Bureau would have caught it if they weren't constantly under attack by their President, and forced to change leaders unexpectedly last year. , 7 Certainly the FBI made a mistake here, but asking Chris Wray to resign would be about the worst outcome from this tragedy.  Instead, Florida Governor Rick Scott should resign and save everyone the continued embarrassment.  Most helpful would be for this country to adopt common sense gun regulations, which the majority of citizens support, despite the NRA paying congress to vote otherwise., 7 The FBI does get lots of pucks thrown their way.  Google, Amazon, Facebook and other big database miners get lots of info too.  The difference?  They work at it, and corral the data effectively for their respective purposes.  The FBI's tech \"abilities\" are a comparative joke.  Look no further for a prime example of why government is not the best provider of most services that you can imagine.  , 7 Our elected representatives just dodged a bullet\n\nIn particular, Senators who accept MILLIONS of dollars from the NRA.\n\nIn particular Senators:\n\nMcCain\nBurr\nBlunt\nTillis\nGardner\nRubio\nErnst\nPortman\nYoung\nand Cassidy.\n\nThey have blood on their hands because, ultimately, they are the only ones who can effect change.\n\nTo blame in full the F.B.I. and a failure to recognize mental health issues, is shameful, it\u2019s passing the buck.\n\nIf our elected representatives want to have millions of dollars in their campaign coffers, they should play the lotto. That way they will not be beholden to an organization, the NRA, that does not value human life, and chalks up murder as the cost of doing business., 7 The FBI is not the real problem here; they're just a convenient deflection of who and what is really responsible., 7 \"an unusually sharp rebuke of his own agents,\" \"relentless criticism for political bias,\" \"Congress needed to conduct a full oversight investigation of the FBI's processes\" \"investigate how the FBI mishandled this tip\"\n\nIt's unbelievable the depths to which the Republicans in Congress have stooped, We should expect such actions from President Trump, who has proven himself beyond doubt to be both an unintelligent hypocrite and a egoist only concerned with his self-interest and self-image. But, these Congressmen continue to relentlessly tear down the image of the FBI and present it as an inept political machine for the Democratic Party -- and we should expect better from the so-called leaders of our nation. They do not care what lasting damage will be wrought, nor do they care about the ethics behind blaming the deaths of 17 individuals on the FBI. All they care about is discrediting the nation's foremost law agency enough so that they can disregard its findings when the inevitable conclusions of Mueller's investigation are reached. This is all they care about: having a Republican in office so that they can subvert the courts, upend the taxation system, and eventually demolish Medicaid and Social Security.\n\nThese craven politicians don't care about the truth. They don't care about whether or not Russia interfered in our election to aid Donald Trump. All they want is to maintain their political power and slash benefits for the poor, and there's nothing that is off the table., 7 This is not about the FBI. It is about guns, millions of guns. It is not about mental illness. It is about guns, millions of guns. Our law makers have failed to protect the citizens of this country. Our tax dollars pay for their protection, not ours. If they, do not care about helpless children they do not care about anything. Except, of course, their pocketbooks. , 7 I see a very disturbed, lost, deeply sad,  bullied, abandoned and angry young man living in a hyper-violent society, in one of the most violent states. with no guidance after his mother sickened and died.  The motivation to carry out a violent act was clearly present. \n\nThe schools washed their hands of him which just made the situation worse.  He was a time bomb waiting to explode and since Florida likes its 18 year olds to have assault weapons and all the ammunition they want, he had the capacity and opportunity to do what he did. \n\nThere is plenty of blame to go around; the FBI can just get in line., 7 Happy to see so many people aren't falling into Trump's trap of blaming the FBI.  That is for the gullible.  Yes, in an ideal world, the FBI should have prevented this shooting.  But the Bureau receives thousands of such threats and cannot possibly investigate every one to an end point of being able to stop a shooting. \n\nFormerly I worked in a presidential library.  I was astounded to learn just how many death threats a president gets in a week.  One, of course, was carried out, despite the FBI having researched it.\n\nThe problem is guns, the legality of guns, guns in the hands of the mentally ill and immature school children. Trump weakened the law against the mentally ill buying guns.  The FBI is not God.  Without cooperation from U.S. citizens to stop the proliferation of guns, these massacres will simply continue.  Congress can't handle it, so throw them out and get some people in there with some basic first grad ethics who will start to deal with this problem.  \n\nChristopher Wray is the new scapegoat.  Shame on Rick Scott for blaming Christopher Wray.  Where was Scott when this occurred?   Why wouldn't he answer Wolf Blitzer's multiple direct question, \"Will you support gun control?\" Can it be the NRA won't give him any more money if he does answer yes?\nEasy to blame Wray.  Who will be the next Republican scapegoat to deflect attention from the real issue?  There's blood on hands, all right, but not on Christopher Wray's.\n\nThat good old Monday morning quarterback., 7 Can we stop blaming the FBI for everything please? Yes they missed the tip, and it is tragic what happened, but they are still a fantastic agency! They have had  a rough few months. The would not have had probable cause to arrest him anyway, he did not break any laws until pulled out the gun and starting shooting. Perhaps, there should have been some intervention on the parents side. Also I heard that the police had been called on this guy previously, and local law enforcement couldn't do anything then so what makes you think the FBI could have done anything? And also, if they had acted and that isn't what played out...they would have also been scrutinized , 7 The gall of Governor Scott to call for Mr. Wray's firing. Scott supported the 19 year old gunman's right to buy the semi-automatic weapon. He should be voted out of office in 2018!, 7 Let's not avert from real issue of gun control. \n\nIf we're really playing this game, let's place blame where blame is due: NRA, to start off with. I still have faith in the FBI because I'm sure that for every missed warning, there are a hundred that have been deterred. Unfortunately, the nature of their job makes even one mistake catastrophic. Let's make their - and our - lives a little bit easier by focusing on the real issue at hand and hopefully solving it once and for all. , 7 If we put the dots together, Gov. Scott is currently considering a run for the Senate this year. His calling for the termination of Mr. Wray as FBI Director falls right into the Trump acolytes who want to disrupt any semblance of belief and trust into our law enforcement institutions. It probably sets Scott up for Trump-led rallies on behalf of his candidacy in the fall.\n\nOne phone call that was not followed up on properly would not necessarily have resulted in the shooter\u2019s arrest. His gun was legally purchased, his mental health would not have resulted in his incarceration, nor even in his institutionalization. Noneteless, this oversight was an error for which the FBI has apologized.\n\nThis tragic incident cannot be blamed on any single source. It is also the combination of incredibly lax gun laws, and the power that the NRA has over Trump and mainly GOP politicians who refuse to consider any legislation to curb the sale of AR-15s and bump stocks. How many Columbines, Sandy Hooks, and Parklands must we witness before we get legislative action to eliminate ownership of these weapons?\n., 7 The FBI needs to clean house and get its act together.  FBI Agents apparently spent time to personally travel to the home of the Mississippi man who reported a threat, despite the fact that his initial report contained literally everything he knew about the threat; those same agents apparently never even took basic steps to investigate the IP  and account associated with the comment, which was the shooter's real name.  To me, that suggests the FBI is more concerned with appearing to do their job rather than actual substantive investigation that produces results. \n\nThe FBI's failure to follow through on the second report--which sounds like one of the most high-priority type of reports that could exist, especially given how much they would have found out if they conducted a minimal follow through by correlating that report with local police records and contacting Cruz's school, etc.--is completely inexcusable.  It seems like even an FBI Barney Fife should have found enough information substantiating that tip to ring louder alarms if he made any legitimate effort.  Was the second tip (which included a name) even connected to the first tip (which also included the same name)?  What steps were actually taken?  How could the FBI get two reports with names attached to them, the school know of the issues, and yet no concrete prevention?\n\nLaw enforcement can be a difficult job and certainly not all tragedies are preventable but this one was about as preventable as they come.  , 7 Rick Scott should step down for once again moving the focus away from gun control to a straw man. Yes, the FBI may have tragically mishandled the case, but that merits an investigation and disciplinary action, not the resignation of the director.\n\nAnd by the way, Scott should step down for not standing up to the sugar barons who are destroying our state\u2019s rivers, water supply and the environment in general., 7 Gun free zones and no security attract these people. Shouldn\u2019t we spend the money to hire guards for our students?  It might be a short term solution, but it is a solution. , 7 It seems that up until now conservatives had always used the argument of not politicizing mass shooting tragedies, only to protect the NRA and their funding of political campaigns. Now they have not only flipped on that position, but are doing so only for personal gain by discrediting a much needed thorough investigation on the Trump ties to the Russian meddling. To use a frequent word in the president's tweets: sad. , 7 I'd be curious to see how many attacks, assaults or \"events\" were prevented or stopped in the past few years.  I am guessing more than a few.  \n\nRegardless, the gutting of mental health services and the ease that weapons can be obtained are a lethal combination for any agency to try to keep up with.  I am sure the law enforcement community appreciates having the finger pointed at them by elected \"officials\" who are all too willing to deflect responsibility and blame onto others.  , 7 Perhaps if we had good gun control legislation, it would have been easier for the FBI to follow up on tips of threats that might result in a mass shooting? How many of those tips do they get in a day and how many are credible? I understand from other news that Cruz had acquired the gun legally, that his foster parents required he kept it in a locked box, and that he gave them no troubling signals at all. How on earth is it possible that a 19-year old can legally acquire an assault gun in the first place?, 7 All the comments here about deflection and diversion, as if focusing on one aspect of this tragedy automatically negates or downplays everything else that has factored into this shooting...\n\nThe predictable GOP spin aside, nothing can be further from the truth. The FBI did not do its job here. We need to hold the authorities accountable if we are to make any inroads at all to this crisis. We can work both toward gun control and making sure our surroundings are as safe as possible in the meantime. The threats are out there \u2014 constantly. Don\u2019t you want to be assured that they are being taken seriously? , 7 Why not get an FBI Director from a temp. agency?, 7 17 are dead because Mr. Scott did nothing to keep AK-15's out of the hands of Floridians.\n17 are dead because Mr. Scott failed to provide adequate background checks to prevent a mentally ill man from obtaining an AK-15.\nHe does not even acknowledge these failures.\nAn apology is  NOT enough.\nThe governor needs to resign., 7 The missing piece of context: How many similar tips does the FBI get on an annual basis?, 7 No mention of gun control in Florida by the governor. Will he listen to the students and their parents? I hope so., 7 This is a real FBI \"scandal\", unlike the corrosive fake scandal about an FBI conspiracy against Trump. But if Governor Scott's call for FBI Director Wray to resign is paid heed to, then almost certainly Governor Scott, a firm NRA backer should resign first., 7 Another one of Trump's lapdogs leads the call for Wray to resign. Scott has Trump's senate endorsement of him in his sites. How about weak representatives who bow and scrape to the NRA resign first. That should include Scott after his weak-kneed interview on CNN yesterday when questions of NRA pressure were raised. Proverbial deer in the headlights., 7 Who should resign is every politician who takes money from the NRA and then votes to block sensible gun control laws, including a complete ban on assault weapons (for which there is no legitimate non-military use).  That this child was troubled was clear, and he should never have been able to buy assault weapons. No one should.  This deflection of blame will not stand, Mr. Scott.  Look in the mirror.\n\nCarlosG, 7 I'm glad the FBI is being transparent but how much more difficult for the families of the victims to know it could have been prevented, 7 Rick Scott is thrilled at the news.  Now he doesn't have to even pretend he's thinking about potentially pushing for gun control measures.  He can just follow Trump's lead and bully the FBI., 7 Rick Scott  -  the same guy who had to resign as chief executive of Columbia/HCA amid a controversy over the company's business and Medicare billing practices.  And he has the gall to say the FBI director should resign.  Google this guy....hardly a law abiding citizen., 7 This should not be news which blames the FBI in this headline.  This is the standard script in many cases of violence.  The students themselves knew and predicted this.  What is law enforcement to do if not law has yet been broken?\nFollow him 24/7?  Wives who fear their husband's violence predict this on a regular basis.  It is common.  , 7 If there weren't so many guns all over the place, the FBI would be better able to follow up on every lead.  That doesn't excuse them this time.  But the Republicans who are blaming the FBI should also be blaming themselves., 7 Do we really need Russians to create distractions from the real issue(s)? We have a homemade force of professional distraction-artists, aka the GOP who can divert any issue with their \"whataboutisms\" and blame throwing.\n\nIt is likely that the FBI gets several such warnings every week by the crazies, they cannot realistically scale. But it can be easily prevented by closing these gaping holes in the system. We have real world examples where it has worked if these guys are willing to open their eyes., 7 It is the fault of the FBI. Great. Problem solved. \n\nIt is horrible. These people must want it to happen. They insist on maintaining an environment that has exactly these consequences.\n\nI am fortunate to live in an environment where we don't encourage this kind of behaviour. If you don't  do something about it, it won't stop., 7 Chris Wray is not the problem.  Attacking him is just Republicans looking for a scapegoat.  The problem is the lack of common-sense gun control legislation, and that is due to Republicans doing the bidding of the NRA.\nIf the FBI was not constantly being criticized by Trump and his supporters, and pulled away from their core work, they'd have more time to track down these leads.  The white supremacist groups would be a great place to focus more attention - they are linked to Charleston, SC and Parkland, FL. , 7   With agents like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page it dosen't surprise me that the FBI fumbled the call.  \n\n\"The FBI ain't what she used to be. Many long years ago\".  ( sung to the tune of 'The Old Gray Mare ).\n\nAnother commentor mentioned gun control, I have to agree, no military weapons in the hands of civilians., 7 Really? The FLorida governor wants the director of the FBI to quit because of a single mistake in a field office? How about calling for the President to quit because of mistakes made by his cabinet secretaries? Yes, lives were lost and is not the same thing as abusing power, defrauding expense accounts, and simple ineptitude, but really!\n\nThe issue is not the lapse, because mistakes -- even horrible ones -- happen. THe issue is what to do to prevent this and the answer is clear: no weapons like the AR-15 in the hands of anyone. If you're worried about the government coming to get you, leave the United States. You know, love it or leave it, as the crazy conservatives say to liberals. , 7 I hate to see this episode used by the lying Republican establishment to discredit the Russian probe, but it does remind me of how the FBI failed egregiously in heading off the 9/11 attacks -- even though there was solid information of something afoot that flowed into FBI headquarters, information that was ignored. And no one in the FBI was ever held accountable for that epic failure to act., 7 Let's see, our elected officials offer \"thoughts and prayers\" but are incapable of controlling the proliferation of guns in this country so we blame the FBI.   , 7 Perhaps we expect too much from the F.B.I. Trying to tell who, from 326,766,748 U.S. citizens, is capable of carnage is bound to fail. Perhaps we are in need of a new solution? Perhaps a constitutional refinement calling military assault weapon fetish for what it is, and limiting the firepower an individual can poses to a reasonable caliber.  , 7 Very sorry, hate to go there, but someone must. Where were the adults with whom Cruz lived or with whom he interacted most frequently?\n\nIt is not possible for someone in his late teens to finance and hide that many weapons and that much ammunition without the help or forbearance of the people with whom he lived. No adult ever cleaned his bedroom, looked in a closet, or checked the garage?  No one in the family was concerned when he killed animals with guns? Where did they think he would go when that was no longer satisfying?\n\nWhen you look at most of these shooter incidents one thing you find in common is that shooters are surrounded by family and close friends who must have been as observant as dreaming sheep. \n\nYes, Cruz and his ilk should have been better investigated, yes mental health in the US is inept, yes Cruz should not have been allowed to buy the gun, and YES adults in his life...the people with whom he lived, and others who knew him best....have a large share of responsibility for not connecting dots and taking action.\n\nThere absolutely must not be a God because no God would allow such inept people to conceive, or become responsible such children.  , 7 Gov. Rick Scott calls for the FBI director to resign?  Disingenuous, at best.  How about the President and a whole bunch of Republican congresspeople resign, and we can get on with addressing gun control the way we should have years ago?, 7 Who is surprised, certainly I am not. \n\nWhen an organization gets distracted from its core mission, errors will be made. \n\nSpending all your time sending love notes and conspiring to exonerate a presidential candidate means other tasks will go undone.\n\nComey is a political hack and deserved to be fired.\n\nThe FBI needs to refocus on its purpose!\n\n3:17 EST , 7 Mr. Scott's return payment for Trump excluding his state from having it's waters fouled by offshore drilling., 7 Only in the age of Executive Time Trump does the concept that an organization with 30,000 employees can only do one thing at a time fly., 7 So they should have forwared the information to their Miami field office.  And then what?  If you're going to allege that the FBI might have been able to prevent the attack, you should say how exactly they could have done that.\n\nThe shooter didn't do anything before the attack that he could have been arrested for.  Florida also doesn't have any law allowing for a temporary \"gun restraining order\", which would have allowed for him to be disarmed based on his mental health status.\n\nDo we think the FBI should have shadowed him 24/7, ready to spring into action once he started shooting?, 7 I really hope someone loses their job over this.  Calls like this should be followed up on.  Think of all the lifelong misery the parents of these students could have been spared.  Trump's comment of people reporting these things directed at that community is no longer operational.  The FBI should be issuing a profound apology., 7 It's a matter of ethics and legality but I think social media companies should be held responsible.\n\nBetween Facebook and Google, 30,000 new employees are being hired to curate content . . . This is something that should have been pointed out.\n\nThe FBI should have kept a watch on him and inquired into his activity. Videos of this monster parading around with guns of all shapes and sizes does society no good.\n\nAssault and automatic weapons have no place in society. The Second Amendment was created by the best thinkers accounting for those times, but we have evolved and so should this., 7 Everyone is missing the point, WHY?  I would guess that the majority of these school shooters have played the Military video games that TEACH them how to clear a room. These games were created for Military tactics. All it takes is one very troubled teen playing this day in and day out for a long period, and it's created a desire to clear a room by any means necessary - an assault rifle. , 7 It would be unreasonable and unfeasible to add every mentally ill and socially inappropriate person in our country to a data base to be searched when they want to buy a gun. That isn't the answer to ensuring that everyone's 2d Amendiment right to own a murderous toy is guaranteed. Instead, the burden of proof should be on the potential gun owner to prove he or she is sane. Although that might be expensive, involving submitting to a thorough psychological exam approved by an insurance company insuring the liability of the potential gun owner, it isn't impossible. That would shift the burden of the risk to the gun owner, not the innocent bystanders. Of course the NRA overlords would not allow it., 7 It is time to ask all those responsible gun owners I hear about to step up and accept a great deal more regulation.\n\nThe burden should be on the potential gun owner- not on everyone else.\n\nOne wonders where all these responsible gun owners have been all these years.  It is almost as if they do not even exist., 7 Rubio is correct.  An investigation is justified.  Scott is wrong - how despicable to turn this tragedy into a political pro-Trump football.  Mr. Wray needs to stay at his post to find out what happened at the Miami field office and in Jackson, and then be tasked to fix it., 7 In Australia, April 1996 a 28 year old mentally unhinged  man opened fire on a crowd of innocent people with a range of military assault weapons, killing 35 ,injuring another 24.\n\nThe response : The perpetrator Martin Bryant has been locked up for life. The problem was addressed. Semi automatic weapons and some other categories were banned, and the government embarked on a gun buy back scheme program.\nDid it work? Well Australia has not had any mass shootings since.\n\nThe key issue was addressed. Our lawmakers did something other than resort to prayer, blame inadequacy of law enforcement services, mental health services etc. Australian politicians have the guts to make hard decisions to protect the community as well as individuals. It is a matter of doing what is correct., 7 If we're going to start asking people to resign for not doing their job, we can start with Congress who didn't extend the assault weapons ban., 7 On the moment Russian investigation is getting bigger, this happens. Now perfect timing for FBI to be discredited and convenient to fire its director. Trump then would have a easier path to protect himself from the Russian Investigation. Script? I believe anything nowadays.  However at the end of the day the citizens are the ones suffering. My heart to Florida, 7 Surely this exemplifies exactly why we need SENSIBLE gun control. Human nature dictates that someone will always fall through the cracks. That is why the ONLY way to prevent anyone who wishes to do harm to others will not get an AR15, is the prevent ANYONE from getting an AR15. Period., 7 The FBI also told you that the Russians meddled in the election and that most of Trump's staff was compromised. But we've yet to see a single Republican resign over that particular lapse. , 7 Since when is enforcement and treatment of individuals the sole responsibility of the Federal Government? Florida's Governor should quit himself. He had a far more direct responsibility for this tragic debacle than the FBI Director. , 7 Let us forget the Trump wall and use the $25 Billion to improve school safety and mental health. The $30 million for his parade can also be added. , 7 The FBI says it may have mishandled this one, a rare open admission that honours the obligation entrusted it by the American public. What more needs to be said? Only that there are more serious issues to consider here than a failure of the process to prevent the wrong person from coming into possession of such an arsenal; questions such why, in a civilized country, anyone should ever be able to get their hands on such an arsenal in the first place, let alone a teenager., 7 Of course, no one should be allowed to purchase a military style assault weapon and yes, the FBI stops many attacks we never hear about, but the fact is they didn't stop this one. They are probably overworked and under resourced, like so many American workers in public institutions (teachers, nurses, caseworkers et. al.), 7 I agree with one of the teachers interviewed: If a 19-year-old kid weren't allowed to have the assault rifle in the first place, this tragedy wouldn't have happened, irrespective of what the FBI failed to do., 7 Is anyone really shocked that a country who\u2019s government that can\u2019t contain its own violence is full of citizens who can't do the same? This is core belief issue, not a gun issue. OUR government (federal, state, county, and local) has millions of guns, many of which are AR15s or some variant of the design. Are we shocked that the citizens of our country want to posses and use these guns when our government leaders condone government employees using these same weapons to commit murder? How can we expect a change in how our society behaves when our leaders are the ones pushing for more violence? \n\nMartin Luther King Jr. spoke of violence begetting violence, he was right, just we have failed to realize the violence begets violence in every direction, into the world, into our society, into our culture, and into the minds of our children.\n\nPlease, I beg you, learn and follow the nonaggression principle in your life. Maybe we can have some peace beget some peace., 7 Well, recently I saw a guy on national television say that he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it.  Should the FBI take this seriously and investigate him?, 7 Rick Scott should resign as Governor and not run for the Senate for not supporting legislation to ban the type of weapons used for this travesty.  And Rubio should resign as a Senator and refund the millions of dollars he received from the NRA., 7 Why does the FBI screw up all the time? They screwed up an investigation into the eventual Boston Marathon bombers. They screwed up two reports that Saudi nationals were paying cash to get commercial flying lessons and didn't need to know how to land. They screwed up the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge takeover, infiltrating so many informers that prosecution was compromised; they also shot and killed one of the occupiers and lied about it. In the days of J. Edgar Hoover they used provocateurs at anti-Vietnam War rallies and armed the Black Panthers. They secretly recorded Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his motel rooms. FBI agents in New York leaked information defamatory to Hillary Clinton in the late stages of the 2016 election. What's with the FBI? I support their law enforcement mission, but I have very little faith in their ability to do their job efficiently and effectively. This is just one more screw-up and it cost many innocent lives and doomed many others to lifelong disabilities. Again, what's with the FBI?, 7 Too busy looking for Islamic terrorists., 7 As posted here by some others it is unlikely to have changed anything. This young man bought and assault rifle legally and used it to kill people. If he hadn't been able to do that the consequences might have been different. Simple answer: ban assault weapons of any kind., 7 Blame the director? Oh, why not just blame the head of the Executive branch? Republicans, we know you want to lose Wray and anybody else with any integrity, but you will not succeed. , 7 Joke of the year.  The corrupt governor of Florida - Ric Scott - who made  his money from OUR health care system and now wants to kill as many people as possible by denying them health care coverage - thinks OUR FBI director should quit?\n\nDeflect, deflect, deflect.  Sorry Mr. Scott and your Robber Baron brethren.\nWE THE PEOPLE are on to you and are going to purge you from OUR governments at every level.  My favorite picture of you is on a rail, tarred and feathered, being run to prison.  Can't happen soon enough for me., 7 Some people seem to think the FBI is a stellar law enforcement agency.   It isn't.     And in my mind, never was.  , 7 I blame the United States Congress, especially the republicans who are paid off by the NRA and gun manufacturers. The democrats are equally to blame because of their unbridled support for HIPAA that precludes police and others from looking into the mental background of gun buyers. And the FBI? The Federal Bureau of Ineptitude!  , 7 Heads must roll. Accountability needs to be addressed swiftly and with consequences so all members of our federal, state, and municipality know protecting our students and citizens is the highest priority. Even if the amount of information is overwhelming warnings from private citizens have to be taken seriously and addressed. These wonderful kids should have never been exposed to the hideous agenda of Cruz. If Trump wants to make a difference it should start with \"You're fired\" to the ones who dropped the ball.  , 7 Individuals have been charged with \"terroristic threatening\" for a whole lot less. Usually state chages, and usually a domestic situation, but still.................., 7 The answer to these shootings is multifactorial, and I'm not sure we can get there.  Yes, we need to outlaw automatic weapons BECAUSE then people who are under suspicion and own them can be arrested. We need to fund mental health services fully, BECAUSE then we can perhaps help these shooters.  We need to do background checks BECAUSE it will slow this down. We need to eliminate gun shows BECAUSE it will make it more difficult to buy guns, and there won't be any hidden purchases. We need to remove guns from people convicted of domestic violence BECAUSE too many women are murdered by their partners.  The answer is ALL of this and more. So, when people say \"We can't do that because it won't solve the problem\", we need to say \"Yes, we need to do that AND ...\"  But I question whether this nation can deal with such a complex issue., 7 a good reminder of Molly Ivins' prescient, memorable, and risque quote about the 3 most overrated things., 7 I am a General Surgeon whose been in practice for over 30 years. I live in a smaller urban community in Canada, with lots of hunting enthusiasts.  I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of gunshot wounds I have treated in my career. I am not Solomon, I cannot offer a solution to the problem where more firearms exist in a population than there are people, with the resulting disasters.\nThank God I live in a country with rational gun control., 7 What could the FBI have done? Could they have taken his AR-15 away from him? Required him to seek mandatory mental health counseling or face imprisonment? When the President tells us to \"say something when we see something\" he is telling voters that if we DO say something, something will be done. There is no evidence supporting that. , 7 Sessions has already announced an investigation into the FBI and DOJ handling of the tip, and Trump won't be far behind. The agencies may well have overlooked the information. But even then, they can't detain somebody for what that person \"might\" do. And how many of the people who communicate threats can law enforcement watch (unless, of course, we want a Stasi-like police state where very second person spies on his neighbor).\n\nSo let's place the blame squarely: on laws that allow 18-year-olds to purchase weapons legally (though they can't drink until they're 21), on laws that do no require background checks at gun shows, and on the insanity of not banning assault weapons and strictly limiting the ownership of handguns. Guns DO kill in this country, far too many people every day. The incident in this case simply underlines the tragic and needless epidemic., 7 This represents but a peep into the much larger question of how best to address domestic and maybe even foreign terrorism.  The US has chosen to invest gigantic funds in surveillance of every imaginable flavor... they monitor phones, internet, cameras, etc, etc, etc.  An option would have been, and now could be, to invest about 15% of the funds dedicated to these activities in a massive training roll-out so that they get access to millions of people who could report on potential or observed terrorist activities.  Of course they would have to have a major call center and the wherewithal to respond to these reports.  No one knows for sure that someone would have noticed and/or called  for the many incidents that have happened since 9/11 for instance but it couldn't be much worse than the current system and most likely would be better.  It's not just \"see something, say something\"... it's trained folks in every locality motivated to \"see something, hear something, smell something, notice something and having confidence that when they call, they will get action\"., 7 NY Times reporters, here's your next story: Assuming the FBI had followed through completely, what could they have done based on Florida laws? Arrange a mental health arrest? Confiscate guns? , 7 This is awful.  However, when you have the heckler in chief dogging the FBI, and they in turn leaving in droves what can you expect.  Some incompetent lap dog will be \"put in charge\", make a pig's ear out it, even more people will leave.\n\nIf you don't have enough people to do a job, then it will be half-baked - this is the result of the GOP choosing to let this happen., 7 Oh, swell. Now the disrupter-in-chief can fire Christopher Wray can cleanse the FBI with adequate cover. Then it's off to the DOJ.\nFox News should be on fire today.\nGet the Loyalty Oaths ready, Mr\nPresident, and make sure your appointments submit impressive financial statements worthy of your great club at 1600., 7 \"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US\" deja vu?, 7 The headline should read: \"F.B.I. Was Warned...Desire to Kill...but Suspect Was Unable to Procure Weapon\", 7 No law will stop murder or theft or child abuse or drunk driving -- yet we have laws about them.\n\nTime to make it a law that anyone currently owning or anyone buying an assault weapon ( spare us your \"YOU don't know what an assault weapon IS\" excuse -- guns meant to kill as many as easily as possible in as few seconds as possible are assault weapons), like the one used be required under severe penalty for failure to  do so, i.e. prison, to undergo and pass SWAT-team-style screening, psychological testing, training, and use proficiency and adaption so upgrade to an assault capability be outlawed and possession made an imprisonable offense.\n\nOwners must register the gun under a special license before being allowed to take it home. \n\nMoreover, owners must be required to produce the gun for inspection at 6 month intervals to be sure it has not been stolen, lost or sold illegally. \n\nFinally, certification process ( psych eval, testing, etc. ) must be repeated yearly.\n\nOut of the hands of highly trained and certified persons, they are murder weapons, period. \n\nI do not see what law enforcement could have done sans laws. Certainly, as far the NRA is concerned, nothing should have been done as no restraints should be put on gun-toting?\n\nThose who accept money from the NRA whose life's mission is to put guns in the hands of all who want them: Shut up about the FBI.  \n\nCertainly would not take a gun away from a wholesome Nazi child talking \"white gun nut\" talk about killing people. , 7 Well boyz, you've just provided trump with more ammunition ... so to speak, 7 The FBI was not able to identify the name of the YouTube poster \"nikolas cruz\"? Really?, 7 To scuttle the Russia investigation, watch for Trump to fire Rosenstein over the FBI failure in the Florida massacre., 7 Thanks Trump!, 7 The ugly little truth in the FBI's fumbling is the fact that if the shooter were brown-skinned, named Mohammad and had a full bread, they would've acted sooner. \n\nAnd our President would've labeled him a terrorist. \n\nGod bless America., 7 This problem begins and ends with guns. \n\nIt's the guns, stupid., 7 Do background checks consider school activity?  Perhaps the killer wouldn't have been able to pass one had they looked into his school expulsion., 7 There is only one question that matters:  How did he get those guns?  Answer the question, then figure out how to prevent him from getting them.  , 7 Can't wait for \"Minority Report\" to become a reality! Just think of all the \"crimes\" that will be stopped by a quick peek into the future. Until then America can only hope that its citizen's rights will be overturned in the interest of public safety. , 7 Maybe the FBI is responsible for too many things.  Leave them exclusively to investigating Trump and set up a new agency strictly for school shooters.  Sort of like Resource Specialists only with a badge and a gun., 7 Let me see if get this right . . . . not one but 2 reports to the FBI. The boy was expelled from school for disciplinary reasons (allegedly, bullets were found in his back-pack) and, according to an earlier article in the NYT, the police were at his house numerous times. Sadly no amount of finger pointing can undo this horrible tragedy. \n\nThe fact of the matter is this. If law enforcement spent more time preventing crime rather than showing up after the crime has been committed - we would live in much safer society. \n\nCommunity policing is just one of many solutions. Instilling deterrents, fear, oversight.  Where each officer is assigned to a specific area of their town. Where they walk a beat rather than sit in their cars playing on phones or schmoozing with each other.\n\nWhere they familiarize themselves with all the residents, shop and business owners, school children, dog walkers., etc. Where they get out and talk to residents. Where they know where the problematic people and situations exist. \n\nPeople do what they do because they can. It's as plain and simple as that! Until the system changes and law enforcement starts actually enforcing laws none of these situations will ever change. Bernie Madoff, Wall St, did what they did because they could! The irony being, overnight they've practically  eradicated sexual harassment in the workplace!  \n\nThese kids need to stand up and start a movement refusing to vote and watch how fast Washington reacts.    , 7 This article is just meant to inflame.  It is pointless.  We can't place all the blame on our police for a society that is unwilling to assist with its troubled citizens., 7 \"If you see something, say something\" does not work if saying something results in nothing.  The government did not hold up its end of the bargain this time.  Ironic, given the President's comments suggesting that many knew about Cruz's mental state, suggesting the onus was on the public to solve gun violence by turning in people before they commit gun violence.  Here they actually did, and the FBI that Trump has been bashing continuously was apparently too busy or distracted by other priorities to properly channel the tip to the Miami Field Office.   It is too hard to keep guns away from mentally ill people -- history has proven that point in blood.  We must keep weapons of war away from all civilians -- sane or not., 7 Let me be clear, this is my public tip to the FBI to continue investigation into fellow citizen Trump who threatens and condones violence on fellow citizens, fails to protect children from gun violence, threatens to deny Dreamers a future in their home country, disrespects rights and freedoms of women, displays erratic behaviors and posts disturbing social media posts. When you see something, say something., 7 I really don't think they could have prevented the shooting. He already had the gun., 7 But what do you do when no crime has been committed? You can't send him to a mental institution for more than a couple of days. You can't watch him 24/7.\nNice to know that someone is watching him, but this is a distraction. No one under 21 should be able to buy a gun. No one with diagnosed mental illness should be able to buy or receive a gun. No gun with more than three bullets in it should ever be available to anyone unless he or she is serving in the military. The NRA and Republicans in Congress are to blame for this as much as Mr. Cruz., 7 Even if mental health care could have prevented this, how would an essentially homeless youth working at a minimum wage job find mental health care in a state that did not see fit to expand Medicaid?, 7 we need to begin \"single issue\" voter groups, modeled after \"mothers against drunk driving\":  pledge to vote against any candidate, of any party, at any level of government, who supports n.r.a. leadership.  moreover, pledge to support financially, to the extent possible, opponents of the n.r.a. supporters.\n\nmost people, including n.r.a. members, support responsible gun legislation that the n.r.a. leadership, serving the interests of the gun-makers, oppose.  \n\nand, as for the press, make sure you ask every candidate for every office what he/she thinks about additional gun regulation--and don't allow the candidate to give you the mealy-mouthed excuse that \"it's not the time to talk about this\".  it's always the time to talk about this., 7 The FBI's lack of action is a fallout of a nation overly PC and too concerned with any scent of a civil rights violation or \"harassment\", to the point where we are hesitant and even fearful of saying anything critical to anyone in public no matter how wrong their behavior for fear of a lawsuit or even criminal charges. Thus, we get preventable situations like this one perhaps due to a running-scared government agency that is sworn to enforce and uphold the law and does not do so., 7 Even so, there was little they could have done to prevent this, short of moving in with the guy. The hands of law enforcement are tied until some commits an actual crime. We can't arrest and hold people on suspicion alone. This is going to be the excuse that the Trump administration and his base of deplorables latches onto. Anything to keep their hands on their precious guns, even at the expense of our children., 7 As a former Special Forces Green Beret, the use of the 2nd Amendment to proliferate combat weapons into the mass market confounds me.  \n\n\"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nHere is the answer to this problem.  If you want to purchase an assault weapon, great, it comes with a membership in a state militia or National Guard and your weapon gets locked in an arms room except during mandatory training or when needed for \"the security of a free state.\" \n\nThis could also help solve another embarrassing social problem in the US, the lack of participation of 99% of the nation in sharing the burden of national defense.  You want an assault weapon and to play soldier, enlist.  , 7 A multi-level tragedy, but I find it hard to blame the FBI...\nThe agency was, perhaps, distracted by constant attacks and by politicized leadership, as stumpy put, and continues to put, saving himself over the interests of the nation., 7 First order of business;  BAN the sale of AR-15 to the general public, PERIOD.  This piece is for killing multiple people in minutes belongs on a battle field not in the homes of this countries citizens.\nAn 18 year old can buy a weapon as this without intense vetting, but has to show proof of age to buy a beer.\nAfter this tragic incident Speaker of the House Ryan stated at a news conference, \"this was not the proper time to discuss this tragedy\".  What would Ryan's response be had a tragedy of this nature happened to him?   My money on Ryan, is that it will not be a number one topic to discuss.\nTo defer the topic, the discussion will steer toward the FBI's failure to track down the young man and not his easy access to this weapon and why do we continue to manufacture this killing machine for public use.  , 7 This oversight by the FBI is yet more proof that trying to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill, and making our schools \"safer\", are not enough to slow this decline into barbarity.\nThe supply of armaments is what must be curtailed., 7 Much will be made of this in a concerted effort to shift focus from the legal sale of assault weapons to civilians by those who want us to think the problem can be solved by looking for a needle in a haystack. , 7 I wonder how many tips the FBI gets a day on potential shooters? The problem is not the FBI. The problem is the cultural concept that everything can be fixed with a gun or violence. For once (alright more than once), I'd like to see a headline touting compassion and caring are spiraling out of control., 7 Let's stop reporting stories trying to figure out a motive, trying to blame some agency who missed a tip, or beefing up our mental health services. Instead of trying to to find and treat the needle in the gun haystack, remove the haystack of guns in this society---it is that simple.  , 7 Let us not forget that it is the presence of guns in our society that is responsible for gun violence.  Getting side-tracked into assessing blame in the occasional event only detracts from the important goal of getting weapons of war off our streets., 7 Gun Control\n\nEstimated Guns per 100 Residents\n\nUnited States\t101\n\nNorway           31\n\nCanada           31\n\nDenmark          12\n\nThe first rule I leaned is that you never issue an order that you can not enforce.\n\nOutlawing guns in a country containing 330 million guns is an order that can not be enforced.\n\nJust as outlawing liquor did not make it disappear.outlawing guns will not make guns disappear.  It just will drive the sale undergrouns.\n\nAnd as in the prohibition,  lead to more  crime to control the trade.  \n\nWhat can be accomplished, is outlawing sale of ammunition.   As the current ammo supply is being used up, prices will skyrocket on the black market pricing them out of reach for most.   Smuggling ammo into the US is difficult as metals can be easily and cheaply detected . \n\nI.e. concentrate on turning of the supply lines to what comes out of a  gun., 7 I've seen a lot of comments here that seem to diminish the significance of the lapse by the FBI, pointing to the fact that the shooter shouldn't have had access to the weapon, or that he hadn't done anything illegal. While these are indeed true, it doesn't mean that the FBI was powerless.\n\nWhen a Good Samaritan tips off the FBI that he/she believes someone poses a threat because of their \"\u201cdesire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts,\u201d there is a protocol, and the FBI admits that it wasn't followed.\n\nI believe that in this case, proper FBI follow-ups at the local level, in coordination with local law enforcement, could have changed the outcome here., 7 Something has happened to the FBI - it is not the institutions it once were.  It appear to continually be plagued with bureaucratic snafus.  It is very unsettling to me, as a citizen, as I was brought up to believe the FBI was the \"highest of the high\" where law enforcement and crime prevention was concerned.\n\nYes, I DO believe that a visit from the FBI to this young man, might well have made a difference.  \n\nYes, the easy availability of guns by people who shouldn't be entrusted with a homemade slingshot, is a very big part of this problem - they can kill far more people in a very short time.  But figuring out who might become such a school shooter should also be a  priority, and I don't see anyone starting a lobbying group against this.\n\nWe must use every single means at our disposal to put this to an end., 7 Law enforcement is one of the few things the government actually should do. It's sad that it's doing so much other stuff that it shouldn't do that it doesn't have time for this., 7 Seconding some other comments, the FBI has come up front to say that it did\u2019t handle the warning as well as it should have. In this administration, it doesn\u2019t seem that there are very many agencies and appointed officials left with the integrity to say that., 7 And what is this administration doing to ensure adequate staffing at all F.B.I. Field offices so these tips can be adequately followed up on?\nWhat is this administration doing to make sure the F.B.I. gets and retains the best people?  The constant bashing by Trump of the F.B.I. does nothing for morale and people that are constantly under attack in their jobs can get beaten down and people who are constantly defending themselves & their jobs may be distracted from their duties.\nNo excuses are being made, but the administration has to do a better job of supporting the very agencies responsible for our protection., 7 Unlike the critics of the FBI, they have owned up to their mistake and will make changes.  Very refreshing in a government that is constantly trying to side step responsibility., 7 I cannot imagine what the FBI could have done before the fact.\nThe bottom line is that this individual should not have been able to legally purchase an assault weapon. No civilian should be allowed to purchase an assault weapon. , 7 Seems to me that there needs to be a way to not only tell the FBI about people exhibiting concerning signs, but also to have programs in place to assess mental health and begin the arduous process of therapeutic services for those who are at risk. Yes, an 18 year old should not be able to buy an AR-15. So I'm not trying to make this mental health vs. gun control -- we need both. But the sad fact is that we don't have a mental health program clearly in place to go through the process of identification of those at risk, referral to services, and payment for services., 7 Yes, the FBI should have acted on the tip.  Yes, adults should have noticed the student's behavior.  Yes, there are a lot of things that should have happened but didnt.  While it is going to be human nature and easy to blame the FBI for this shooting, it is not the fault of the FBI.  The FBI did not put the gun in the hands of the shooter or give him the motivation to commit this atrocity.  What we as a society need to focus on is prevention for the future.  Do we as a society really want to shrug a shoulders each time one of these shootings happens (and they are happening far too often)?  The issue of guns needs to be addressed.  We can try to watch for signs of trouble, but this shooting and others wouldnt happen if guns werent so freely available and prevalent.  , 7 With the state of gun laws, especially in Florida, even if the FBI had followed up on Cruz and ascertained that he possibly posed a threat, it's unlikely that they could have taken away his access to guns.  Trump, the NRA and the Florida legislature have put a tight rein on any efforts to violate gun owners' right to shoot innocent people., 7 The FBI failed to \"connect the dots\" on the events leading up to the attacks of 9/11\"\n\nIn this case, it appears that the FBI couldn't even find the \"dots,\" much less connect them.\n\nPer the article: \"The information should have been assessed and forwarded to the Miami F.B.I. field office, the agency said.\"\n\nFumbling, Bumbling, Incompetent, 7 Your tax dollars at work., 7 This will surely help to fuel Republican criticism of FBI ineptitude. And it should. , 7 It is fairly revolting to see Trumpists trying to use this screwup and the deaths of 17 people to try and help get their boy off the hook. \n\nAnd yes, if the FBI had followed up, they COULD have got this guy hauled into court, taken his guns, and stopped this., 7 He bought his AR-15 legally and likely everybody that's ever bought one of those weapons has a \"desire to kill.\" It was the right thing to do alerting the FBI about this killer. Too bad these weapons are owned by so many people like him that law enforcement will never have the chance to run surveillance on them all. , 7 Perhaps if the FBI didn't have to spend the month arguing with the House and the White House about that silly Nunes memo.  Maybe if they weren't all demoralized by the president.  Maybe if we could allow the Bureau to operate outside politics, they would be better able to focus on their work., 7 This looks bad in hindsight, to be sure. Of course, they would not have had probable cause to arrest him but maybe an intervention with a parent or guardian might have resulted in taking the weapons from him. Still a long shot because sociopaths are pretty hard to deter. And this kid has some serious wiring issues. , 7 Can I please have my taxes refunded.  I am not getting the service I had hoped for., 7 The kids screen name was his exact name,  same spelling and all.  I find it implausible or simply false that the FBI of all organizations could not determine who sent the post especially considering that this young man was apparently already in their crosshairs.  The collusion case is a real page turner.  Lets keep our children.safe first so they live to be old enough to vote then we can address the Russians once Trump has expired. , 7 Good thing Trump has the FBI focusing on Radical Islamic Terrorists.  It's made us all much safer. And it's great that Trump is continually distracting the FBI  and FBI leadership from doing their jobs with self-serving tweets attacking the agency because, again, it makes us all much safer. Can't wait to hear how the FBI's failure a year into Trump's presidency is Obama's fault. But, hey, the airlines didn't crash any planes in Trump's first year in office only because he told them not to and he's just that great a leader when it comes to keeping us all much safer., 7 The FBI is a back-end response to a front-end problem.  That never works., 7 Regardless of anyone says, the FBI is clearly broken.  Whitewashing about protocols?  How about the human decency that apparently is lost on so many.  Sad!, 7 This lack of oversight by the FBI demonstrates that institutions in this great country of ours are completely useless just like its president and his administration. God help us., 7 Will Trump be paying his legal fees, as he promised? , 7 Well, on to the next school shooting.  This will play right into the Republican narrative about a corrupt and feckless FBI. \n\nThe US is the most dangerous place in the developed world for teenagers to grow up.  Kids can buy AR15s before they can legally buy a beer.   What a world we\u2019re leaving for these kids.   , 7 To busy giving political opinions. Heads must roll or the people will loose faith in them., 7 Although a devastating mistake on the part of the FBI, this young man should never have been allowed to purchase a gun.  A 19-yo boy can buy a lethal weapon like the AK15 in this country?  THAT is the ultimate irony and INSANITY HERE.   First things first:  Gun control.  , 7 The FBI should not be used as a scapegoat for this tragedy but I will wager they will be blamed by certain persons on the \"right.\", 7 We live in a land ruled by white men who love guns, and where white male mass murderers with guns terrorize our children and communities. We also live in a land of taxation without representation. The majority of Americans do not want white male mass murders out there with all the guns they wish to have. The majority of Americans are not represented by a congress that loves guns and the NRA and hates American children and US taxpayers., 7 The FBI was too busy chasing the fake Russian collusion scandal. Heads must roll. What did Comey know and when did he know it?, 7 A parenthetical question: why is the term \u201cschool shooter\u201d being used? It\u2019s accurate, but it fails to covey the disturbing, horrific nature what a school shooter does. How about \u201cthe mass murderer\u201d  or \u201cthe psychotic killer of children?\u201d The use of accurate, fully descriptive terminology is one area where the media can make a meaningful contribution (as it has already done by naming these child-killers as infrequently as possible)., 7 What would law enforcement have done? Look back at the facts of the Columbine tragedy. Police did interview Kleibold and Harris after they posted material indicating their intent to kill. What other steps? Originally, their intent was to blow victims up. We can talk about gun control until we are blue in the face...we are already there. How come an 18 year old cant buy cigarettes but can buy an AR 15??? When can we focus on the pre-20 year old white male and the anger/social psychopathic behaviors? Or better security at schools? Isn't it worth it to pay for metal detectors and security? Sad that we are at this point? It is more than one thing. God help the families., 7 Maybe the FBI was too busy monitoring, infiltrating, spying, harassing and entrapping US \"eco-terrosits\", which FBI has defined as a high priority domestic terror risk, higher than right wing militia groups., 7 You have a President who had made multiple violent threats. Has at his disposal a huge arsenal of weapons. He has made his intentions very clear. Will the FBI investigate?, 7 If the FBI had stepped in and \"done something\" before the shooting, the NRA would have called it harassment, government overreach, and infringement of his second amendment rights.  There was no way to win on this one.  , 7 While I enthusiastically support various forms of significant gun control, I just wish Times commenters showed equivalent outrage about drunk, drugged, and texting drivers who kill more people each year. , 7 This, on top of guns, guns and more guns. When will it stop? Must someone kill hundreds? That is possible., 7 Let's not let this take away from the fact that the NRA is complicit in this horrific tragedy., 7 Stop playing into Trump's hand.   The FBI is not the problem.  It's the world created by the NRA who think everyone should own a machine gun.   Anyone who thinks they need an AR-15 for \"protection\" is mentally disturbed. Unfortunately that includes most republicans.  , 7 Good old Americans.  You're always looking for a way to be able to say, \"See, this only happened because of some fluke\", thereby keeping alive the myth that it can be fixed.  It CAN be fixed, as is obvious from the fact that it doesn't happen anywhere else, but YOU will never be able to fix it because you refuse to adopt the only real solution., 7 Yes, the FBI missed the tip, but that does not alter the fact that an angry, young man was able to walk into a gun shop and legally purchase an assault rifle. All over the world, people make threats similar to those by Nikolas Cruz. Only in America is it possible to act on those threats so easily., 7 And if the FBI had acted on that tip in January, what could it have done? Could it have mandated that Cruz be committed to a psychiatric facility? Isn't that against the law? I believe that the only answer to all this horror is to first, vote out the legislators who are the pawns of the NRA; second, once we have responsible, intelligent human beings in the Congress and Senate, pass stringent gun control laws. My personal wish is that we could do as Australia has done. Nobody has ever been able to accuse Aussies of being spineless namby-pambies, but those tough people realized the cost of uncontrolled gun ownership and acted accordingly. Result: very few gun deaths, and nothing like the mass shootings we witness here in the States every week., 7 If you\u2019re born with a constitutional right to own an AR-15, as They say, then you\u2019d have to do something pretty terrible to have that right taken away. Even according to the NRA, a school mass shooting would probably qualify, so from now on he can\u2019t get another one., 7 Yet more confirmation that the government is incapable of operating any enterprise competently.\n\nSee Amtrak, VA Health Care, healthcare dot gov, the Post Office, Military Spending, Air Traffic Control, Public Housing, Inner City Schools, DC Metro System, NYC Subways, and on and on., 7 It's actually quite simple.  Any person who wants a weapon whose only purpose is to main and kill other people must be mentally ill, and so should not be allowed to obtain one., 7 \"field office looked into the comment but could not identify who had posted it from database and open-source searches\"\n\nPretty lame. The correct way is to contact YouTube and ask for the IP address of the comment poster. And the e-mail address used to register with YouTube., 7 Whatever happened to \"If you see something, say something.\"?  Several people \"said something\" and it didn't matter at all.  If the F.B.I. doesn't take threats seriously, then what can ordinary citizens do?, 7 What is the protocol? He acquired the gun legally. Did he break some other law? Should they have shipped him to Guantanamo? \n\nThe problem is that he wanted to murder people and had easy access to an extremely efficient murder tool., 7 The FBI knew who Nick Cruz was he was on YouTube saying he wanted to be the first professional school shooter he was turned into the FBI. Think the FBI made contact armed him set things in motion? How many time has the FBI got some handicapped child and gave him a fake bomb tell him we are going to blow up a bridge? The handicap kids goes along he pushes the button on the fake bomb because he does not have the capacity to understand what he is doing is wrong.  The FBI moves in and say we caught a home grown terrorist?  Is that we are seeing here today? , 7 People screw up; a thorough investigation will reveal who it was.  Can you imagine the guilt that person will live with forever?, 7 Oh no! This is disastrous! What reasons can there be about why this was not followed up?\nAnd an alert to us all: When we do give a tip of this kind, I we will have to take it on ourselves to see that it is followed up. Demand to know what action is taken when we offer a tip like this in the future. The person who gave the tip trusted the FBI to do the right thing. . . well, we all now know what we have to do in the future. Holler louder! After we take the guns away from people who are too young to drink! , 7 \"Agents from the F.B.I. Jackson, Miss., field office looked into the comment but could not identify who had posted it from database and open-source searches, the F.B.I. said.\" The post that was cited was in the name \"Nikolas Cruz\". How could the FBI not identify who posted it?, 7 And so it goes. Trump will now fire the head of the FBI, replace him with a gestapo/KGB type and we can definitely kiss what's left of our greatly diminished and weakened democratic republic goodbye. , 7 Why in the world would this be the fault of the FBI and/or law enforcement?  \n\nFriends and family said they knew this young man had a problem.  They read his social media posts.  There is no blame to be placed on \"society\" or law enforcement at any level.\n\nGUNS ARE THE PROBLEM.  GET THEM OFF THE STREETS OF AMERICA.\n\nEVERY GUN in OUR United States of America must be REGISTERED on a national database, state LICENSED and fully INSURED for liability.\n\nAttention gun owners:  WE THE PEOPLE do not want your guns.  WE want your guns to stop killing us and our loved ones.  Don't you?, 7 This is terrible news and, if possible, makes the killing of these children all the more senseless because this crime was perhaps preventable.\n\nBut I acknowledge the integrity and honesty of the FBI for making this information public., 7 One can't help but get the sense that America is a country in crisis at the moment. Trump in the Oval Office, the GOP controlling both houses, no universal healthcare, rampant school and other shootings, enormous income inequality, an unjust justice system, inaction on climate change...\n\nWhat happened to America being a leader in the World? , 7 And the US Congress, the Florida Legislature, and our NRA-bankrolled political leaders have failed to act *for many years* on the mass murders at Columbine, Sandy Hook, Orlando, Las Vegas. . . ., 7 The FBI is too distracted investigating its own leaders and POTUS to do its own job. What a mess!, 7 This once great crime fighting agency has fallen on hard times. But painting them with a broad brush of incompetence based on this case and the fiasco that is the investigation of any Trump role in Russian meddling during the presidential campaign would be doing them a disservice. However, we have discovered that impartiality and thorough follow-up on leads are traits that the F.B.I. needs to work on immediately. , 7 Trump isn't the reason the American people are losing confidence in the FBI. The FBI is the reason the American people are losing confidence in the FBI. It's not about training or resources, it's about laziness and incompetence. The FBI seems more intent in keeping their jobs than doing their jobs. , 7 Why even publish this?  This is exactly what the gun lobby wants: a scapegoat.  Our gun \"laws\" failed.  That's it., 7 Perhaps this would be a reason to clear out the top ranks of the FBI to put in place the kind of people Mr. Trump would prefer to have? Does anyone know how many other dangerous nutbars the FBI was trying to get a handle on at the same time?, 7 It is truly tragic that this was missed but had the FBI followed up, could they have prevented this?  The shooter bought his gun legally and even though there were several \"red flags\" it seems that he had violated no laws and current Federal law does not allow denying guns to people who are mentally ill.\n\nI really hope that Trump does not use this incident to deflect from the need for gun control or, cynically, to use as ammunition in his claim that the FBI is \"broken.\", 7 If the young man hadn't committed any crime until he did, what could police have done?  Questioned him?  \"Kept an eye on him?\"  Everything he did, prior to his murder spree, was legal.  Want to buy an AR-15?  Cool!  Want to train with white supremacist paramilitary groups? Great!  This is the land of the free, after all., 7 There are no words. We will be watching for actions., 7 We cannot reasonably expect (except with 20/20 hindsight) for the FBI to be able to investigate every single piece of information they receive.  The Bureau has under 14,000 actual agents (by comparison the New York City Police Department has over 34,000 officers).\n\nHowever, the FBI should have immediately shared this information with state and local law enforcement authorities., 7 As awful as this lapse is, it does not and should not change the larger issue of the inadequate gun control we have in this country., 7 We have a government that refuses all pushes for reform.\n\nWe have a government that refuses to enforce current law.\n\nWe have a government that does not care if citizen children are murdered.\n\nWhy should I expect the FBI to follow up?  It is very likely none of the agents had students in this school.   Not their kid so why care?\n\nThis society is terrible.  All the responsible gun owners are terrible.  , 7 Parenthetical to the sad and terrible things about this is how it will certainly be used as political fodder by the anti-Mueller forces in the White House., 7 The FBI needs to start doing their job, instead of interfering in Presidential elections., 7 What would they have been able to do about it? What legislation would have allowed them to hold him, track his every move, or take his guns away?, 7 I guess they were too busy with politics., 7 The news about the FBI is alarming, but DO NOT let it dominate the current discussion. This is about guns, not some bureaucratic snafu, however costly., 8 Suggestion\nThis President Day students should hold mass rallies asking our President\nto talk about guns & violence & begin in acting laws to forbid guns to be\nbought by people with mental illness & oulawing weapons that are for\nwar\nPrayers will not be helpful unless we listen to our prayers & take action\nGod can\u2019t help people can , 8 It is quite obvious that the Republican Party does not care about the gun violence in the US and that their candidates and donors profit from it..  They are not going to help stamp out this scourge. They are parasites, not helpers.\n With 30,000 gun deaths a year and over twice as many wounded, there are 100,000 US citizens affected every year or 3 million affected in the past 30 years.\n\nIf each of those souls knows 10 people, there are 30 million touched by gun violence.  It is time to mobilize these people in order to vote the godless Republicans out of office.\n\nVote the Republican bums out of office in 2018.  Stop killing your own children.  Don't get mad get even.  The only way to reverse course is to  get rid of the vile politicians who are voting to kill your fellow citizens.\n\nOrganize, educate, register voters, vote in 2018., 8 Perhaps NRA stands for Not Really American., 8 New York Times - if you're listening - assign your best reporters to do an expose of the NRA. They are fraudulent. The MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi, who is a gun owner, said that they send him membership cards every year, stating he is a member although he's never signed up for membership or ever indicated he wanted to be a member of their organization. It seems like they inflate their member rolls and make it appear that they've got huge a large segment of the American populace behind them, people who love the second ammendment more than tthey love God, from the sound of it, but it may all be a big hoax. Maybe they just get access to gun owners names through data bases, send them a letter claiming that that person is now a proud member of the NRA and then sell politicians on these false numbers. As they stuff the pol's coffers with $$, they show these inflated numbers of NRA supporters. We have a fradulent President, and we probably have a huge hoax in the NRA too. Their actual number of members and support is likely much smaller than what they claim. Expose the bums. , 8 Mr. Wayne LaPierre, your rebuttal?, 8 This what happens when our Left-Wing Media sensationalizes and belabors each and every occurance, ad nauseam; crazed, mentally deficients, finally get the message and join in!, 8 American Carnage. Trump should give that speech again, this time begging forgiveness for his impotency and cowardly failure to stop children and everybody else from  being killed by insane gun violence., 8 I saw a post the other day that encapsulated the gun problem in our country and the hypocrisy of the congressional cowards paid off by the NRA. \"Amazing how mental illness doesn't massacre school children in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom.\" As far as I'm concerned, the NRA should be banned as a subversive organization since it has been infiltrated by Russian agents and funneled Russian money to Trump's presidengial campaign., 8 school shooting victims are cannon fodder for gun company profits, 8 Mr, Gibson,\nThank you for your heart rending editorial. I frankly think you should snarl. If I were in your shoes, I'd snarl. I'd be inclined to tear the heart out of any politician I could lay my hands on who dared talk about mental illness or said, it wasn't time to talk about guns. I'd pummel stupid media people for their vampirish need to suck even more blood from the collective victims of this insanity, only to move off topic when there's something new to titillate Americans. The surviving children in Florida have it right. Politicians at the federal and state level will do nothing so long as shake our heads and move on, so they yell, they curse, and they cry - as they should.  And unless the rest of us join in the cacophony we share the blame., 8 It was students that stopped our role in Vietnam.\nIt was students that protested against racial bigotry.\nIt was students that galvanized efforts against apartheid in South Africa.\nIt is now up to students to take on the NRA and the politicians suck off their money tit. High school and College students,  AND THEIR TEACHERS need to make a statement, need to lead the rest of America in this struggle against insane political interests.  NO MORE GUNS., 8 \"If we wanted it to stop, Himes said, we\u2019d do something about it.\"\n****************\nAnd Florida was/is/will be until the next time (and there will be a next time)the answer to that statement., 8 Start publishing the photos.  While projecting news footage of live battles into our living rooms at dinner time may not have been the only factor in ending the war in Vietnam or photos the only factor in bringing lynching to an end (well, almost) they were damn powerful.  Nothing would be more powerful in bringing people into the streets or forcing members of congress to face what their inaction is doing to us everyday.  , 8 Republicans have a lot to lose by opposing sensible gun safety laws. At the rate the country is going, over half of the country will have lost someone close by senseless killing. Once the recalcitrants are out of power they will have nothing to about anything.\n\nI agree nothing will eliminate all killing, but evidence shows good laws reduce deaths. It bothers me what lack of laws to protect our citizens says about us as a nation., 8 The reason is simple. Not enough Americans who vote have put their votes where their mouths are. Listening to politicians babble on with their meaningless rhetoric telling their constituents they're doing their best in trying to solve problems while year after year they do nothing should have consequences. Want to make gun laws more stringent? Then make that your one issue you will not negotiate over. If your Representative has an \"A\" rating from the N.R.A. then he or she is part of the problem. No matter the lies they tell you you can be sure they will do nothing about gun violence. Nothing. And so it is incumbent upon you the voter to threaten removal from their cushy jobs should they not act. The N.R.A. has conveniently used their ratings of politicians as an endorsement. By hoisting these same politicians on their own petard by using that rating to remove said politician from office. If voters stick to their guns, the guns contained in the voting booth, and fire these do-nothing nincompoops from Congress you can be sure future candidates who want to do something about this American Carnage will speak up. The voters must encourage anti- N.R.A. people to run for office. Just like the Me Too movement, the Never Again movement against mass murder can finally get something done. \n\nDD\nManhattan, 8 If millions of Americans pour into the streets across the nation vigorously demanding changes in current gun laws, MAYBE politicians will do something. Activism among teenagers may FINALLY raise fear amongst politicians that they will get kicked out of office if they continue to kowtow to the NRA after raking in their contributions.\n\nENOUGH IS ENOUGH! More power to you, kids! , 8 The NRA has tapped into an awful combination of selfishness and paranoia to get people to resist common sense gun laws.  Couple that with the NRA's willingness and ability to spend millions of dollars, the cowardice and complicity of today's politicians, especially Republicans, and we do indeed have a country that doesn't want the killings to stop., 8 Sir, each and every word in this article has the force of a steel tipped whiplash.  I fervently hope  these words tear through the \" complacent hide\" of the blind protectors  of the second amendment. Fate has willed that you carry on this struggle against easy access to guns while grieving in perpetuity.  You are not  a mere survivor, it is humanity that survives in you and others as unfortunate. , 8 We did not have this in the Southern California of my youth, 1960's.   Just a few years ago it came to Santa Barbara,  the shooting of students at Isla Vista.   When I was 18 or so my boss in LA tried to say this kind of thing just \"happens\" citing the recent events at UT Austin where somebody picked off kids.  I want to argue:  This is in LARGE PART cultural, having to do with the NRA and the glamorization and paranoia of gun culture.  And it has, yes always been around in some regions.  Now in Boston, now in Santa Barbara.  I don't want to live in the \"Dukes of Hazard\" comic book.  It was not real.  This is., 8 I don't think anything will change until someone manages to get an AR-15 or similar into the House or Senate chambers, or an NRA convention, and blows out a few dozen of those useless brains. Because those people don't understand ANYTHING except what affects them directly. \n\nThis is a horrible thing to say, yes. I'm not advocating it and personally I don't want to even touch a gun, let alone own one. But I have so given up on the prospect for healthy change on this issue that I believe it to be true, if only as a \"thought experiment.\", 8 Thank you Mr Gibson for sharing your awful and lifelong pain with us. Even here in little Norway, we have not been able to escape one atrocity; but gun crime here is extremely rare. However, and with respect, I fear your observations on \"The cowardice and cynicism of politicians,\"  may err on the side of moderation.\n\nTrump and the GOP have put automatic guns in the hands of hundreds of thousands of people, knowing full well that some are bound to be deranged killers and that some of these are also bound to slip through any conceivable safety net. That makes these politicians accessories to murder. No less.\n\nAccording to Washington Post, the FBI\u2019s call center in 2017 received more than 766,000 calls, (from people with concerns about unstable gun owners). Common sense dictates that no system can guarantee against errors of judgement when assessing 3/4 million messages.\n\nConsider then the vile dishonesty and hypocrisy and, yes, wickedness of Trump and his GOP  enablers who, accept NRA bribes (so-called donations) in exchange for putting military grade weapons in the hands of countless Americans, and then immediately blame the law enforcement authorities when some crazy killer predictably, slips through the net. This is not just \"cowardice and cynicism\". It is criminal collusion in willful child murder on a grand scale., 8 Eloquent and poignant. So much to say, so little progress achieved.  I am saddened and outraged.\n\nHere's one angle: the Roberts court is complicit in so much bad law that frustrates democracy in this benighted land. Citizens United.  Heller.  Bush v. Gore.  And now McDonnell.  When I think of Mr. Justice Roberts, I imagine, beneath the mildly smiling exterior and the black robe, a demon's tail and cloven hoofs.\n\nIf politicians didn't spend up to six hours a day dialing for dollars, if their campaigns were publicly funded rather than being the legalized bribery authorized by the SCOTUS, maybe some sense might be allowed to prevail, but we are in the process of reversing the American Revolution and instituting a blended oligarchy-aristocracy.  It might be funny if the results weren't tragic., 8 Nothing will come of the anger and Never Again, regardless of how impassioned and direct are the demands of one after another tragically and undeniably changed teenager, because nothing politically has changed to sustain beyond the moment the motivation to participate and to vote democratically.\n\nThis actually is a right AND left or red and blue issue that can be decisively and humanely grasped despite Congress, meaning ALL Congressmen, perversely distorting and killing any demands as surrendering to others individuals\u2019 rights. This shameful national tragedy has never been about freedom but about a siege mentality prevailing over public or community safety and well-being.\n\nThere are very definable even vocally disgruntled segments of the religious right and among evangelicals with whom the LGBTQ leadership can form a formidable challenge to the NRA\u2019s control over Congress.\n\nBoth evangelical and LGBTQ leadership are missing a momentous and self-effacing opportunity to extend hands, even to proactively embrace the best interests and instincts of all Americans, and to curb if not end the insanity around gun rights and gun ownership., 8 For the first time in our 30-year marriage, my wife raised the idea of us moving overseas, just to distance ourselves from this routine murderous violence. We do have that option but I doubt we\u2019ll actually do it. Instead we\u2019ll have to bear the fact this is part and parcel of our society and is an issue that reaches far beyond whether or not we ban assault rifles. Mr. Gibson\u2019s piece is profoundly moving. If he and other parents of victims, especially young children, can bear to show those awful photographic images of the brutal effects of gun violence on their loved ones, I hope they will go ahead and do so. Otherwise, unless the horror of this issue is really in our faces, I\u2019m not optimistic that any meaningful change will happen. A couple of years ago, journalist Dan Hodges tweeted: \u201cIn retrospect Sandy Hook marked the end of the US gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over.\u201d The worst thing that I can imagine is that he is right., 8 A beautifully written article full of anger and reason and compassion. And in the end it's Mr. Himes who is still right about all of this. If we wanted it to stop we would do something about it. But we---we as a country---don't. We have decided at the ballot box (the polls don't matter; tv interviews don't matter, outrage in the newspaper doesn't matter; sadly, even the child victims raising their voices don't matter) that it is more important to us to have free access to whatever guns we desire than it is to stop our children being slaughtered. Until that changes, until Americans care enough about dead children to vote out the enablers in Congress, nothing changes., 8 If the NRA's assertion that guns don't kill people was true, then they ought to be willing to agree to a 1 year scientific experiment whereby automatics, semi-automatics and bump-stops would be banned. If mass-shooting statistics in the USA didn't fall the the NRA would have an argument. But would they agree to such an experiment? Don't hold your breath., 8 Hello from a new member of the club. \n\nMy brother-in-law bought a gun in Los Angeles in early December, underwent the 10-day waiting period. hand-wrote a full confession that he was going to murder his wife, and then on December 28 shot my unsuspecting sister in the head while she sat at her computer. He then swallowed a bunch of pills in a botched suicide attempt.\n\nToday, he's in the L.A. County jail facing a first-degree murder charge with $3 million bail. (California law required his bail be raised by $1 million because a gun was used in the crime.)\n\nThis man had many options to get out of an unhappy domestic life, but he chose the easiest: buy a gun and pull the trigger. , 8 Two main points.   I totally agree with the author ... \n\nAs a European born and raised.   And having lived in 3 different countries in local households (Spain, Germany, and France) it is my opinion that the level of apathy in the US exceeds -way by far---anything I have experienced in any of these 3 countries        And I have seen here over the years many examples of this attitude\u2014in my social life, in my work life, in my student life.     Like another NYT reader said in another comment \u2013 \u201cthe complacency in this country is appalling.\u201d\nAnd Like the author very pointedly says \u201cthe misplaced pity of the American public, their self-absorbed refusal to put their clickers down\u2026\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd the second point... based on my personal experience--my own life and what I have seen in the rearing of children of my close friends.   The rearing of children is paramount to their psychological and social and civic development.\n\nIn a PBS that aired over 30 years ago, professionals that dealt with \u201cproblem youth \u2013 those having brushes with the law\u201d where asked about their findings \u2013 to which they replied that \u201cthese youth were unanimous in saying  that nobody cares.\u201d\nRegarding my friends with children I have seen that those parents \u201cwho strive to be an example\u201d and care about their children happen to be the ones whose children achieved better lives in terms of work and family life.   , 8 This week is another heartbreaking example of our failing political system and shallow media coverage.  Why don't journalists, especially those from television: \n\nInterview on camera the CEOs of gun manufacturers and their Boards of Directors.  Ask them how Sturm Ruger, Smith & Wesson, Glock, and Sig Sauer \"feel\" about their weapons of death.  And don't forget their institutional investors such as Fidelity, Vanguard and Blackrock.  \n\nAsk every Congressperson who benefits from NRA contributions what they plan to do to increase gun safety.  My NC Senators Richard Burr ($7 million) and Thom Tillis (over $4 million) have A+ NRA ratings.  Do not let them evade with, \"it's too soon,\" \"thoughts and prayers,\" and \"this is a mental health issue,\" (especially if they voted to dismantle ACA and its mental health care coverage).\n\nBroaden interview respondents beyond the same legislators and pundits.  Let's hear more from public health researchers on which measures are shown to be effective in reducing gun-related deaths and injuries.  The Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research is just one of many respected groups.  \n\nWe need aggressive, unflinching journalists who are not afraid to shine the light again and again on our shame.  , 8 The right made anti-abortion fervor a litmus test for candidates.  The left should do the same with gun control.  The solution for all of this horror lies inside the ballot box. My sympathies to the author, but, more importantly, my vote will be for candidates at all levels who will act to effectuate real change. I am tired, embarrassed and scared that voters in this country keep making choices which benefit only a few and punish or kill the rest of us. I hope to live long enough to see this country led by younger, more diverse and less self-centered individuals who will actually serve the people not just the interests of a handful of wealthy, insecure and uncharitable types who are incapable of introspection and relentlessly dedicated to preserving their skewed vision of what this country is supposed to be. , 8 I recall when I first saw the photos of Emmett Till in his casket. It was years after Emmett was buried. Being caucasian and raised in the south, I didn't even know of his murder until the early 60s when I became friends with some Florida A&amp;M students who I worked with (part time) while attending FSU. \n\nThey showed me the photos from JET magazine, the only national publication that published them. It was Emmett's mom who insisted he be viewed in an open casket so all could see how her son suffered. I have never forgotten that photo, it has been 56 years now. \n\nWhile I cannot imagine the horror and suffering of the parents of the kids at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School or Columbine or Sandy Hook, I can imagine it is no less than that of Emmett's mom. Emmet's mom's willingness to endure the ongoing horror of seeing the disfigured body of her son in that casket changed the narrative of the civil rights struggle forever. \n\nSeeing the mangled bodies of the children from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  and Sandy Hook Elementary will change the narrative of our struggle to rein in the slaughter of our fellow citizens. No one walks away from seeing the mangled body of a child unchanged, not even the NRA's LaPierre or djt. \n\nI beg of the parent's of these slaughter children, show us those photos. Make us face the reality of our cowardice and indifference.\n\nYoung women of our nation, adopt the Lysistrata paradigm. If you own a gun, take it to the prom., 8 Because a few American's think it's cool to own and fire machine guns with huge ammunition clips at old cars. We tolerate those weapons in our schools and the politicians that literally live off NRA contributions just so that a few dudes can have their fun on Saturday mornings. Those are the facts. Look at the simple reforms Australia put in place years ago. There is a solution, it is easy, if the GOP leadership loved school children they'd do this for them. The GOP won't change so expect to face these school shootings for decades to come. They call that 'freedom,' not what it really is, a tool enabling mass murder in our kid's schools., 8 The cameramen and reporters need to ask those who advocate for gun rights why they believe it is more important to defend the right for anyone to buy a gun designed to kill people than it is to keep citizens safe from those who might use guns for their intended purpose. , 8 We  we allow our children to be killed by automatic weapons in their schools and move on. We allow the homeless veteran to remain on the street. We give tax cuts to the wealthiest of among us, and cut the budgets of Medicare and Medicaid. We allow the pharmaceutical industry to reap huge profits without demanding lower rates for our citizens. We \u201c treat\u201d the mentally ill by jailing and imprisoning them. We disparage diplomacy ant threaten war. Some of us are hoodwinked by a Narcissist into believing he can help fix our desperation. We have lost our way., 8 Snarl, sister, snarl.  My son died in August, of illness, not violence.  I have often thought since then, playing \u201ccomparidown,\u201d that dying by suicide or murder  would be worse.  So I may understand about the loss of your loved one as well as the loss of the lives you all should have lived, I cannot fully understand the depths of your grief and anger.  The recent film, \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is about the destructive power of anger and grief.  Maybe we should be harnessing those emotions and pushing to stop this unacceptable carnage.  The surviving kids in Florida are demanding answers and action.  I thought after Sandy Hook that if we were willing to accept the murders of small children, we would accept anything.  But maybe we need to follow the kids this time, snarls at the ready.  , 8 We are reading these school shootings are an \u201cAmerican phenomenon.\u201d\nAs the saying goes \u201cIt takes a village\u2026\u201d   the author in analysis of societal attitudes hits the point\nSo, may be we should consider some of the differences in societal and civic characteristics with other countries - such as some of the European countries.    I lived Spain, Germany, and France\u2014and  my friends born in these countries agree with me;  I have been struck  \u2013and  still after 35+ yrs of living in the US it still surprises me, the lack of empathy and the galling complacency of a lot of people  I know\u2014just average person.  I guess it could be transposed to other parts of the US population --.\nI know  studies in the past about youth at risk had  the findings  that these kids feel \u201cnobody cares.\u201d    Its known people in situations where they feel \u201cpsychologically\u201d isolated (in jails, homelessness, confined) tend more to develop mental disturbances.\nWe also know that the odds of children from upper middle class families and close knit families to have problems with the law are much lower than those from families with problems\u2014jail, joblessness .  Close friends caring parents with exemplary lives have successful well adjusted kid- close friends  who do , 8 It will become readily clear what it's all about: money. \n\nAsk Marco Rubio if he would trade his $3 million from the NRA for the lives of those 17 kids and teachers.  He has said stricter gun laws wouldn't have prevented the shooting so we have our answer. If Florida wants Rubio to represent them, they must accept the consequences of their decision., 8 We know one thing for certain--it is *always* boys who engage in rampaging school massacres. All boys in our society are bombarded with erroneous messages that tell them that to be \"real\" men they can't have emotions, which in turn means they are not supposed to have compassion for others, and also that violence is expected of so-called real men.  Watch portrayals of \"real masculinity\" in Hollywood films to see this.\n\nTypical messages about masculinity are based on the contention that to be \"real men\" boys and men cannot, essentially, be fully human.  Our society  harms boys and men by not allowing them to be fully human, and by normalizing violent masculinity in which most male violence is directed at other males.  Women too are victims, but not at the rates that boys/men are victimized by other males.\n\nThis is an explanation based on empirical research on the topic, it is NOT an excuse for such heinous behavior.  People need to see how society contributes to normalized male violence to find the best way to end it. When we finally stop making ideal/stereotypical masculinity so limited, so impossible to achieve, and so dehumanizing/violent, and start accepting the fact that masculinity can be highly diverse and should not be about physical violence and control, gun laws won't be necessary because the connection between masculinity, guns, and violence will no longer be accepted.\n\nOf course that will take some time, so until that time we must fix our gun laws, immediately. , 8 Thank you.  I feel welcome to the club now that my 96 year old father did by self inflicted gun shot last November 1st.  I am still recovering. And now this.  I do not have the strength to face all this., 8 If there is a similar shooting that has ever happened in a Private or Catholic school, or a home school for that matter, I have not heard of it.\n\nWhy is that the case?\n\nLearning the answer might contribute to solving the problem., 8 I once attended a talk given by a chief of police about whether or not it was a good idea to keep a gun in the home for protection.  He posed this scenario.  You wake up in the middle of the night hearing noises downstairs.  You get your gun out of the bedside table and creep into the hallway that leads to the living room.  You see a figure in the darkness.  Now, will you shoot that figure, or will you say something like, \"Halt, who goes there?\"  If the latter, you should not have a gun, because you are most likely to be the one shot.  Decency loses, he said.  Have a phone in the bedroom and call 9-1-1.   Climb out a window if possible.  Don't engage. , 8 A smashing good resort to common sense, informed argument and soulful recognition of the continued savagery enjoyed by too many Americans with guns. The gun has been called The Equalizer by its advocates, which reveals\nthose same people walk around feeling unequal.  They may well be, but they have company with most of the rest of us who aren't wealthy enough to hire armed guards and well=secured mansions.  , 8 Most Americans don't care very much.  That's the honest truth.  So the gun lobby wins and will probably keep on winning.  Wish I could say something different., 8 I saw a video of a screaming mother over the last few days demanding  that Trump put metal detectors in every school to prevent this kind of violence. Tragically, that will not work, By the time a kid has committed to shooting up his school, the metal detector and it's operator are only one small obstacle to shoot their way through. It will take just seconds, and then the mad demon is loose within the school.\n\nNo, the real control point is getting as much space and barriers between military style automatic weapons and angry young men as possible. That has to happen long before the kid and AR-15 even arrive on school grounds.\n\nToo many advanced military style guns, far too readily available: it has to stop at the dealers and the sellers. Once the gun is in the hands of the buyer, a vast portion of the battle is already lost.\n\nI am a gun owner, but like so many others, my mind boggles at any of the logic used to justify putting such rampaging lethality in the hands of a civilian! Wrong Is Wrong!, 8 Just as our country is divided politically and philosophically, we are also on opposite sides of the great wall of paranoia which grows higher and firmer with each tragedy involving guns and the innocent victims of gun violence. Gun lovers are afraid their weapons will be taken from them and the rest of us feel as though those killing machines would be turned on us before their owners would dream of giving them up. During the 1970's and 80's gun manufacturers sold untold millions of weapons of war to our government for distribution throughout the world to fighters involved in U.S. proxy wars. All in the name of freedom. Many of those weapons are now pointed back at this country. Today, America is the new and very lucrative market for killing machines. And again, those weapons are being pointed at our citizens, all in the name of freedom. Where will we be ten years from now? My hope is the next generation, after living under the gun as they do now, will determine a new path for our country. Otherwise, our own fear will accomplish what no foreign enemy has been able to., 8 We are a nation of individuals not prone to think of ourselves as a community of people with a concern about the collective good, security, health and well being of those around us. Our emphasis is on the \"me\" not the \"we\" of life. We are witness to these atrocities but act as bystanders not participants who could and should do something to protect not just ourselves but our neighbors, families and friends and strangers. Mr. Gibson is correct in his assertion that these mass shootings are just so much media drama for most of us including our political leaders.\n\nI do not expect this to change. The only way this will change is if we insist on the \"right\" to have weapons  and have open carry in the halls of Congress and remove all security personnel., 8 I applaud Chuck Todd on MSNBC's Meet The Press for allowing 5 students from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School to fully express their views directly to the public, Congress, and President Trump. These very articulate, intelligent and passionate students have given notice to Congress and the President, that they will be on the wrong side of history if they don't ACT.  THANK YOU students and parents of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School; you are the voices of leadership we've been waiting for., 8 For all the ideals we aspire to, the values we espouse, the empathy that wells up as tears in our eyes, the reality of America is money.\n\nThe money the NRA and gun makers use to bribe politicians to join their conspiracy of mayhem and murder. The money that hedge funds make buying failing gun makers, fixing and selling them for huge gains. The money that's the gun makers' profit, as they chase new markets as the number of guns exceeds the number of people.  \n\nThe red streak that runs through a raging river of money is the blood that flows from the commerce of murder. Red that everywhere signals stop and danger is drowned by the green torrent of money yelling Go for It, petal to metal, all clear ahead.\n\nMoney doesn't talk, Dylan declared, it screams. Multi-billion dollar lawsuits won by victims of Big Tobacco, Asbestos, Ford's exploding rear gas tank Pinto, Thalidomide, and dozens of other deadly products, have driven them from the market and saved millions of lives.\n\nIf the parents of Sandy Hook could have sued gun makers, the billions of dollars in wrongful death, negligence and punitive damages would have bankrupted them or forced them to make a safer product.  \n\nBut Sandy Hook parents and every other slaughter since can't sue. A bill passed by Sen Bernie Sanders exempts gun makers from consumer liability. Vermonters like their guns and Sanders likes being their senator. \n\nForget gun control. Fight for the right to sue. Literally make them pay.\n\nMoney is bullet proof., 8 As long as we have the Senate and the House of Representatives benefiting from NRA contributions, their influence and lobbyists, nothing will change with regards to gun legislation in this country. Mass shooting after mass shooting and all I read and hear from those in the political arena supporting the NRA is now is not the time to discuss gun control. When discussions finally surface it is not about the weapons of mass murder but the perpetrator as being mentally challenged or some other lame excuse\u2026\u2026it is never the weapon.\n\nIt is time to focus on the ones who empower the NRA, our government. Yes, those elected officials who lay back and do nothing when it concerns the NRA and gun legislation due their self interest and preservation of their respective positions. We know who these individuals are in congress benefiting from the NRA dollars. The focus and targets of anger and frustration should be on them\u2026\u2026including the President. Their names need to be blasted all over the media, new stations, internet, billboards ,etc; for the carnage they have permitted through irreprehensible inaction and condoning of the NRA until they are voted out. \n\nAmerica has to send a very strong message that enough is enough and take back our government., 8 Thank you Mr. Gibson. I agree with you. I support you and stand beside you.\n\nI can't handle it anymore. We need to do something. We need to sue the government, via the ACLU and in conjunction with the various non profit anti gun violence organization. For putting childrens lives at risk as they seek their right of an education, for committing to those who bribe them instead of their country, for corruption. I could go on.\nShame. Shame on them for putting Emma Gonzalez and our children through this. No child should go through this. It is the children that will make change. They will change the laws. What is happening will be recorded as a very sick few decades of corruption in our government. The names of those not acting listed in the history books. Lest we forget.\nChildren are sacred.  I am angry. And going to use my anger to advance the change. , 8 I've suggested it before, so I'll suggest it again. Maybe this will gain some traction:\nPut a steep tax on the purchase of every bullet. Guns don't kill people -- bullets do! If the government were to put such a huge, expensive surcharge are bullets, then eventually bullets would become an expensive commodity just to even use one.\nThe money collected from this exorbitant tax on bullets could go the victims' families and also would probably help bolster the social services that the Republicans keep gutting.\nYes, I'm still trying to figure out how we might implement this. But, really, how else to stop the carnage if the guns don't have any bullets?, 8 25 years. Surreal to think of it that way. To think, the first time I heard of a school shooting I was in fifth grade, and now I'm 30, and nothing has been done in all this time., 8 Thank you. And I hope this gets through. , 8 No parent should have to go through what you and thousands of others have. It is time to shine a spotlight on elected officials who accept donations from the NRA. People attending campaign events in 2018 should show up with one of two signs: Thank you for not accepting donations from the NRA or Explain to us why you accepted $ (fill in the amount) in donations from the NRA.\nIf it happened at every event across the country it would make a difference in how people vote. And hopefully it would make those running for office think twice about accepting donations from the NRA and being beholden to them.  , 8 Along with mentioning the Second Amendment, we should always add that the guns used at that time in history were muzzle loaders requiring 30 seconds to one minute between shots (depending on the skill and reflexes of the user). Our ancestors brought down enough game to feed themselves and their families -- and won their freedom from an oppressive regency -- using only those guns.\nWould the mass shooting casualties decrease if gun owners were limited to the technology in place when the Second Amendment was written? Does anyone actually believe our founding fathers could even imagine bump stocks and rapid-fire AR-15s? And what twisted, sick mind could think anyone would ever need such a weapon in civilian life?, 8 I wonder what role the extensive media coverage of the perpetrators of this violence plays in their decision making.  Perhaps it would help if each media outlet mentioned the shooters name only once and focused more on those who are injured and killed.  Damaged young men get the idea that shooting up a school will give them media attention and a stage for whatever their complaints are.  Cut that off and perhaps there would be less of this kind of violence.  I'm not suggesting this instead of new and better laws about owning firearms, but along with that.  Remove some of the attention and imagined glamour!  , 8 I'm fed up too.  The author mentions that seeing horrible photos of gun victims might change hearts.  It just might.  We need to remove guns now.\n\nI remember back in the 1950s when in school they would show a movie in \"assembly\" of nothing but horrible car crashes.  Did it change actions?  To safer driving.  maybe?  , 8 Thank you for calling out the obscenity, not only of these violent attacks, but of our passive consumption of them as infotainment.\nMy hope is in the Parkland survivors who are turning their grief into fury., 8 A gunshot to the head killed my nephew, the result of a conflict with his friend who had just come home after two tours of duty in Afghanistan. Trained to kill, but not trained how to re-enter society or how to handle conflict as a civilian, his PTSD friend falls into a similar category with those mentally unstable shooters who are taking the lives of our children. They need to be identified and helped before another tragedy happens., 8 You have paid the highest price for what some call \u201cfreedom\u201d but is little other than macho posturing by afraid people with no answers.\nThe best thing about this administration is the comfort given to gun owners, so much so that the manufacturers are going out of business without fear to sell. That is one of the few good things happening on the weapons front., 8 I made the mistake of trying to discuss what could be done with a relative (and their friend/acquaintance) on Facebook about how to prevent these tragedies. What they said were to blame was: inadequate mental health resources (blamed on \u201cliberals\u201d), culture (lack of respect for parents etc). Any attempt to point out that guns are the issue were met with blankness. Pointing out that the U.K. has strict gun controls and doesn\u2019t have mass shootings was met with \u201cwell, what about the terror attacks in London?\u201d (Which were cars by the way) or \u201cChicago is a gun free area and they have a high homicide rate\u201d. The US has more guns than any other country in the world \u201cwe\u2019re a very big country\u201d. When I asked what the issue with gun control was \u201cit will impact law abiding citizens the most\u201d. It\u2019s like mentally pro gun people are unable to acknowledge that weapons might kill, and not having these weapons would stop killing. It\u2019s so simple and yet so beyond some peoples\u2019 grasps , 8 Thank you for this column and your courage in speaking out. As a survivor of my huband's suicide, not by a firearm, I am in frequent contact with thousands of victims of gun violence. Not only are our politicians failing us but also multi-million dollar organizations such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) which partners with the National Sports Shooting Foundation (NSSF), a gun lobbying group that promotes the A-15 assault weapon and gun marketing in schools. We must follow the lead of the young people and break the silence and stranglehold regarding who is truly profitting from the sale of guns in America., 8 Yes, America.\n\nLand of the free.  And home of the gaping exit wound.\n\nYet, it's actually not true, as people in other countries think, that all of us are high-falutin' cowboys, packing multiple automatic weapons, shooting at anything that moves.   There are numerous sane communities, and a number of sane states, where the right to a firearm is not sacrosanct and regulated closely.   As noted, these places tend to have much lower rates of firearm death.   The problem is, there aren't enough of them, and sometimes they're located next to places that don't possess that sanity and which provide freely flowing guns for the ne'er do wells in the saner locations.\n\nWe do have to address the fundamental attitudes about guns in those places.   It's not about the 2nd amendment, though that remains a convenient crutch (it does say \"well regulated militia\", implying regulation).   It's more closely related to fear of the other, very often the black or brown or Muslim other.   And given that this is a mostly male phenomenon, it's really time to look into the sexual link (too many don't like to talk about the whole expulsion/penetration metaphor).   Don't know if there's any psychological evidence on this, but I'm willing to bet that the most gun loving places and people are also the most anxious about male role and sexuality., 8 Instead of following around victims of these tragedies and asking them how they feel, the media should be publishing a list of the politicians who receive funds from the NRA and how much they receive. But they are afraid to do that. But such a list should be published in bold letters in as many newspapers and social network sights as possible. This list should be updated and republished say monthly or quarterly. Perhaps up to date gun death statistics would appear in the margins, or real photos of real victims. How about a milk carton campaign. As painful as this kind of promotion might be for those who have lost loved ones, the \u201cThe Club No One Wants To Join\u201d might be the best sponsor as any other entity would be attacked by the NRA and discredited. Where do we send our donations?, 8 Mr. Gibson describes how the \"iconography of televised mass shooting reports\" makes us \"consume it [the suffering] rather than experience it\", making us \"dead to it by now\". \n\nTrue. \n\nI used to think that it didn't matter that many of us consume gun-based entertainment on a regular basis. Yet, here we are, talking about how televised mass shooting reports do numb us. \n\nWe are mainly talking about bloodless (in every sense of the word) snippets of footage, a lot of which is post-massacre. \n\nDoes the steady stream of violence-driven entertainment - in which people get beaten, stabbed, shot, and more - flowing out of the entertainment industry really *not numb* us at all?\n\nMy experience is that I initially get affected, but eventually get into the habit of numbing myself to whatever suffering I see.\n\nBy now, are we used to seeing someone get shot on a screen as a part of a plot?\n\nYes, we are. And many of us are completely unaffected.\n\nDo we transfer this apathy to real-world incidents? \n\nGiven that we now predominantly consume both fiction and real-world happenings through the shields of screens, I really do not know the answer to that.\n\nBut I do know this, and I'd like to borrow the words of others to express it: \n\nOur dead brains must face the fact that we don't want such entertainment to stop.\n\nIf we wanted it to stop, we'd do something about it., 8 It's horrible, this paid Congressional intransigence to almost any regulation of firearms, thanks to the NRA lobbying.\nBut what's really telling is that the NRA if not even on the list of the top 50 lobbying organizations that buy control of our governmental initiatives, or finance a permanent lack thereof.\nThe top 50 are almost all- excluding the Chamber of Commerce which is numero uno- big pharma, insurance corporations, petroleum corporations, medical care corporations, high tech etc.\nAre we- or is any nation- capable of resisting a veritable tsunami of dollars and implementing real change?, 8 As the mother of a child who died by suicide, I know more than I would like about \"the club that no one wants to join.\"\n\nI sincerely believe we will overcome the pernicious influence of the NRA and the politicians it has in its pocket. Voices like yours, and those of the courageous young people in Florida (and elsewhere) who are fighting for their right to live without fear, are too righteous and truthful to be ignored forever. The vast majority of the people of the U.S. want sensible gun policy -- if we keep our voices strong, and never stop fighting, we will prevail!, 8 Who knew we had a club. \n\nThere was a time when I was the only kid in the room who had been shot. I was 10 in 1960 when my father was handling a .45 automatic pistol and accidentally discharged it. He got the gun because he wanted to protect his family. \n\nNow I live in the woods by myself. It\u2019s private, gently beautiful, calm. There are also feral hogs and meth labs. My family demands that I get a gun to \u201cprotect myself\u201d in much the same way that gun advocates insist that school teachers carry guns to protect children. \n\nI\u2019ve experienced first hand what can happen to children when we insist that guns SOLVE problems without understanding that guns, themselves, ARE the problem. , 8 This is all about money. \n\nMedia still has the ethos of \"If it bleeds, it leads\". Advertising, folks, is what pays the bills. Long gone are the days when real reporters were subsidized by networks to fulfil the founders' reliance the on the press as a counterweight to power. Media has been merged into fewer hands, and like much else these days, it carries a message rather than reports. Watch the speech at the end of Good Night and Good Luck by Edward R Murrow and you see the coming nightmare.\n\nDemocracy remains a shell, left in place so we don't notice the loss of its substance. America's well off no longer want to pay for democracy. They want \"my money\". So \"47%\" of us are deadbeats and the institutions that once promoted a sense of fairness, protection and shared prosperity are under attack. People are made to believe the one entity that protects them is the enemy: government. To then solidify the point: politicians work for donors. We chose as we hold our nose. They comply rather than lead. Russians and the rich sow social and political discord to get their way.\n\nWhere am I going? We have representative institutions that fail to represent. They can no longer do so because money rules. The fact that most Americans are disgusted and heartbroken by the continual display of shattered children's bodies matters not. \"Leaders\" only pretend to listen while they quickly speak in talking points.\n\nYou want safety for our children? It will require a movement to take our country back., 8 My heart goes out to you on the unthinkable loss of your son.  It must seem like a loss each time these mass shootings repeat, and you don't know if your son's death was in vain.  Of course, I don't know how you feel, but I can understand why the question of 'how does it feel' was so insulting when asked in search of a sound bite.  Serious issues don't lend themselves to splashy responses.\nYou are onto something when you suggest showing the grisly images to drive home what gun death means.  It is tricky, because who someone was is larger than the moment they died.  But still, the gun lobby uses visceral imagery, like arousing fear of criminality and a sense of heroism for the supposed chance to be 'a good guy with a gun.'  Take the visceral argument out from them by showing what more easy access to guns really looks like.\nThe crime scene photos probably still aren't as horrific as how it feels.  That just can't be fully conveyed., 8 I watched quite a few fictional, highly choreographed massacres on TV last night. In between that \"drama\" local news station commercials showed kids walking out of a school with their hands on each others' shoulders and I felt a moment of sadness for those poor kids.  Then two guys in a car tried to sell me a hamburger before I went right back to another series of murders. \n\nSchool shootings come to the majority of us as stories on the TV, right alongside other content.  Most of the time though the neatly ordered moral universe of TV cop shows and hero movies, where some characters will die so the protagonist can be brought to justice (usually his death), gives us closure within 30 to 90 minutes.  Real shootings don't fit that clean model, and we get that it's somehow different, but is it really?  The next night we're back watching more fictional murders on TV.  \n\nWhen the reporter asks \"how does it feel?\" I think he genuinely wants to know, while simultaneously he really doesn't want to know at all.  , 8 Just about any gun you want you can get on the street, just like drugs. If you make it harder to buy guns is robbery going to stop? No, people will still steal guns. Therefore gun violence will not end just because you make the laws stricter. People need to learn gun safety, trained how to shoot, and teachers should be allowed to carry. If every adult in a school had a gun on their hip what are the odds a student is going to start shooting? Slim to none because they'll get shot before they can fire., 8 not care \u201ctoo much\u201d about their children who  happen to be \u201cproblem\u201d adults.   I would imagine a random study could shed some light.\nParents are very important in a person development.   I have seen it in my parents.  And I am a living example\u2014I  have had wonderful parents that have helped me survive number of very tragic events in my life\u2014events I've been told would drive a lot of people insane.\nWe know that Mr. Cruz was adopted.  I would like to know how much weight this factor had in the development of his feelings toward society in general.      But  it would probably shed some light if it were to be studied.\nAnyway, let hope that this tragic event will be the trigger that drives self-analysis and across the line changes that are , 8 At the very least, we must make it difficult to obtain the AMMUNITION for the assault weapons. \n\nAnother thing, let's get more graphic testimonies in the media  from first responders, surgeons, emergency doctors and nurses and other trauma personnel. The gory details have to be shoved in our faces. , 8 Gregory,  \n\nAs deeply wounding for you as sharing the photograph of your child would be, it would be the bravest thing you could ever do.  I listened to a biography of Emmet Till's mother a few weeks ago and it renewed my sense that if any photographs of the Sandy Hook murders were released at the time, guns would be done in America.   \n\nEvery parent wants to remember and present to the world their loved one and child as they saw them - happy, healthy and the vibrant soul they were.  I totally understand why pictures of their last moment never come out and stay only in the tortured minds of the families and responders.  But if we all had to confront the reality that you have had to confront - not the Hollywood image - guns would be done.  They would be done.  \n\nThey would be Gone.  \n\nIt wasn't until I went abroad and saw the graphicness of the news coverage in other countries that I understood that our media shields us from the horrors of wars, conflicts between peoples, etc.  It allows Americans to be heartless regarding oppressed people, terrorism, government crackdowns, etc.  Because we don't see the real costs - we can sit and have paper debates without realizing the ferment of anger in the world we are causing.  It is the same with the gun debate.  People couldn't turn an eye to the beating that Mr. Till took.  They shouldn't be allowed to look away from our bullet-ridden babies., 8 \"We were already too deep in the weeds. The camera light snapped off; the reporters moved on.\"  This is the essence of the problem. We do not have the guts to stay focused on the gun issues, we cannot tolerate looking at our own inaction and admit we don't stay in the fight. We do not act at the voting booth and we allow the continuation of the atrocities., 8 Thank you for expressing your disgust over questions about \"feeling\". Unfortunately, many in our society don't \"feel\" except by witnessing the traumatic pain of others. Because they don't actually, as an individual, \"feel\" pain when they witness the carnage in the news, it makes it bearable for members of our society to see children and other innocents slaughtered by one individual who has the power of one gun. It reminds me of the strangest comment I received many years ago when my husband died traumatically, suddenly and young. It came from a purportedly caring coworker who looked me in the eye and said, \"I don't know how I would feel\" as if I was supposed to help HER understand how to feel about a traumatic loss just days after mine. The \"feeling\" is so visceral and so violent that it betrays the sadness that is left behind forever. Your life ends with such a loss. The road forks and you travel a new path, a new life, while your loved one drifts away with your heart. But why would I entrust a perhaps well meaning, but careless someone like her with that \"feeling\" of mine?\n\nI came away from my personal loss with a continued awareness of the gutting pain of other people's losses. I'm afraid that many just won't take gun violence seriously because they really don't \"feel\" the problem., 8 I hate to sound cynical, but at this point after so many needless deaths I can't help myself. There is only one thing that can change the mind of legislators about control and sensible gun laws; that is money. The NRA has bought legislators lock stock and barrel. In some cases it is through outright donations, in other it is through threats of financially supporting opposing candidates. The NRA is basically a powerful crime syndicate that imposes it's will on the country for profit. The only way to defeat such an entity is by becoming a bigger and more powerful voice for the American people in opposition. Create an equivalent  centralized lobbying organization that has limitless funds and you will have the ear of legislators. They are only attuned to the sound of money...not heart break., 8 Continuing.......\n\nAnd I believe I could be a case in study.     In my personal life I have had a relatively happy and achieving life in modest terms \u2013 and emotionally I am a happy person \u2013 despite having had experiences that according to 3 professionals would  drive some wacko\u2014being discriminated at work \u2013 despite having a top-notch performance, being very close to die because of illness,  being physically assaulted, being ostracized put down quite frequently.    And I feel the most precious gift is my life is \u2013   my parents.    When I read all this I give thanks to the Almighty  over and over for my parents.\nI am not aware whether studies have been done on the relationship between these shooter youth and their parents.   If so, they should be reviewed.   And if not, they should be done.\n\nAnd also schools and those in charge of forming teenagers should bring to their attention these facts.     No excuses.    The price to pay for a no-say-nothing attitude is definitely too high., 8 \"I know of a survivor who has a crime-scene photograph of her daughter\u2019s bullet-riddled corpse. When she speaks with politicians about gun laws, she shows them the photograph. I have a similar photograph of my son. Perhaps the time has come to use it.\"\n\nI have always thought that members of Congress should be required to see photos of the Sandy Hook kids before they vote on any gun legislation.  See what these weapons they defend do to children they have a duty to protect. , 8 Is there an equivalent to Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge for guns? I did a quick search, and all the pledges that came up were for me, the voter. I'm already voting that way, and I want to turn this back on the lawmakers. I would like to see two things included:\n\n1. A commitment to banning gas-powered, semiautomatic rifles\n2. A promise to lift the restrictions on gun violence research\n\nIf this already exists, I want it to get the same attention and stranglehold on the Democrats that Norquist's pledge has on the Republicans., 8 The real issue has always been a mental health issue and not a gun issue.\n\nCruz was known to be unstable, yet multiple entities failed to intervene, and a system for identifying and flagging him as requiring extra checks before a firearm purchase does not yet exist.\n\nA system like that needs to be developed, but not at the expense of the rights of healthy law abiding citizens. Its need basis needs to be narrowly  defined and mechanisms for recourse need to be available for those restricted by it, in the case of an unfair determination.\n\nBut let's be crystal clear on one thing.\n\nThere is no place for emotion in the legislative process.\n\nIt is supposed to be a cold, rational, secular process, detached from the heat of passion.\n\nIt amazes me that so many lefties refuse to acknowledge that fact.\n\nBut when your argument cannot be supported by rational means, emotion is all that is left., 8 Most families of gun victims live in the inner cities and believe that the causes of their suffering are diverse, including poverty and prejudice.  Most survivors of mass killings target the guns.  To communicate the impact of guns, Mr. Gibson includes all the inner city victims.  Yet the victims of mass killings and the inner city victims don't communicate much.  Together, they would have a more powerful story to tell., 8 Maybe, we,  as American's need to start following the example the last group of students hope to set.   Walk out of school, work, the mall, the beauty shop etc on 03/14 and 04/20.    If our voices are still not recognized in congress then we converge on Washington in May.    Big money has taken over and there is no dollar amount worth the life of a child.    Together we stand, divided we fall.  , 8 The freedom to access unlimited firearms seems more important to many than valuing human life. For these people, there is no association with easy access and an abundance of firearms to loss of life. They accept the NRA propaganda that the more armed society is the safer it will be, despite obvious statistics to the contrary. Freedom should not be absolute at the expense of public health. Can this be achieved without campaign finance reform and publicly funded elections?, 8 When I took drivers education in high school we were required to watch a graphic video of car accidents.  My son and daughter's driver education instructors required them to watch an updated version.  Their instructors were retired police officers who spoke about their experiences with accident scenes.  Just as that video left an impression on me 30 yeas before it left one their 16 and 17 year old minds--speed kills and you are driving 4,000 lbs. weapon.    \n\nPoliticians before accepting money from the gun lobbies should be made to view graphic videos and help clean up after shooting.  I am sure they would be less inclined to say \"we shouldn't make hasty decisions and our prayers and thoughts are with the victims and their families.\"  The 2nd Amendment was written when black powder was used on the dueling grounds and the War for Independence., 8 Requiring insurance with every gun and ammo sale is the most practical solution I've heard to taking the first steps on the road to sensible gun policy.\n\nNot to be cynical, but maybe it takes another unscrupulous industry lobby to contend with the former in our political environment.\n\nThe insurance companies would get to pick up some lucrative fees, and the cost of ownership and business expenses would increase for gun buyers, sellers and owners. Like cigarettes with younger smokers, raising the price is the most effective proven restraint.\n\nThe ability to add 'smart technology' could aid in the setting of insurance rates, as it seems plain that guns in more populated ares are inherently more likely to cause injury, then in a less populated space. (Probably why the issue is perceived differently in rural America).\n\nIf I recall, President Obama said it would be necessary for voters to become \"single issue voters\" to finally marginalize the NRA out of American politics.\n\nWhile that's a worthy goal to pursue, until then, gun insurance is an available and likely effective short term fix., 8 Time to repeal the Second Amendment. The Constitution was not written in stone. It is a piece of paper. An overwhelming majority of Americans agree something must be done. Imagine if The Constitution read \"A well educated citizenry, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear books, shall not be infringed.\" Book ownership, like the ownership of an automobile, an airplane, a dog, or a gun, need not be specified as a \"right.\" We have all these things and more because we have a well-regulated economy. License to drive a car? Check. License to fly a plane? Check. License to own a dog? Check. Government regulates most things, and it should. It is time for common sense gun control by starting from the premise that owning a gun is not a right, but a privilege, one that is earned, not guaranteed., 8 It seems strange that the same litigious society that requires car insurance to drive, and has completely changed the shape of school playgrounds because of liability concerns, allows the carnage caused by guns to continue. Where are the lawsuits? Why are our tax dollars going to pay for the carnage without repercussions? Has the NRA silenced the legal and insurance professionals as well as our government? The only answer is to vote out those of our representatives that do not stand for sane gun laws. November 2018 is time to make our voices heard loud and clear over the din of NRA money., 8 Mr. Gibson, thank you for not giving up.\n\nWhat keeps me discouraged is that existing gun laws get a tiny tweak here and there, but nothing of substance gets done; people keep dying by people using guns. Why should a civilian have the right to buy a AR-15 semi-automatic gun for any reason, including target practice? There are many other less destructive guns for that. And why should anyone have the right to sell guns similar to the AR-15? Surely human life is more valuable than monetary profit.\n\nI am under no illusion that the NRA, its members, or our politicians, will develop a guilty conscience. Nor share the feelings of shame many of the rest of their countrymen do. They will just circle the wagons to protect themselves. They will attempt to put a reasonable face on the murder of people who were of no harm to anyone. They will wiggle around, and obfuscate, the following:\n\n  In its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the Second Amendment protects, District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court ruled that the amendment protects an individual right \"to keep and carry arms in case of confrontation,\" not contingent on service in a militia, while indicating, in dicta, that restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations, and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass constitutional muster.\n\nIt is to our courts we must appeal to implement sanity into our gun laws., 8 We all grieve for the losses,  but they continue. The losses and the grieving.  The loss of life accompanied by the living death.  And those of us lucky enough,  or dare I say privileged enough, to not have suffered this way,  live in constant fear and worry that someday the glare of the camera lights will be upon us.   And then we will be faced with answering the question.  Sadly,  it is this fear upon which the media plays to sell copy and clicks,  and the profiteers of guns for all,  2nd amendment purists and cynical politicians use to make their cases and their money.  It is not the question of how we feel about what had happened, past tense, that will make any difference. The question we must each answer,  not in the glare of flash photography, but in the quiet shadows and personal darkness,  is this:  what are we doing and what will we be doing to avoid and prevent anyone else,  or many,  from having to answer these questions ever again. Thanks for the link to the Bloomberg organization.  I will start with a contribution., 8 With each gun death in America, I feel increasingly sad and more and more fearful.  I look longingly to places of relative tranquility like Australia, New Zealand or Canada and realize at my age I am ineligible to emigrate to a place of safety.  In America, we are individually and collectively surrounded within a shrinking circle of violence.  It is a repeat of the 1937 classic Leiningen Versus the Ants but, unlike Leiningen, we are buying and distributing our own ants., 8 I think it's fairly simple. NRA members vote. They vote reliably. They can be counted on. The huge majority of those who favor reasonable gun controls, background checks, etc., don't vote, or at least not reliably. Until that changes, congress will do nothing.\n\nTo all who did not vote in the last elections: if you don't like what you're getting right now, then do something about in in 2018 and 2020. Do the thing that really matters most in a democracy., 8 Both you and Himes have it right. Your pain is very real and you don't need anyone, let alone me to confirm it. I belong to a similar club. I really get it. I march on with one idea ( not necessarily hope) that the \"we\" who won't allow the \"change\" is not all of us. It stems form the incessant power of perhaps 4000 families at the top of the socio-economic structure. The rest of us could easily organize and wage a war to destroy them. Many societies have seen violent revolution as the only means to that end. I hope it doesn't happen to us., 8 I don't know how our country can move away from the gun culture to human decency and security. When I read about the lives and personalities of the victims I was struck with sorrow for the cruel end of their possibilities. This mass murder is a crime against all of our highest values.\nThe prevalence of guns, even hunting weapons, pose a national security threat that is pervasive and rooted in a type of testosterone driven ignorance and susceptibility of peer pressure. There are other rational that gun lobbies and enablers toute such as the second amendment but only through a distorted lens and reading of the actual intent of the documents wording. It's time to move away from the simple 18th century tones of a young nation struggling with the lessons learned from its emancipation to the realities of a nation where we call our neighbors enemies ( based on their race, religion, or political affiliation) and deny the actions of our real enemies.\nThe problems posed by guns are exasperated by other problems based in fear, intolerance and forgetting that cooperation and compromise are essential traits of our democracy. In order for us to fix such problems within our society, such as gun violence and opioids, we must address the systemic problems related to our attitudes towards these issues, accept and acknowledge the core disease, and work together for solutions.\nMaybe rectifying even this one major risk to our safety will show the pathway for other major national and world issues., 8 Lets propose an economic model, something that Republican's understand and love. Who are the benefactors that will support Republican legislators in this quest? Republicans legislate to line their pockets. Can we ask that gun laws be similar to driving laws, a huge money making industry? Everyone is eligible to drive but must pass certain tests to ensure the safety of others. We restrict cars from children, so why do we allow kids to access to guns at home and allow teens to own guns? Gun owners should meet certain requirements for health, sanity, age, intent of use, etc., just as drivers do. Imagine if just anyone could drive on the Expressway? Do driving licenses restrict liberty or ensure the liberty of others? Can a blind person buy a gun? Ask those with guns to pay liability insurance and guarantee their use will not infringe upon our own right to life. Demand common sense, Right to Life After Birth laws. Associate gun ownership with banking, the real American Gods. When gun ownership becomes associated with the insurance industry, with wealthy benefactors, with mega money, Republicans will take notice. That is all they see in those Constitutional chambers, not teens in coffins or mourning families. , 8 First, Mr. Gibson, so sorry for your loss and pain you still suffer.  Thank you for speaking out so eloquently.\n\nUnfortunately, people will wring their hands and complain for a few days but then move on and nothing will happen until the next time it happens and then we\u2019ll have a repeat. , 8  Thank you, Mr. Gibson. No one has said it more convincingly or more compelling than this. If I could I'd make every NRA member and every elected official read this., 8 The sadness and grief is overwhelming. \n\nThe needed response, too, is overwhelming. We, as a democratic society, must elect politicians (generally Democrats) to both State and Federal office who will demand and legislate reasonable gun laws (and are not otherwise funded by the NRA), such as the elimination of high capacity, semi-automatic weapons from the civilian population. \n\nIf enough learned and reasonable minds can can rally the millions of otherwise apathetic voters to overwhelmingly vote for such candidates, perhaps, just perhaps, we might just get results.  , 8 Hard to read and not be humbled by the words of a survivor, survivor of multiple tragedies. The author is a member of a \"club\" that is trying to extinguish itself by not having more people to endure the enormous grief of a loved one, even anyone. \n\nI want to say something to him, but I am totally at a loss for words. \n\nWhat can I say?, 8 Reading what you said brought tears to my eyes and so agree that gun laws need to be changed. It's all about the money that politicians receive from the NRA etc. I think most of us feel powerless against our government. Our governor, when elected, voted in the right to carry a concealed weapon. Just doesn't make sense. You are right, we need to be more active and also vote for those politicians that agree that there should be background checks before being able to buy a gun, 8 Thank you for writing this exceptionally moving and candid essay. I read it last night and again this morning and will surely be re-reading and sharing it for a long time.  I have known no one who has lost a loved one to gun violence who does not believe something is terribly wrong with our country's policies. In fact I don't know anyone who hasn't lost a loved one to gun violence who disagrees either. There is so much that is wrong with our country but maybe, I pray, these young survivors of Parkland will be the shift we need. They give me hope., 8 Thank you Mr. Gibson for writing this piece and the work you are doing to advance stricter gun control in our country.  \n\nYou are right that no one wants to join the club of parents who have lost a child. \n\nBut please note that there are still many people who have not \"compartmentalized gun death, random mass shootings\". Many of us are deeply saddened by each person who has been gunned down in all these tragedies. We read their profiles and think about the wonderful lives taken too soon and the unspeakable hurt their loved ones must feel.  \n\nWe also call and write to our legislators, and we donate money to organizations pushing for stricter gun control. I've been writing to government officials since the early 1980s. I live in a town in New Jersey that is just like Newton, CT.  I write to our mayor and town council every year to implore them to take on this issue by imploring the NJ legislature to follow the example of Connecticut's gun control laws. \n\nPerhaps I and many of us can do more. But I venture to say that many more of the 90 percent polled are doing something beyond voicing their opinion when the pollster calls. In fact, 66 million people voted against the presidential candidate from the GOP who received $30 million from the NRA.  \n\nThe problem is not the complacency of most American citizens. It is the financial stranglehold the NRA and gun manufacturers have on the Republicans Party. The NRA owns the party and all the GOP politicians in office or vying of it. , 8 We just can't let our voices go unheard between now and November. We should be protesting in front of congressional members' offices who are in the NRA's pocket and the campaign offices of those running for office who won the primaries. Even if it's just one of us doing it. The media should be informative about who's getting money from where. We should be rallying right before the election. I'm not going to let myself give up this time. We can't slip into despair this time. We have to have and show the WILL. Sometimes I think about moving to a country that seems to care about protecting it's citizens but I'd rather see us become one too., 8 Thank you is not enough for your words and actions.  I'm so sorry for your loss and deeply grateful for your work.  It is way past time for us all to take corrective action.  , 8 It seems that this time we may be able to take a possible action on gun control.  The energy of youth may be enough to finally bring some sense to the Republican congress that up to now has been totally sold out to the NRA.  The connection of Russia to the NRA may also help bring sense to them.  A national effort by students is [possible/, 8 When it became clear that the 18th amendment had a dysfunctional effect on our society, we repealed it.  Why can we not suggest repealing the 2nd amendment?  Yes, I know it's politically impossible -- but normalizing the suggestion that gun ownership be a regulated privilege rather than an American right goes right to the heart of the issue.  I'm tired of being tied to the deadly sanctity of a constitutional rule when the society I live in and the social costs it yields have nothing to do with the 200-plus year old context that yielded it., 8 The spoiled brats of the gun lobby whine about their rights, and the cowrdly Congress listens.\n\nWhere are the rights of the rest of us?, 8 \"Not because I \u201cknow what they\u2019re going through.\u201d How could anyone truly know what other people are going through when they hear their teenager is dead?\"\n\nPerhaps the media thinks it can expiate the horror of mass murders by dwelling on the pain of the survivors. \n\nBut this insane curiosity about the pain of survivors always seems to trump the obvious, why did any of this have to happen in the first place?\n\nThe solution is pretty simple, per an article I read yesterday: the few studies on worldwide gun access that sneaked through under the cold eye of the NRA is this: the more guns a country possesses, the more deaths.\n\nYou do the math, yes,, we are first in sick statistic, and the world watches in disbelief that a citizen's right to bear arms--any type, even the most dangerous, no questions asked, no matter how unstable the buyer or the evil the intent-- is more important than a classroom of dead children. \n\nMr. Gibson, you're doing the most important work of your life in your advocacy and activism.  I thank you for this essay--it's powerful.  \n\nBut in my view,  two things must change in order to make real progress on changing gun laws.\n\nFirst the media's maudlin, inappropriate intrusions into family grief must stop: it only deflects attention from the obvious solution, gun laws must change.\n\nSecond, if voters are serious gun safety, they must vote only for non-NRA candidates. , 8 First - Mr. Gibson - thank you for your searing eloquence. And I\u2019m very sorry for your losses.\n\nSecond, while I\u2019ve lost faith in the legal and political systems to reduce the impact of guns, I have increased my interest in how economic and cultural choices can help:\n\n1. Everyone who buys or rents a home should look first at the rate of gun ownership in the community. Where I live, it\u2019s about 3% of households, which is quite low. People should talk about their community\u2019s rate in as many contexts as possible.\n\n2. Normalize the concept that guns should be insured. That speaks to their inherent danger. People who own guns need to pay for the potential damage that they will do to themselves or others.\n\n3. Ask businesses to post publicly whether guns are allowed in their establishments. \n\n4. My kids know that a gun owner is inherently a poor choice for a date or a mate. (I don\u2019t object to hunting but the choice of gun matters).  Gun owners should know that they are poor romantic prospects., 8 Media coverage of these shootings is a uniquely American form of pornography, and should be banned from the airways.  The coverage encourages copycats, which is one of the obscene things about it., 8 As a young nurse working in the emergency trauma center in a small town one night, a call came from an ambulance saying 1 minute eta, gunshot wound to the neck. It was a 2 year old child. Shot by her 5 year old brother. Point blank. I will never, ever forget what I saw.  The paramedics who rushed her tiny body in on a back board were bagging her and doing compressions. Her neck was splayed open. Blood was everywhere. Her eyes were open. It was awful. She was  getting me, but we worked on her for a long time No one wanted to give up. It was a somber night. \n\nThat image has stayed with me for decades. I cannot imagine being a parent who loses a small child or adult child to gun violence. This was done by a small caliber handgun. The carnage is unimaginable with the current crop of semi-automatic weapons. The first responders know. The parents know. But no one else seems to. Including the reporter who interviewed you. He or she has no clue. \n\nI am so sorry for the loss of the life you wanted with your son. , 8 My understanding is guns are not permitted in the NRA DC office building.\n\nThey say they are but really they are permitted in the shooting range part of the building.\n\nThey are not permitted in the office part of the building and people need to pass through a metal detector to enter.\n\nThe NRA knows what they are doing to this country, the gun culture they are creating and its results, and they are doing it solely for gun manufacturing profits., 8 After a mass shooting in Australia in 1996, they prohibited private gun sales, required that all weapons be individually registered to their owners, and required that gun buyers present a \u201cgenuine reason\u201d for needing each weapon at the time of the purchase.  After that there were no more mass shootings.  The weapons of mass destruction (AK 47s etc) are not in Iraq but in the USA!  \n\nTo resolve this is not impossible.  The tobacco lobby was very powerful and 20 years ago you saw smoking everywhere.  Now it has been banned in many public spaces.   Gun ownership is a health issue as well.  \n\nWhile there are different factors at play (61 percent of all gun owners are white men and constitutional questions), the fact is that the few that support extreme gun right derive their power because they are rabid and relentless in their support.  This is not the case with gun control advocates who are not well organized and don't have the political clout or respect that the NRA possesses.   \n\nThe gun control movement needs a \"me too\" moment when the public is stirred to \"sustained outrage\" over the violence caused by NRA's reckless opposition to any control of guns.   A one-time vigil in front of the NRA headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia is not sufficient.   Rise up and ban weapons of mass destruction! Make the people who support gun control uncomfortable and embarrassed like the smokers have become (and the Trump supporters)., 8 Normally this is the type of tragedy that unites a country, but hey\u2026 welcome to America.\nIt's happened so often that we now have a routine. \n\nStep 1. G.O.P sends their thoughts and prayers\nStep 2. G.O.P says its too soon to discuss politics\nStep 3. G.O.P blames it on mental health\nStep 4. Gun advocates online use their usual arguments\n\"Guns don't kill people, people kill people\" (yes, with a gun)\n\"Knives are just as dangerous, should we ban knives\" (only if we have an incident where one person can kill 50 people in one go with a knife)\n\u201cYou cannot change the second ammendment\u201d (the irony)\n\nRinse, Repeat\n\nThere is no amount of evidence, profesisonal advice, tears, pleas or lives that will change the mind of the right. Politics in this country has become so divided that anything the otherside of the aisle proposes is immediately vilified, even if its a policy that ensures that elementary school kids don\u2019t have to run drills for the case of a madman running into their school with an AR-15., 8 Guns are the problem and to remove the problem we must remove the guns.\n\nThe U.S. citizens have 260 million guns.  Why?, 8 Unfortunately, in today's self-centered \"me\" world, until these horrible, senseless and largely preventable tragedy hits home, few seem to care enough to take or demand actions be taken. There is no valid reason to have these human killing automatic rifles. In addition, there is little treatment, if any, more the majority of troubled individuals with mental health problems. Finally, this country is void of leadership at the highest leaders. It is truly sad what is happening in this country., 8 If we follow the examples of cities like Chicago and D.C., every community would have effective, common sense gun laws., 8 It has come to this:\nWe must ask politicians and gun lobby powers how they would respond if THEIR children or grandchildren were slaughtered.\nAsk Donald J. Trump.\nWe must demand that they answer on the record.\nUnless these deaths become personal, the hypocritical statements of sympathy and their zombie absence of compassion will continue.\nEven when asked the question, history suggests answers won't be forthcoming. Money and power will surely continue to be rated\nabove human life.\nEvil counts on the cries for common sense and decency to fade away.\nThat's why they repeat: The time has not yet come.\nSo -- When will the time have come?\nMr. Gibson's son will be joined by many others before students' and parents' cries are heard -- through massive demonstrations and marches to the polls.\nDoug Giebel, Big Sandy, Montana, 8 Politicians should be made to see the crime scene photos from Columbine, Newtown, Aurora, Pulse, Las Vegas, Parkland. They should hear the names of every dead child and adult. Maybe the public should see the photos too. We cannot let ourselves become numb to the devastation caused by easy access to guns in America.\n\nMaybe we need a Million Survivors March. There must be tens of millions of people whose lives have been affected by gun violence.\n\nMaybe we need peaceful civil disobedience. Occupy the offices of politicians who don't support gun control. Block the entrance to the NRA. \n\nMaybe the remarkably poised teenagers who survived Thursday's shooting will be catalysts for change. They have grown up with school shootings and active shooter drills. Maybe they will lead a movement that will elect gun control supporters. Because  they won't want to worry every day if their children will come home., 8 Mr. Gibson, just as Alexander Gardner published his photos of Antietam to bring home the reality of a Civil War battlefield, it is time to publish mass shooting crime scene photos to bring home the reality of what President Trump and the NRA's GOP lackeys in congress are willing tolerate in our schools, churches, and parks. \n\nThe time has come to use the photos., 8 We failed those children now dead, and those touched by those deaths.  We fail those children who will in the future be murdered because we continue to elect and support people who choose not to stem the flow of blood.  Their blood is on the hands of every one of us who does not demand sensible gun control. , 8 I have an ungenerous observation of human (at least these humans) nature.\nMisery loves company and these people are at the forefront of rewriting our nation's gun laws.  And the mass murders keep increasing., 8 It's about time that members of the Senate such as Rob Portman of Ohio stop accepting funds from the NRA. The NRA is an evil organization which promotes gun ownership and concomitant gun violence. There is absolutely no reason for any citizen to own or carry an assault type weapon such as an AR-15., 8 How devastating and wise to take issue not only with the (ridiculous) issue of gun deaths, but with the popular discourse surrounding it, and particularly the peculiar voyeurism aimed at the bereaved. Reporters ask how you feel, sir, because if you show your grief, then those of us in the audience don\u2019t have to feel it ourselves. Poor man, we can say, maybe tear up, and move on. Whereas the human heart already willing to try to imagine that kind of loss would say, My goodness, sir, you don\u2019t have to tell me anything at all\u2014except how to march alongside you. Enough. Enough., 9 Like another commenter here I noticed the slap at President Obama. I guess Maureen Dowd has forgotten that the GOP vowed to obstruct everything that he tried to do, and were pretty successful at it. I always wonder what the public would have done if Obama , 9 Until the children as collateral damage states, like Florida and Texas, act to stop the gun inspired tragedies, nothing will happen. It's up to them. They have to be the force to stop the carnage., 9 Maybe we should start celebrating mass shootings...like extra points for body counts. The backlash outrage would be huge...then we respond back with \"Where is your same outrage for the people lives destroyed by guns\"?, 9 \"When gun violence becomes commodified as content by the media, we consume it rather than experience it.\"\n\nThat is quote from a NYT article (\"The club no one wants to join\"), written by someone who has lost two family members to gun violence. And it perfectly describes this piece by M.Dowd and all it's self-congratulatory links (\"I wrote about this; I wrote about that\"...very Trumpian, by the way, right down to the Obama bashing).\n\nThere are times when writing about something does nothing to change it. This is one of those pieces. \n\nYou know what kind of piece I want to see?\n\nOne that tells people to go home, turn off the TV and news for a day, and reflect. And then, rather than speaking out \u2014 go do something to change things. For the media, stop writing about it. It does nothing! Go out, and make change happen. Write something that turns a gun owner into a gun opponent. Write ANYTHING but this kind of content that simply rehashes what people already know.\n\nThank you., 9 Jesus, I miss Obama.  Trump, with that grimace and obscene thumbs-up gesture is a disgraceful and disgusting insult to every family member of the slaughtered.  I am so sorry for their loss, and offended on their behalf.\n  I will never offer thoughts and prayers, I WILL offer my vow to work, and vote.  Please join me., 9 Very soft on Trump. Still in love with him. Republicans are really despicable. , 9 I predict that it will take 3 mass school shootings this year before the media will hound Ryan, McConnell, Ernst, Cruz, Rubio and the rest of that idiotic mindset to the point that no other questions get asked until gun control is addressed.  Paul Ryan allowed a bill to go through the House just after the Las Vegas massacre that would allow a 19 year-old in Florida who could get a concealed gun permit to exercise that right in my strict gun control state.  Silencers and armor-piercing ammo were held back until the mood of the country quieted down.  The gun nuts have stifled a national data base and current technology that could identify the source of every bullet fired, the owner of every gun, mandatory locking mechanisms, etc.  In the year 2018 they are afraid that a tyrannical government will locate and seize the 300,000,000 guns out there in a midnight raid so that Clyde Bundy and friends won't be able to take their country back. That is the profound idiocy of a very small tail wagging one big dog., 9 Far be it from me to tell people how to spend their money but if I were a multi-billionaire I'd go to every member of Congrerss who takes money from the NRA and double what they give them with the iron-clad proviso that within 6 months they come up with a comprehensive gun ban or they have to give back the money.  Being the high-end prostitutes they are they'll take the money, we'll get something accomplished and the NRA can go pound salt., 9 President Hillary Clinton would have done something about our country's obscene gun laws (and imagine what sales would have been like in the weeks following her election). Perhaps this is why this is the rare instance when she is not mentioned in a Maureen Dowd column. , 9 Maybe, just maybe, if the NYT, Washington Post, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, WSJ -- in fact, every major newspaper in the USA -- published on page one every day the photos, names, and ages of all the people shot up in the USA, maybe some meaningful gun control legislation would take place.  It's too easy to hide the victims' faces.  Publish them EVERY DAY until something is done.  We are the crazies.  I am glad I don't live in the USA any more, and it is totally embarrassing to try and explain our lax attitude on guns, shootings, and death to people all over the world.  They just don't understand.  Neither do I. I repeat, we (Americans) are the crazies., 9 The satirical \"news\" source, \"The Onion,\" has said most of what needs to be said on this subject.\n\nAll they have to do is to periodically update the details of time and place,\n\nto this:\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-t...\n\nfrom this:\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-t...\n\nfrom this:\n\nhttps://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-t...\n\nAd infinitum., 9 Dowd plays to the crowd.  President Obama had sense enough to understand that nothing on gun control was going to get through a Republican House and filibustering Senate.  Obama had 90% of the people?  Note to Maureen:  Republicans don't care about Representative government!  Got that!?, 9 Perhaps our elected officials, who feel so strongly in the 2nd amendment, should remove all metal detectors from State and Federal buildings, as a show of continued support for the right to bear arms.....   We can then offer thoughts and prayers for their safety in the workplace! , 9 Ms. Dowd, please tell us why the US is the only first world country with these kinds of shooting statistics., 9 One angry Florida constituent tweeted out Mario Rubio after one of his latest platitude filled statements following the murder of 17 people in Parkland Florida, reminding him of the 3 plus million backsheesh he received from the NRA.\nNothing seems to move congress, the grip of the oligarchy and the NRA has defeated us. I began to wonder then, how would Senator Rubio feel if this tragedy was visited on his precious family. If this thought does not move a purchased senator, what in God's green earth will? What hope is there?\nhttps://heavy.com/news/2016/02/marco-rubio-children-kids-how-old-are-age..., 9 One of your best, Ms. Dowd. Thank you., 9 Military Type (MT) weapons are designed for only - one - purpose, to kill as many people as possible in the shortest period of time ! Here in America, Manufacturers of MT weapons are 'Merchants of Death', the NRA \"leaders\" are their marketers, the politician enablers aid and abet dread, terror and - murder - nationwide. In addition, there is tacit support for this epidemic disease from the White House, our 'Moscow on the Potomac\". A sage once said; \"Everybody has a price.\" I am not totally certain that is true! However, considering a solution, I cannot conceive of any humans involved in this whole disaster proclaiming their mission in life/business/politics is to slaughter as many men, women, and children as possible, although that is the actual \"collateral damage\". If I am correct, the only motivation for these \"humans\" has to be \"their price\" - money - as disgusting, amoral as that is. Therefore, the solution is to remove the money motive by making MT weapons and their possession illegal and subject to severe penalties. The only way that can happen in our \"Democracy\" is action by \"our\" politicians who are loathed to losing \"their price\", NRA money. Ergo, we must replace those politicians in the next election with moral, intelligent, responsible Representatives and Senators . If we, you and I, don't accomplish this vital assignment then we cannot complain, but just learn to live with the continued slaughter. It's that simple!, 9 I think the tragic irony of the Parkland school shooter is that he arrived at his murdering ground by Uber.\n\nIn other words, he was able to legally obtain an assault rifle and enough ammunition for a holocaust, but may not have been allowed to drive., 9 There is only one answer: Nov 6, 2018, 9 The country is polarized on this, as on so many issues . . . 'gun-culture' USA is  clearly willing to accept regular gun massacres in return for the right to own as many guns as they like. Areas outside 'gun-culture' USA only want an exemption from the manic zealotry of the NRA. That's all . . . just allow us to impose state and local limitations that fit our preferences. Of course, 'gun-culture' USA can't be content until everybody is armed to the teeth.\n\nThe final irony is that I believe that the majority of gun violence is suffered by the residents of 'gun culture' USA. Even in Sandy Hook, the home of the NRA-like National Shooting Sports Foundation. By definition, gun suicides --one of the most common causes of death for adult, white males in the US-- happens only in 'gun culture' homes. They don't want to be stopped. They stupidly believe that they and their children are exempt from statistics. \n\nI've been called every vile name you can think of by relatives that live in 'gun culture' USA for pointing out simple statistics. I've reached the point where I honestly can't care that they are massacring their families and neighbors except for their insistence that my community conform to their norms. You really can't cure stupid., 9 Our president's absurd gun crime focus, of course, is MS-13 - something he can do to stir up his anti-immigrant, gun touting base. Even though it turns out that more people were killed in ten minutes by the white, non Hispanic, middle aged man in Las Vegas than have been killed by MS 13 in our country.  , 9 If only there were more mass killings at country clubs. Either people would then care, or at least there\u2019s would be less of those guys. And btw, murder is a state crime, not the biz of the fbi. This ones on you gov Scott. , 9 Maureen, this is the best thing you\u2019ve ever written. Powerfully on point. \n\n\u201cWhen societies try to protect a malevolent status quo, they become warped.\u201d, 9 unlike the hollwood and church matters, we have  an objective, protect kids, that does not require the complexities of making new law or navigating \"cultural change\"...and we also have simple means, \"harden the targets\" as security pros say, fix insecure entrances, control, totally, coming and going and add the necessary personnel, armed and on station....once that's done, let the blather resume....blame the silent hollywood a-list for abetting harvey et al., and, by all means, blame trump for no-go gun control (of course he failed and in typical oh-do-crude-and boastful belly-flop fashion, as opposed to obama who failed with a degree of elegance, while he was in his bubble grading papers and clinton who good-old-boy failed because he was, likely, otherwise engaged, so to speak.\n\nwe can do this overnight, failure here (and responsibility for the next shooing) lies with all of us., 9 Americans like guns. That needs to end, if things are to change. If you own a gun - yes, even to shoot at bottles on a wall - you are part of the problem. The number of guns in a country is directly correlated to the number killed by guns each year. The gun was part of America's Ur myth, the foundation story. Now it's time to grow past that., 9 To the extent that we (America) tolerate personal possession of weapons of mass destruction to continue, we are complicit in every such massacre.  NRA friends tell me one can murder with a screw driver so must we make screw drivers illegal?  Such a devious argument.  Over-eating also kills.  And over-drinking.  And over-anything.  So outlaw everything?  How many massacres have been inflicted with screwdrivers or with excesses of french fries?  Guns are intended to kill.  Why has the right to kill, to kill virtually anything we desire to kill at the moment, become such a perfidious use of the second amendment in this land that once was described as a \"city set on a hill?\", 9 So you cloth this column in outrage over gun violence, yet mask its real intent to slap Obama about the side of the head, till the middle of the column. What is it with you? The culprit in this national tragedy is the Republican Party pimping for the NRA, and you, with your pathological hate for the most decent man to occupy the White House in decades, forfeit the moral high ground to send a jab his way. You should probably forfeit this space and give a more responsible writer the opportunity; or better yet take over to Fox!, 9 \u201cI wrote in disgust about President Barack Obama failing to... push through gun control\u201d. As if President Obama was the problem.\n\nThe dilusional hubris of Maureen Dowd! The woman who referred to the President as \u201cBarry\u201d for a decade. The columnist who earns a living by writing about her disgust for EVERYTHING, all the time. Except her conservative brother, and her saintly daddy.\n\nMaurie: Your disgust means exactly nothing. Find a mirror. Contemplate what you see.\n\nAnd while you\u2019re at it, consider turning in your pen in favor of essayists who can write a cogent on-point op ed piece that doesn\u2019t pull current news and trends together into a hot mess of \u201cdisgust\u201d., 9 The hysterical leftists like Dowd, Blow and their ilk will not stop until the law abiding citizens are disarmed and only those intent on killing innocents, have guns. We have a President who believes un the sacred second amendment, the precious civil right afforded to us by our founding fathers. The \"people\" have that right , not only militias as the illiterate radicals who never diagramed a sentence tell us, andithat right shall not be infringed. That is in bedrock. Congress must pass conceal carry reciprocity immediately. If gunmen know teachers are armed, those who are afraid to die like Nick Cruz,  will stay away. , 9 Maybe you could have really done something about gun control, but no Maureen, you chose to bloviate about how bad \"Barry\" was doing as  president.  How does \"Barry\" look now, Maureen?, 9 First of all there is no use in expecting Trump to follow through on anything he says.  He is an ignorant, soulless being as we all know. And his chief advisors are scary - especially Stephen Miller, the born again Nazi.\nBut I digress.  The real criminals here are the greed driven gun manufacturers and their highly paid, well connected, lobbyists who funnel tons of money through the NRA and conservative PACs to GOP Congress members who do their bidding.\nThe real light in this darkness is the students from Florida who have spontaneously and immediately spoken out and protested about the real issue - guns.  They get it!  They are not diffusing the issue with all the lesser causes. What intelligence and courage they have!  And they are are lifting up the issue and the outrage to the entire nation!  Good on them.  And may it be sustained in the coming national protests in March and April and in between and after until The AR -15 is banned and gun restrictions are federally, not state, mandated.\nChildren have historically been collateral damage in the game of power and money. Think of the children in Syria and the millions of children killed in the Holocaust. Now it is our own government that is the perpetrator. Only the uprising of the citizens of our country against the powers that be will effect permanent change.\nLet's stand up for our children and not let them be slaughtered anymore!, 9 America is in the throes of great disruptions and anxieties, as we sort out our values and our future. But it doesn\u2019t take any soul searching to know this: Treating children as collateral damage is intolerable.\n---------------------------------------------\nStop being so maudlin, Mo. You should be better than that.\n\nThe massacre had nothing to do with NRA or guns. It had everything to do with FBI failing to do its job when it was tipped off TWICE within a year about this maniac, one tip coming as late as a month before the tragedy.\n\nGet real., 9 The shooter in Florida is not mentally ill he is a domestic terrorist., 9 The president tweeted the FBI missed the Valentine Massacre because they are wasting time trying to prove collusion between him and Russia.  He goes Al Capone after a week like this?  Does he have syphilis, too?, 9 Forget about Trump. There are godless monsters afoot in our society and their letters are NRA. The effective murderers of children. They should rot in prison., 9 \"But we didn\u2019t care.\"\n*************\nI disagree.  We cared very much about stopping Obamacare and tried over 50+ times to do it, and \"those people\" who think everyone should have medical insurance stopped the bill from passing.\nI disagree.  We cared very much about passing a tax cut that, in spite of the small amount the middle class and the working poor would get, was an economic boon to corporations and the very wealthy.\nI disagree.  We cared enough to trample as many regulations as possible, making it easier to pollute or water, air and earth and for the mentally ill to purchase AK-15's.\nThose are the important things.  Why on earth should we care about gun control just because some children might be harmed?, 9 Amen. , 9 If you meet these people and talk to them, or see their posts in social media, you quickly realize that semi-automatic rifles are worshiped and have become a fetish for them. It is a growing sick religion identified by the SPLC in their index of hate groups. The massacres in Las Vegas, Sandy Hook and now Parkland are just acceptable losses to these groups in their slavish worship of guns. When you try to limit the guns, you are treading on their god., 9 Don't let the BRA hunker down.  Put \"The NRA refused to comment\" in every article about these murders.  This is your responsibility., 9 Go Maureen! , 9 Ah but how much does America care?  Even if Trump, himself,was behind  that AR15 in Parkland, Florida, the base would look the . other way. Because they only care about getting rid of immigrants and taking food stamps and health insurance from the poor. They see America going to hell in a hand basket. At their expense.  A few gun victims along the way isn't going to get in the way of Making America Great Again.  Remember Mr Cruz was filmed shooting a pellet gun in his back yard.  With a Make America Great Again hat on.  He's one of them.  They need to have his back.  \"He could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and not lose a vote\"  So what's a little school shooting in Parkland, Florida?  Surely not worth any votes.  , 9 Trump's god is a heathen hedonist pagan named Putin who helped him get elected President.  So that Trump can profit from his office while hiding his personal and family income tax returns and business records from the American people and spending a third of his time in office on vacation at Trump properties at American taxpayer expense. \n\nThe House of Trump is an Barbarian Organized Crime family.  No member of the Trump family has ever volunteered to pull the trigger of any American military gun while wearing the military uniform of an American armed force. Don, Jr. and Eric pretend to be hunters. But both boys are shooters at best and poachers at worst, 9 The GOP is full of idiots who have been brainwashed into thinking that the 2nd Amendment actually means that we all get guns. The Second Amendment has nothing to do with us all owning guns, yet that is how the Supreme Court has chosen to interpret it and that is what the GOP chooses to believe. It is insane. \n\nTrump has criticized Chicago for being violent, yet seventeen people were not killed in a school in Chicago last week. The GOP has allowed the entire country to become a ghetto, yet the GOP criticizes inner cities. , 9 Without the deplorable  gun nuts, deplorable neo-nazis, deplorable bigots and deplorably ignorant voters there would be little left of today's Republican party. That's their base and if children die because of it they don't care. Tax cuts for the rich are what gets their attention.\n\nWe all remember your disillusion with Obama too well. LBJ operated in the 1960s with a majority. Oh, and he was white too. Did you upbraid Boehner, Ryan, O'Connell, The NRA for the slaughter then ? Did you speak out when Republicans swore to make him a one term president ? No, you wanted him to schmooze with the cowards, drink a beer, hang out with hypocrites.\n\nIt doesn't matter now. What you can do now is use your considerable skill to call out these cowards, relentlessly. , 9 written by a woman that claimed her moron father took her ten year old brother to an expected gun fight in Herald Harbor MD, 9 I'm encouraged at the idea of a nationwide walkout this Spring. Another assault weapon ban and universal background checks are possible next January after we've cleaned the stable a bit. #BlueWave2018, 9 I really dislike the Obama bashing as he really tried to pass gun legislation after the Sandy Hook massacre!  The clown in the White House went to Florida and gave his customary smirk and a thumbs-up sign while talking to the police!  The Republicans have blood all over them as does the NRA!, 9 Ms Dowd you have articulated a situation that has been rolling around in my mind for years: what social dynamics are playing out in an institution that permit systematic wrongdoing to go on, with everyone knowing what is going on, and yet, no one in a leadership role steps in to stop the behavior. Putting Trump's broken moral compass aside, you can't tell me that Paul Ryan or even Mitch McConnell don't wince a bit when they see these mass shootings unfold in the media. When they do talk, it is like watching individuals suffering from the stockholm syndrome, where, no matter how bad the massacre, they are incapable of identifying the cause and incapable of any sort of action. When you have near 90% of the public identifying not only the problem---too many guns---and possible solutions---background checks, banding of assault weapons---and yet all our leadership is capable of doing is to pray and say, with a straight face, \"it is too early to talk about guns,\" wow, you wonder, what kind of silos to these people live in and how did they get there. , 9 I have never, ever, posted a comment on any web page, in response to any story or in any any other context. This is a first for me. But your piece moved struck a chord. This is, indeed, intolerable. Period. I support the second amendment, but I have come to believe the NRA is simply evil. There is no other explanation. I will do everything in my power, i.e., vote, to counter the NRA's truly immoral influence in Washington., 9 Seems pretty clear that mental illness not properly treated and law enforcement breakdown are the big issues here. It's hard to see how, short of national disarmament, an assault weapon ban is going to do anything except gratify virtue-signallers and issue fetishists.  There are simpler measures that can be taken, and which are known to work. Install metal detectors in all high schools, just as in government buildings, with police or armed security guards to man them. Sure it is worth the cost. And raise the age for purchasing guns or certain kinds of guns. , 9 In 1964, Joe Pyne said the government is coming to take my guns. Anyone know when that's supposed to happen? I'm tired of worrying about this. , 9 We are all collateral damage to the quest for profit.  , 9 This may be the best column you have ever written.  Please keep your laser focus on this., 9 Money in politics.  Repeal Citizens United.  Take away the money, then you take away the stranglehold the NRA, the Kochs and the Christian Dominionists have on this country.  And you wouldn't have old-world, white privilege (& supremacy) perverting SCt decisions that allow teenagers to access weapons that had nothing to do with the 2nd Amendment when it was passed., 9 Trump has turned America's clean water, clean air, children's safety at school, immigrant dreamers, social safety net, courts of substantial justice in accordance with law, and crumbling infastructure into collateral damage.  But the media which makes money marketing right wing claptrap cannot take their eyes off of the money.  America used to nominate respected federal judges for political office.  Where is a 50-59 year old experienced federal trial judge with a solid reputation for fairness (in NY, there are some), who is used to cross-examination that separates the false and misleading from the accurate, who will stand up and say \"enough.\"  , 9 The only thing you hear from many Republicans after yet another mass shooting, is that \"their thoughts and prayers\" are with the victims and their families. Well, that certainly makes it all better.\nMaureen you have it right. These guys have literally sold their souls to the NRA that hides behind the second amendment to justify the sale of assault weapons while our children are slaughtered., 9 In today's society, it would be prudent to marshal social media to combat guns and the NRA.  America does change.  Think about driving while drunk.  That campaign worked even if it takes decades to win.  Think about how much faster we could change minds with social media beating the drum again the NRA.  In those messages, we need to make guns and the violence that they perform as local to the person reading it.  People may like the NRA and guns but if we can make them think about the \"what if\" of your child being killed.  It just might work., 9 \u201cSince Newtown, there have been more than 1,600 mass shootings. Each time, the outrage seems to fade faster.\u201d\n\nAbout says it all.\n\nWell almost. \n\nYou did add this regarding Sandy Hook: \u201cIf the sight of slaughtered angels did not dent the nation\u2019s conscience, could anything?\n\nEach time this random terror happens the absolutely gruesome reality of the slaughter, the grave wounding, the images of children mangled, or for that matter concert goers or nightclub patrons, is largely repressed in the media coverage. \n\nWe hear of the profound grief of parents or friends, or spouses, of the shock and disbelief, of the personal horror of terrible random loss. \n\nBut the real carnage, the searing images of rented flesh, of blood letting, and wanton slaughter remain almost entirely hidden.\n\nMay be what is needed is to see fully into the carnage behind the routine and so often repeated coverage with the safer images that are so much easier to set aside., 9 Treating ANYONE as collateral damage is intolerable, but American history is replete with carnage: Indians, slaves, women, child labor, immigrants, McCarthy's \"communists,\" gratuitous wars.\n\nFor the NRA, no lives matter. \n\nIf we really want to change, the best place to start is\nto simply look in the mirror. , 9 Saying that this slaughter of children is intolerable is only the first step -- the next step of actual \"action\" is the only one that matters, 9 Excellent commentary, thank you. It is just infathomable that our country's leaders accept the slaughter of our own children, for any reason., 9 Let\u2019s put it this way:  I wish my grandkids went to school in Japan.\n\nDonald Trump could probably never guess why I write that. , 9 The law abiding citizen continues to be one up until he does not.  Mr. Cruz was within his American rights until he stepped inside the school, and started firing. Even if the FBI made a visit to the perpetrator, what crime would he be charged with?  Law abiding is a straw man, a play on words, and an invalid concept as to whether gun owners are a menace to society or not.  The rest of the civilized world thinks they are.  We're a bit slow on the uptake., 9 \"Then I gave up.\" Quite an admission on your part, and many other journalists who gave up and went on to other topics. The NRA did not give up. And still have not. And the journalists who remain, and ever American citizen, cannot give up; we must double down and we must vote. Let us hope that this growing energy remains committed to reclaiming this Democracy. Start by not re-electing any member of Congress with an A-C rating from the NRA. Perhaps then they will get the message. , 9 I have no quarrel with anything Ms. Dowd has said in her column or for the most part how it is written.  She takes issue with the actions of, President Trump, President Obama, the National Rifle Association ant the Roman Catholic Church (among others).  No problem.  And, then she refers to the film producer Harvey Weinstein using the noun \"MOCHER.\"  \"\n\nMOCHER is a Yiddish word, which describes someone who gets things done or In its derogatory meaning \"an overbearing person.\"  Yiddish is a language that is almost universally spoken by Jewish people.  Mr. Weinstein' s actions were deplorable as ate some of the actions of Mr. Trump, the NRA and the Catholic Church.  All could be called \"mochers.\"  Mr.  Weinstein is Jewish but his horrid behavior is unrelated to his ethnicity\nAbusers of women are of all ethnicities.  Ms.  Dowd knows that but some folks who read het column might get the wrong idea.  She should be more careful., 9 It is too soon to talk about so called \"gun control.\" Let's not politicize this tragedy. Guns do not kill people. People kill people., 9 Wisdom from a Douglas High School sophomore named Sarah Chadwick, who informed the President of the United States, via his favorite medium, in words that quickly went viral, \u201cI don\u2019t want your condolences you -ucking piece of -hit, my friends and teachers were shot.\u201d \n\nGod bless the survivors at Douglas High School and all of America's children., 9 Modo cannot help but take a swipe at PBO. Remember, it was the Republican filibuster that killed the background check bill pushed by Obama. As long as the media is stuck in bothsiderism, too many Americans will believe that both parties are to blame; they are not. The NRA owns the Republican Party, and the only way we will ever see some common sense gun safety regulations are to throw the Republicans to the curb. Vote For the Democrats in 2018., 9 Ms. Dowd rightly expresses the outrage we should all feel on the senseless mass killings, particularly in schools, something must done.  The commenters on her essay show why nothing can get done.  The usual liberal nonsense is  trotted out. The NRA, Republicans are to blame. There has been 18 school shootings since the beginning of the year but that is not true. AR-15 are not military assault rifles, the second amendment allows people to have only muskets.  Ms. Dowd rightly points out that Obama had a Democratic Senate it failed to pass any legislation after Newtown.   This a hard thing to change.  It is most likely that the second amendment will not be repealed or that the government will confiscate weapons. Feel good legislation like banning so-called assault weapons is unlikely to have much effect.  I believe that the best approach would be a pro-active screening for anyone possessing, purchasing semi-automatic weapons.  You would have to prove you were sane, submit to a psychological screening to possess these high powered firearms.  This screening process would happen at the time of purchase and be repeated every few years.  This would be hard to do, for example, would you permanently  ban people who had depression at some point in their lives?  However, in almost all the mass shootings, the perpetrator was known to have mental illness and in many cases was under active care.  I realize this would be a very invasive process, but the mental ill cannot have these weapons. , 9 Imagine the congressional and executive right trying to weigh what is more important in terms of weapons reform laws: Guns and money or our children, Guns and money or our children, Guns and money or our children. The winner: MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After all we have lots of children, more than enough to go around and to top it off they can be quite costly. \n\nYes, a rather sick outlook, maybe even demented, but no less so than the inability of politicians to actually deal with the real issue. If weapons of death actually contributed to safety then given the amount of guns in this country, we should be the safest place on earth. Not even close!, 9 keep it up maureen. we must get control of the NRA and its stooges in Congress. australia should be our model. get military\nweapons out of the hands of the public.\na lifetime hunter that never saw an ar-15 in the woods., 9 Professor Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame, whose academic specialties includes gun crime, one said: \"an honest assessment of a situation [is that] the cat got out of the bag 100 years ago, and there's just no putting that cat back in.\"   I think maybe our more fundamental issue isn't bump stocks or magazine sizes - although those should be addressed.  The bulk of killings are by someone the victim knows and using a handgun.  Melt down all the AR15s, sure.  But that's not going to make an appreciable difference in the 30K gun deaths (let alone woundings) each year in our country., 9 This is not a Trump issue. It\u2019s not a Republican issue. It\u2019s our issue, and it\u2019s our fault not enough has changed. Ranting on about the government and the second amendment is pointless. Congress is ineffective. If you want change, focus on your local laws and representatives, where you can have an impact. Protest at stores that sell bullets and guns. Publish the names of community members in the NRA \u2014 name and shame. Don\u2019t agree with your representatives? Run yourself. Send money to anti-gun advocates in gun owning states. But to continue to sit here, writing and whining and hoping for some grand somebody else to do something is futile. , 9 It seems that the commentator moderators don't like my perspective on the many op-eds about this issue, as they are not publishing them. I'll try one more time:\nAmerican society is ill. It has become addicted to violence and carnage and, like an alcoholic, the society refuses to admit it has a problem. It seems that you all have ceded your personal safety and sanity to a minority of folk who insist that it's there \"god-given\" right to own incredibly deadly weapons and nothing else matters.\nHow you can't see the reality right in front of you is incredibly disturbing. How many of you must die in order for you to wake up?, 9 I'm heartened by the righteous anger I'm seeing on the part of surviving Parkland students, and I hope this gets extrapolated to all high school students in the coming months.  Many of them will vote for the first time in November and it looks like they are ready to take that anger to the voting booth.\n\nBut we should all be ashamed that the children have had to pick up the ball that we keep dropping.  It's our job to protect them, not the other way around., 9 No where do you mention Paul Ryan's flippant\nstatement condemning any criticism concerning\nGun control as \"knee-jerk\" action after school\nshootings. Rubio's statement was similarly muted.\nBut you slyly crafted a major zing (as usual) at\nPresident Obama. We will have our retort in November., 9 The gun rights advocates have the upper hand, that is clear. To get something one will need to accept that something else will need to be given. Gun control advocates can forget about repealing the 2nd Amendment, registration, banning assault weapons, etc., but some other things could be on table. One thing that gun control advocates want is a 50 state concealed carry permit, and the ability to carry firearms safely through states in the US without threat of legal action. There is lot of trading that could take place here. \n\nSomething that I would prefer to see is including certain magazine fed semi-automatic rifles as NFA weapons, but that would require increasing the size of the ATF due to the volume of weapons. I don\u2019t think it would pass favor it does involve registration, even though that could be encrypted with two keys, one held perhaps by a non-government agency.  Handguns were originally supposed to be included in the NFA of 1934, that they weren't was the biggest criminal justice blunder in history of the US. Let us hope we aren't doing the same with magazine fed semi-automatic rifles. , 9 True, all true, but tell it to the NRA and the GOP., 9 What happened to \"a well-regulated militia\"?\nWhat is so complicated about banning military-style weapons and punishing those who manufacture and/or sell them? , 9 We have come a long way with technology bettering almost everything.  Including guns.  Who believes any of the founding fathers of our nation or composers of the constitution envisioned the advance of the arms industry?  Why is it permissible for ANYONE to be able to buy ANY of the weapons today and massacre innocent children who are our future?\nThe second amendment specifically says the right to bear arms is for a militia not every demented person or any person to bear arms.\nShame on those legislators who sold their souls to the NRA. , 9 Maureen, I do worry, in searching every highway and byway for answers and understanding, if in anyway these children are being groomed to commit these terrible acts, like suicide bombers in other countries?  Something is not right!  , 9 The USA was always a rough, rugged place, violence was always a factor in the nation's character, but we did not countenance the killing of innocents. That is what we are doing, inaction speaks loudly that we value an AR-15 more than a young life.\nDoing away with them won't stop gun violence, there are already far too many of them in circulation, but a ban stops the fresh supply and over time such atrocities as happened this past week will end., 9 I completely understand the impulse to surrender. I wrote this myself after Las Vegas at the Tikkun Daily Blog. Yet, this time the young people and their parents in Florida are not lighting candles and leaving shrines with stuffed animals. They are protesting, demanding gun control legislation.\n\nThis is the hope.\n\nSo, we have no choice but to take a deep breath and continue the fight for gun regulations.\n\nDo not vote for anyone who has or who does or who will take money from the NRA., 9 We need to redefine mentally ill people. In the next DSM there should be categories for people who buy or want to buy various kinds of guns. It is our most lethal addiction., 9 Don't vote for any politician--local, state, national--who accepts money or other support from the NRL...Period!, 9 Millions of permitted gun carrying adults in FL didn't harm anyone yesterday.\nAnd then you have comments like \"until it personally affects you\"...\nTell that to a cop.  If someone in your life was attacked with a gun, it's still the same from then on. Only a gun can protect you in a rural home, or from a crazy with a knife.\nThe school and local officials failed., 9 This NRA sponsored genocide against our country can be stopped cold without taking anyone's guns away.  If a gun is used to kill or injure another human being, one or many, the chain of responsibility and liability runs from the manufacturer on down to everyone who ever owned or sold that that gun.\nThe liability can range from prison time to no less than monetary restitution to the victim(s) and their families.  No excuses, no explanations, no legal defense.  Your name appears in that gun's history, you're complicit.\nThat might not seem reasonable to people, but it isn't reasonable to be gunned down in study hall, either.  Buy and sell all the guns you want.  Feel free to own hundreds, with bump-stocks and all.  No problem with the 2nd Amendment.  No one is coming for your guns.\nBut know that you are responsible, your entire life, because you came in contact with that gun and helped it get to its final destination, wittingly or not.      , 9 I wish we could vote today., 9 ...and, it also happened with slavery in this country, for centuries.  Let us hope it will take less time to face up to the gun problem in the U.S., today., 9 Congress, President Trump:  Show some moral courage. Our children are being gunned down.\nDO SOMETHING!  You are failing our country. , 9 Haiku\n\nWith our \"45\"---\nChildren will be much more safe\nIf all are toting., 9 How about the Democrats giving up their adamant opposition to restrictions on abortion which also kills many that some of us regard as children?\n\nAs long as Democrats continue to defend abortion, their outrage is going to look hypocritical to many of us.\n\nDid you know that France, German, Italy and India all limit elective abortions to 12 weeks?  And yet the Democrats are fighting against a restriction to 20 weeks., 9 Donald Trump is a performer with the largest audience of his career.  Watching his audience, he fis his lines to their expectation of his character. His audience imagines themselves in this actor;  they see a successful businessman, a tough guy, a protector of religion, a man who puts women in their place, a man who takes what he wants.  They get to live his successes instead of their failures, supporting the parts they like, not thinking or caring about the destruction he leaves in his wake.  Trump has no position or belief other than in his own \u201csuccess\u201d. he will not do anything that will harm his image in the view of his admirers, which means he will not do anything other than playing himself., 9 I'd like to know which idiotic court ruled that the phrase \"in a well organized militia\" meant private citizens can have carte blanche ownership of weapons.\n\nRemember this embryonic nation could not afford a large standing army, and had to rely on militia for defense in the 18th century. Well, it is now 2018 and we pay a large standing--well armed--military, extremely well. \n\nGun ownership is one thing. Military weaponry in the hands of civilians is quite another., 9 Of course the only real and lasting solution is to disconnect the NRA and Gun Lobby from elections. By passing Comprehensive Campaign Finance Reform, and publicly funding elections, we can break the hold this fringe group of terrorists hold over our elected officials.\nFinally, what \"Well Regulated Militia\"was the shooter a member of?, 9 There was no such Constitutional \u201cright to bear arms\u201d in this country for nearly two centuries. That changed in 1988 with the Supreme Court decision (Holder) declaring that yes, indeed, there is such a right, something the Founders envisioned when James Madison wrote the 2nd Amendment. The majority decision was written by Antonin Scalia in a 5-4 vote.\n\nWhat many don\u2019t seem to know is that the decision culminated a decades-long PR campaign by the NRA, which was searching for a way to sell more guns by its main benefactors \u2014 gun makers. Bogus \u201cacademic\u201d research paid for by the NRA asserted that the 2nd Amendment DID grant a right for everyone to own guns. The decision was stunning because hardly anyone expert in Constitutional law had ever found such an interpretation. Chief Justice Warren Burger opined that Holder was one of the worst SCOTUS decisions in history.\n\nSo, next time kids are slaughtered in school, or music fans picked off like fish in a barrel, remember two things: they died so more guns could be sold. And Scalia\u2019s fervent protege, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the Court, placed there to protect Holder from being overturned., 9 In Australia all semiautomatic fire arms are banned except for professional hunters of dangerous animals like saltwater crocodiles. Try putting a \"bump-stock\" on your bolt action rifle.   , 9 I own an AR for feral hog eradication in Texas and to keep the coyote population down.  The multi shot capability works well for those chores.  But it was way, way too easy for me to buy--it would be very dangerous in evil or insane hands.  It came with 30 round magazines, but I've switched to 10 as a simple, symbolic act of support for progressive laws.  I think we should pass a four part law immediately--move suppressors (silencers) off the NFA, and move hi capacity magazines onto the NFA.  Then approve concealed carry interstate reciprocity, coupled with a universal background check law.  Those would be good trades, my friends, suppressors and lawful concealed carry are not problems, but the hi capacity magazines and easy access are., 9 \"If the sight of slaughtered angels did not dent the nation\u2019s conscience, could anything?\"\n\nUnfortunately, people don't get religion until it touches them personally.  With a nation as large as ours, many more innocents will be sacrificed to the GOP-NRA Gun Gods before enough of the population are 'touched' by tragedy.  More children will die and some day, enough moneyed politically important people will lose loved ones to cause 'do-nothing' congressmen to enact legislation to counter the madness.  As long as they get a fat donation to buy their vote!, 9 I just donated to GoFundMe for these parents to have the ability to afford a decent burial for their slaughtered children. As a mother of five I can't even begin to imagine the agony they are going through. I support Chris Murphy's campaign even though he is not my senator. I am  a monthly contributor to Sandy Hook promise, an activist group started by the grieving parents of the Sandy Hook victims who were viciously slaughtered in that school shooting.\nI'm enraged that FL Gov scott is attempting to wash his hands of all culpability. he mouths tiresome platitudes about access to mental health care but refused to sign onto the ACA out of racism and petulance directed at Obama. The school seemingly did all that they could to remove this disturbed young man from the premises. His disturbing and alarming behavior was reported to the proper authorities. Yet nothing more was done. No intervention by social workers, by counseling. No background check that would have flagged him as a danger. Why wasn't he in the police data at the least? My husband couldn't get a gun permit in MA to go target shooting with a friend because our 8 year old son, egged on by older boys in our neighborhood who bullied him relentlessly, stole junk mail from an abandoned house. Even with three character references my husband was still denied a permit due to this childhood prank committed by our 8 year old! Yet this young red-flag adult purchased a gun. At least his 2nd amendment rights weren't violated!, 9 Maureen's exasperation has finally put me in the same place. I used to be quick to point out that the Constitution was not a suicide pact. Although not our Founders intention, I now realize that American are now living a suicide pact. Thoughts and prayers can't bring us back from the dead., 9 What is this broad statement \u201cthe community shrugged\u201d or \u201cAmerica shrugs\u201d? Or \u201cwe\u201d can\u2019t summon  up the courage to take on gun control\u201d?  I\u2019m so sick of these massive generalized statement saying \u201cwe\u201dcan\u2019t stop the carnage and  lumping me and so many millions of people together who work for change into the cesspool of the ones who are actually stopping real reform from happening: the sick and twisted NRA, Mitch McConnell, almost EVERY Republican, and a handful of Democrats.  Journalists have a responsibility to name names, call those out, again and again, so they are held accountable for blocking gun violence legislatio.  Stop with the WE generalizing. There is a critical difference between those who care, fight, and back candidates who will take a stand and the Republicans and NRA (and the voters who support them) who are accountable for the continued killings with weapons of mass destruction., 9 \"Trump wrote in his 2000 book, 'The America We Deserve'......\"\n\nCan we please stop pretending that Trump actually writes anything other than vapid, insipid tweets? The man can barely read, much less write., 9 Citizens United and legislators with no moral compass provide perfect cover for the NRA.  You cannot convince me that they believe mass shootings of children is intolerable. Quite the contrary.  , 9 It is happening. The young people of Florida are shaming adults about giving in to the NRA much like my generation shamed adults about supporting the Vietnam War. We were sick of dying, of seeing our generation dying, in a war that made no sense to us. Now teenagers are saying, \u201cEnough, we don\u2019t want to die at school because you adults can\u2019t protect us.\u201d Good for them! I want to see huge protests aimed at shaming politicians who have sold out to the NRA. I want to see Donald Trump shamed for selling out to the NRA. I want to see a blue wave of Democrats who support a ban on military-style assault weapons and introducing reforms like the ones Connecticut enacted. To borrow a chant, \u201cHey, hey, NRA, how many kids did you kill today?\u201d, 9 We Times readers have to get angry that our grandchildren were failed by our Leaders like Gov.Rick Scott here in Florida.Mental health pros failed them,too in a weak evaluation of Mr.Cruz.Local Police failed them and why should parents in that community ever trust them again? We won't hear of a low level FBI person being demoted or worse but they failed,too.You know who cared? A guy in another state who phoned in his concern based on the Cruz You Tube threat post.Don't blame just the NRA and the President. Blame School Boards and Police in nice towns who were not heroes on Valentine afternoon.And it will happen again. If you know of a kid acting very weird,do not hide him or her., 9 its not about  \"our\" school children or even Trump.Its about US politics and the sort of society you are or want. On both counts, there is little room for hope., 9 Thank you, Maureen Dowd, for this. We mustn't give up. We mustn't allow this \"malevolent status quo\" anymore. , 9 I enjoy hunting and target shooting, but lately the ad campaigns by gun makers have sickened me. Example: Attractive women do a survivor-style competition with Springfield\u2019s dubiously name \u201cSaint,\u201d an AR-15 of course.\n\nHow do we get out of this mess? Many gun owners like me are not fetishists, and for us they are tools for rural life. I hope these folk will join me this fall, by punishing all in Congress who take NRA blood money., 9 Wow is your blame misplaced! 90 percent of Americans favor stronger, more restrictive gun laws. I'm sorry that, unlike abortion, gun control has not -yet- become a one-issue concern for voters. With this shooting, that may change. But individual voters have proven powerless to the money of the NRA... and your anger should be directed at no one but Congress., 9 I travel a lot internationally for work and i can tell you that the U.S is seen as a crazed freak show.  Most (not all) of the educated professionals i know dont want their kids to come here for college or for summer internships- now they go to Europe, Canada, Australia.  The U.S is seen as too dangerous, too nuts.  In addition to the tragedy and fear our ludicrously lax gun laws cause to our kids, the fear they cause (and putrid racism that has infected parts of the country) will keep away countless talented undergrad and grad students that would have made untold positive contributions to our country...think Steve Jobs biological father, Sergey Brin and countless others.   We\u2019re slowly destroying ourselves.  It wouldnt surprise me at all if the NRA was getting money from the Russians. Disgusting., 9 Enough talking. ACTION IS NEEDED  Shame on the USA. How can you pretend to teach lessons on democracy when you can't even regulate the sale of firearms to just anyone who wants one.\n\nWhat kind of an example are you giving to the rest of the world?, 9 But collateral damage they are. The world must stop to fix this. How many more? How many more?, 9 Jim of Boston,\n\nI would not care what a woman did with her body if there was not another person involved in that decision.  When you have an abortion, you are terminating a pregnancy.  Of course, you knew  that but obviously do not think it is wrong.  That is a very selfish viewpoint but pro abortion folks do not care about the ending of innocent human life.  Maybe if you had witnessed life or given birth you would see it differently.  Those of us who have children do., 9 And don't forget Scalia and his tortured interpretation of the Second amendment. So much for appointing conservative judges, 9 America shrugs? I\u2019m not sure I agree with that. No one I know thinks this situation is acceptable. The Republican-led Congress, however, has at every tragedy, balked at doing anything more than offering their hypocritical \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d, praying mostly for people to let it go and for the NRA campaign donations to keep on coming.\nHow nice that you\u2019ve had a change of heart, Ms. Dowd, since you did your best to help get this loser elected., 9 And how, my dear Ms. Dowd, should we treat the vengeful and fearful Trump Administration, the sanctimonious NRA, the paid for and professional lobbyists, the silent and clueless Congress, the complicit medias, the oligarchs of support as all of the above regard America as their collateral damage1, 9 In all our wars, children have always been collateral damage. They still are. We are destroying children, and their parents, in Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia, just as we did in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,Nicaragua,  Angola, Congo, and Mozambique. We never see any photos or names of those kids, or the adults who died trying to protect them from our attacks. \n\nThe Times should produce a directory of all the kids worldwide who are killed every day by adult violence. With photos and brief bios. , 9 NRA's chokehold also includes Democrats. The entire Congress is beholden to this organization.  , 9 The ones who are going to change all of this are those who have suffered the most from the carnage, children who have witnessed their friends gunned down by violence.  Those in Congress will not be there forever and memories of these horrid events live forever in the minds of children. The NRA should be very worried about what the future will bring for them when todays youth grow to attain positions of power not only in local, state and federal government but also in businesses and community activism.  Nothing lasts forever and those who will end this madness may not yet be born but it will end, it is all we can hope for today, those that can stop it now have decided it is not in their best interests to do so. , 9 I read your article with interest. I was struck beforehand with the way in which the cult of human sacrifice of the ancient Mayans and Aztecs is perpetuated in the sacrifices of American children and also in the human sacrifices today in Mexico in the ongoing \"war on drugs\" which is played out in present day Mexico as a turf war between dealers. One can only assume after so many sacrifices and complete inaction on any form of gun control that the President of the United States and the Congress are willing participants in the sacrifice of your nations children. , 9 #NationalSchoolWalkout   Maybe this time will be different? The children are taking over. (I am crying inside.), 9 \"she gave up.\"  Maybe she needs to make a sign and march with those school children in Florida.  for as long as it takes..., 9 To my U.S. Senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and my Congressman, Roger Williams: \n\nDo not change our gun laws. Your careers are more important than first grade children dying in a pool of their own blood. Your personal ambition is more important than high school kids murdered before they can get a driver's license. Your legislative success is far more imperative than a parent's pride at their daughter's wedding, their son's college graduation, their only child's tenth birthday.\n\nPriorities, Sirs. Thank you for keeping your jobs in perspective., 9 Ms. Dowd, let's speak frankly.  The GOP is a posse of political prostitutes, although that's not exactly the word I WANT to use.  The top twenty takers of the NRAs literal blood money, in the Senate are GOP.  The number is much greater in the House.  You've mentioned Trumps slavering obedience.\n  How to change this???  Simple.  Money really isn't everything, even in politics.  Voting is what actually counts.  I'm asking readers, and others, to vow to NEVER vote GOP, in any election.  Eventually, they will get the message, or \" retire \".  Speak with your family, neighbors and co-workers.\nVolunteer or donate, if able.  Most importantly:  VOTE.\n   Gun Control OR Dead Children.  CHOOSE.  And choose NOW., 9 Wayne LaPierre is the most powerful person in the United States, and yet you didn't vote for him. When he asks the majority of members of the Senate and the House, \"Who's your daddy?\" they bow their heads and say, \"You are, Wayne.\" Crude statement? Crude imagery? What's crude are the schoolhouse slaughters he facilitates by cowering members of Congress with his cash and threat of political extinction. Of course, they have a choice, now, don't they?; they can't blame LaPierre for their cowardice. He is the man who took the NRA from being a respectable organization that represented gun owners and hunters, the sort of people I grew up with, and usurped the Second Amendment to create a Civilian Arms-Industrial Complex that worships gun profits over life. When I was a teen, you could not buy a switchblade in Pennsylvania; you committed a federal offense if you sawed off a shotgun; and an assault rifle like the AR-15 (the civilian version of an M-16) was something you could carry only if you entered into military service. But LaPierre's NRA changed all of that, and now our schools rather than just foreign battle grounds are where blood flows so tragically from the use of assault rifles. , 9 People who can't live without guns aren't into any kind of negotiation at all., 9 Nothing will ever happen until Americans take to the streets to resist, revolt and also go to the polls to vote the Republicans out of office. This supposedly progressive country is in R drive: Reverse policies, Retrograde gun laws and Regressive old politicians who need to retire and do some soul searching about how we have come to this, elected an incompetent ignoramus, self centered man for President who happens to be Putin's puppet. They also need to reflect on this question: Who is now the adult in the room? The old white gizzard who owes his political career to the NRA or the 17 year old student form Parkland Fl or any town USA who is calling on politicians to stop this carnage?, 9 So: ask Donald J. Trump, politicians who love guns more than human life\nand N.R.A.'s LaPierre: How would you respond if your children or grandchildren were slaughtered?\nDemand that they answer on the record.\nCreate the most awsome marches Donald J. Trump has ever seen.\nYes, our national mass murders are \"intolerable.\"\nSo will be the hypocritical responses and the absence of responses from\nthe intolerable people we keep electing to serve themselves, serve power,\nserve money over common sense, compassion and life itself.\nDoug Giebel, Big Sandy, Montana, 9 It's called our national, cultural, abuse, gun sickness Maureen, suffered by all including the NRA, Donald Trump, whites, blacks, republicans, democrats, males, females and dogs who shoot their owners and pols.\n\nIt is easy to pick on the NRA and Trump, just like when you single out the male in an abusive relationship and not the co dependent female.\n\nYes, gun owners who shoot their neighbors for the simplest of reasons, kill themselves and family members and friends in countless ways suffer from the sickness but so do inner city families who do nothing re children of color killing each other with guns, Hollywood feeding them a steady diet of R rated gun violence films and media like the NYTimes reviewing them as \"brilliant\".\n\nPeople in glass houses don't throw stones Maureen.\n\nThe solution is a policy of legality, regulation, responsibility and non promotion of guns like we had a stunning success with like cig. smoking.\n\nUntil then, as Lincoln taught us, the cure will be elusive., 9 Trump, has surfaced as perhaps the most disgusting part of this entire problem. He has shown his true evil mind with his rollback of the Obama legislation meant to limit the purchase of firearms by the mentally ill. He did this to attack any piece of legislation put in place by Obama. All to satisfy his DEPLORABLE base. Can someone explain to me the logic behind such an illogocal move other political gain by satisfying a vindictive base?\nTrump did this foul deed , knowing full well that this would only bring on more shootings, and more tragedy, but that never enterd his mind. He has demonstrated repeatedly that he cares not one iota for the American citizen.\nThere are many disgusting people involved in this gun control issue. A non caring NRA, politicians with their hands deep in the NRA pockets, gun manufacturers who have refused to heed worthwhile suggestions in the manufacture of these weapons, and a naive population that is frightened over loss of their so-called 2nd ammendment righs.\nNon of thesse individuals however are as vile as the malignant tumor in the White House. He is inept, dysfunctional, and a danger to this nation., 9 So the Trump is tweeting this weekend that it's Obama and the Dems' fault because they did nothing about guns while in office.  Can nobody flip the script on the Trump this time and challenge him with the list of guns laws that were wanted by Dems??  Dare him to act/enact??, 9 Obama tried to get gun legislation passed, but the GOP would never even let a bill out of committee. Yet Ms. Dowd somehow thinks that he shares the blame. After Vegas, there were moves to ban gun stocks. Again, the GOP blocked even that. HRC, for whom Ms.Dowd had such contempt, made the NRA a target of her campaign; Ms. Dowd's friend, Trump, pledged his fealty to the NRA. If Ms. Dowd could have more often gotten past soap opera pop psychology about Obama and the Clintons, and had not bee an early enabler of Trump, I might take her outrage now more seriously. , 9 Why is there no association of victims and victims' families? It could be stronger than the NRA. People need to organize., 9 It is the children themselves that will make the difference that begins with Parkland.  The children are demanding, not asking, demanding to be made safe.  They are raising their voices to demand, not ask, that the adults who have the political power do something.  They are tired of excuses.  They are afraid to go to school.  They don't want to practice 'active shooter' lockdowns, they don't want to leave another school with their hands in the air as if THEY are the shooter (and the shooter left this way!), they don't want to hear the excuses, the mamby-pamby of the likes of a Marco Rubio who whines something must be done, somebody should do something (how about YOU, Sen. Rubio, even after you received 3.3 million dollars from the NRA?), they don't want to walk by the dead bodies of their friends and well-loved adults who tried their best to keep them safe, they are TIRED OF THIS.  \n\nIf we so-called adults in this country cannot keep them safe because our politicians are in the pocket of the NRA.....then god help us.  God help us.  We deserve to die as a country if we allow this to continue.  \n\nTo the children of this country:  I am so sorry we have failed you.  Your terror is my terror and I will do everything I can to change this so that America joins the rest of the civilized world and we fail you no longer., 9 Making horrific threats is not lawbreaking. Social Services workers and even the FBI are not mind readers. To even get a temporary restraining order a physical threat or assault must have occurred. We don\u2019t arrest people on words alone. So we must prevent access to weapons. The school in Florida had a guard who could not react quickly enough to prevent the firing of an automatic weapon. The guard probably didn\u2019t event know of the shooter until too late which with an automatic weapom shooter is minutes and seconds. Are we as a country such cowards to the blackmail of NRA money and grudge voting gun owners that we can\u2019t even limit weapon purchases of bump stock or semi automatic weapons? Can\u2019t the members of the GOP imagine the children killed as if thet were their own? Can\u2019t they see the sacrifice of the teachers killed in Florida who put themselves in the path of bullets to protect children as exemplifying the courage we expect of elected officials? The GOP mainly is a craven heartless bunch completely unworthy of respect or re-election. , 9 Trump is now claiming that were the FBI not so tied up with the Russian election interference investigation, it would not have missed the warnings about the Florida school shooter.  Really??? One can but weep., 9 Good editorial.  Thank you.  My opinion is Obama may have had 90% of Americans on his side, but the NRA had a majority of congressmen.  \"There is little more that Obama could have done on gun control,\" UCLA constitutional law professor Adam Winkler said. \"The president's power is limited, and the NRA wrote the laws to restrict what the executive can do.\" By Joshua Gillin on Friday, January 6th, 2017 at 12:00 a.m. in Politifact, 9 One cannot help but note Republican support for the unborn as opposed to their spineless disregard when children are at risk of being shot and killed in school.  \n\nCan we start with Assault weapons?  \u201cAssault\u201d says it all.  Assault is not about hunting or protecting one\u2019s family and property, it is about killing a large number of people with a military grade weapon.\n\nHow ironic that the Russians are not a weapons threat anymore.  They have figured out we can be defeated in cyberspace  (for a fraction of the cost).  We must do better or our democracy will not survive., 9 \"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\"\n-- Edmund Burke\n\nProblem is, we apparently have very few good men: Good men aren't cowards or greedy pigs; but we have too many of each of these types, our chosen representatives, in Congress -- and a dangerous demagogue in the White House. The moral rot is deep and wide. The cancer has overwhelmed its host, which sooner or later must die or magically get better somehow. Many of us rely on prayer and hopeful thoughts; sustained, focused, effective action is light-years beyond us.\n\nMost of us are painfully aware of the problem. Few of us have a solution, however, because, truth be told, the problem is human nature. Our old misunderstood scriptures made it plain that we have serious built-in ethical issues, like putting ourselves first, last, and in the middle. Good Samaritans are the stuff of myth or legend, by and large. Exceptions, of course, do exist; but they must be few and far between. Most of us are hiding out in our safe places. I know I am.\n\nI know: I'll write my Congressman; he'll know just what to do. Oh, wait, Marco Rubio, my guy, accepted big campaign contributions from the NRA. Well, there's nothing I can do then. (Throws in towel) What does Edmund Burke know anyhow?, 9 Every shooting brings out the piety in us, the thoughts and prayers nonsense that has yet to bring back any of the lost or destroyed lives.  If we truly cared, we'd respond with gun legislation that sticks and works.  Apart from a shotgun or  rifle for those who hunt, there's no need for ordinary citizens to carry any weapon.  As for hunters, I've met many who can't hit their marks.  That would make many hunters armed and dangerous.\n\nA gun is a false sense of security.  Imagine yourself hearing a noise in the middle of the night.  You rouse from slumber still half asleep and start to fumble for that pistol by your bed.  In the dark you try to undo the safety, the adrenalin pumps through your body.  You're scared.  Meanwhile, the perp stands at the foot of your bed with a gun aimed at your head.  Guess who wins this argument?\n\nThere's a formula to owning a gun people forget: You have to be willing to kill another human being and at the same time be willing to die.  Having a gun does not mean you'll win or come out ahead.  Guns are the most anti-life tool known to man.  They have one purpose only, and that is to kill another person.\n\nThen there's this issue of killing another person.  That event alone will mess you up for the rest of your life.  \n\nThe NRA doesn't exist for any of us.  It's there for the manufacturers, for those who profit from gun sales.  The rest of us have been duped.  The NRA is a terrorist organization with the backing of US and state policymakers.  , 9 I live in Canada and I am refusing to visit the USA until they get the guns under control.I hope others will join me., 9 Do you really think the N.R.A. gets all its vast, limitless money from American gun owners?\n\nRecently in this paper columnist Michelle Goldberg suggested that Russia somehow may be significantly funding the N.R.A. Given American political ineptness and dysfunction; given the seemingly bottomless N,R.A. coffers funding Republican re-election coffers; and given the mass-murdering socioeconomic and cultural divisiveness our absurd, inexcusable gun policies encourage; I would not be at all surprised.\n\nDo the math. In a perversely brilliant way, Putin's support of the N.R.A. fits very well., 9 Beautiful article. America can never be \"great again\" while we allow the NRA, and gun lobby to own us., 9 The quiet benefit of the 2nd amendment is the protection freedom loving Americans have from being ruled by a leftist totalitarian regime.  The unfortunate citizens in Venezuela and Iran have no guns to use against the government thugs who rule over them with a total intolerance of  opposition of any kind.  Sometimes the enemy is not a force from another country; the enemy potentially could be an extremist movement within our own country., 9 \"The #MeToo movement has proved that spider webs of protection for predators can be ripped apart in an instant, that unspeakable things that have been tolerated for decades can suddenly be deemed intolerable.\"\n\nI feel that this is what you and your fellow journalists should be speaking to.  We NYT folk know who Trump is.  Inconceivable.\n\nWe don't want to emulate the Fox echo chamber, and we can only do this with the optimism you underline here.\n\nIf each and every one of us could convert just one Trump supporter with facts and examples, what the eyes see ... I pray for a democratic renaissance., 9 @MaureenDowd: that's the best column you've ever written.    You got it exactly right.  It is not about guns or the 2nd amendment or hunting.  It is about recovering our outrage. It is about saving our children. Thank you., 9 We are an adolescent nation.  We will listen to no one and we will pay the price.  Those that voted in this administration are reaping what they sowed and there will be more tragedies.  I fully support a complete walkout of our schools.  I will home school my ten year old if necessary to keep him alive., 9 Its all so pointless and tiresome.  Whenever a call for action needs to be answered on any issue these days issue we go back 25 to 30 years to find someone to blame.  Its Clinton's fault, it W's fault, its Obama's fault.  Can we just live in the present?  Its not rocket science folks.  Either you vote for Candidate A who supports restrictions on semi automatic rifles or you vote for Candidate B who doesn't.  Either you change the GOP controlled Congress that will not act or you keep  the status quo.   We don't need to see another gun study  or hear more fake promises about improving the mental health system.   We have to change the law makers  or accept that these massacres are the price we pay for having a second amendment., 9 As a mental health professional i find it concerning that so many people, including the president, seem to believe the solution to gun violence is to focus on mental health. As if counseling alone would or could stop someone who is antisocial, disconnected, and so damaged that they put their pain into planning and executing a mass shooting. Mental health professionals can identify someone at risk, and they can hospitalize them if and only if they are overtly stating they have such a plan.\nIf a person is deemed high risk,   there should be a law in place that allows counselors to work with law enforcement to have guns removed from the  person and have them flagged for any future purchase attempts.\nThe NRA needs to take a seat and allow lawmakers, law enforcement, the CDC and US citizens to control the gun problem in this country. , 9 We have to have common sense gun control methods now in this country including the banning of assault weapons, background checks on private sales, ban on under 21 year old owning guns, safe storage methods, banning of bump stocks, and research on smart guns. , 9 When Mitt Romney spoke of Trump's candidacy, he called Trump a fraud and a charlatan; that his campaign promises were as good as the \"degrees\" from Trump University.\nThat fraud is nothing compared to the hucksterism and hypocrisy of the NRA.  They have succeeded in advancing the myth that any restriction, however trivial, is equivalent to the repeal of the Second Amendment.  They continue to assert, in the face of history and existing laws, that every citizen has the RIGHT to buy, carry, display and use any firearm at any time in any place of the owner's choosing.\nForget that every amendment of our Bill of Rights is limited and restricted in some fashion.  You cannot yell fire in a crowded theater to assert your 1st amendment rights; you cannot assemble to promote violence (see Charlottesville.) Rights forbidding search and seizure of you and your house/car and double jeopardy, providing assistance of counsel, knowledge of the charges against you, and a jury trial are circumscribed by rules that promote an ordered society.  Indeed, the Supreme Court's Heller decision is notable more for the restrictions it allowed than its limited holding: i.e., you can keep a gun in your home for self defense.\nWhat is missing is the collective political will of all/any politicians at the state and federal level to refuse NRA blood money, reject the false premise that no limits apply to the Second Amendment and fix this scourge.  Connecticut did it and the NRA could not stop it.  , 9 Ducks, geese, and even some deer have better odds than children.\n\nFor years, federal waterfowl law has limited hunters to guns with a maximum capacity of three shells, and this regulation is routinely enforced by game wardens in every state (magazines with a larger capacity must be plugged).\n\nMost states limit the capacity of semiautomatic rifles used to hunt animals to five or six rounds. Maine, for example, bans ownership for hunting any semi-automatic rifle with more than five round capacity has no limit on capacity otherwise (Note: Texas, where the deer are typically the size of small dogs, proudly refuses any limits.)\n\nReason for this limit: fear that bigger magazines would enable unscrupulous hunters to kill more than legally allowed., 9 Most privately owned guns in the U.S. could qualify as assault weapons in that they are firearms capable of rapid fire, which includes semi-automatic and automatic weapons of all types on the high end and even revolvers at the low end. However, semi-auto/auto weapons that accept removable high capacity magazines are the most damaging in mass killings, and these include most pistols and military-style rifles. \n\nThe only serious question about what to do about assault weapons, and one that our society must consider, is whether to amend the constitution to provide a more limited right to private gun ownership. If it is not exactly time for this yet, the carnage that we face as a nation in the future may make that time hasten its arrival.\n\nAnd yes, if a sufficiently limited right to possess and use firearms could be agreed to, there could also be a gun buy-back program (not necessarily confiscation) to help disarm the population accordingly. Australia did this and cut their overall firearms death rate by around 50%. Barring that, and for some weapons anyway, confiscation and criminal penalties might be the only way to rid our society of the most lethal of these weapons.\n\nAt this point, can there really be is such a thing as a responsible gun owner, especially one who supports NRA politics? How responsible can gun owners be who continually vote to keep firearms in the hands of criminals, terrorists, and of otherwise unstable or unsafe people?, 9 There is an undeniable utility to firearms. However that utility is fully served by bolt-action rifles, revolvers, and traditional shotguns. The sophisticated weapons so widely available now to private citizens are the fetish-objects of people with serious control issues. In their violent fantasies the cruel mechanical beauty of their incredibly powerful weaponry enables them to be the masters of the deadly circumstances conjured up in the privacy of their minds. A significant few however are unable to contain their fantasies and they act out their their conviction that deadly force is the most elegant solution to the conflicts that they have come to believe deeply in.\nThe politically active membership of the NRA is best understood as a cult. The leadership of the NRA in D.C. is best understood as a professional for-profit lobbying organization that has become the embodiment of Upton Sinclair's observation that \"it's hard to make a man understand something when his job depends on his not understanding it\". Most disappointingly, the Supreme Court through the combination of it's 2nd amendment and Citizens United decisions has simultaneously rejected its own responsibility to provide a check and balance and destroyed Congress's ability to do the same. It's not the 2nd amendment per se, it's the way it's read. For most of our history it was interpreted as the fundamental law permitting gun control., 9 Assault weapon slaughters are good for gun stock prices. And weapons sales. And increasing the weapons' prices.\nIf we allow the slaughter of perhaps 100 children a month (wait we are doing that already) , maybe a week, then the prices and profits would go up like bit coins did.\nWith that kind of blood money industry lackeys could legislate that every teacher in primary school and secondary school be armed with their own M-4.\nA version that would be fully automatic. Not semi. Good guys need an edge until an unsecured weapon is stolen out of a trunk.\nThe following scarcity of weapons and ammunition would cause profits to further skyrocket.\nAnd perhaps an increased carnage to the tune of 1000 more children  murdered a month.\nIt makes me weep that this scenario is more likely than meaningful gun control legislation., 9 Everything the columnists write, everything the Democratic members of Congress say, everything the country (and especially the family members of the slain and wounded children) wails about, is just \"blah, blah, blah\" because the Republican majority in government has all the power to change things but chooses not to.  Nothing changed after Sandy Hook, bump stocks are still legal, it's easier for the mentally ill to get guns than it was before Trump took office, and the banality of it all is such that this US citizen feels much safer in Montr\u00e9al., 9 Too often the views of ordinary NRA supporters are ignored and all gun policies are attributed to the NRA.  But the common views of gun owners have much to do with our gun policies and require attention.  Most notably, whenever there is a suggestion that gun control advocates will target a particular weapon, a run on that weapon follows.  That tells us that gun owners view themselves as being on the defensive under pressure from gun control advocates who tend to focus on a single piece of hardware at a time.  I believe they view their gun rights as essential and under attack from an unpredictable and irrational public.  Ordinary people trying to protect a basic right from an attack they deem irrational become a force that is difficult to deny.  Ms. Dowd has a lot of big bad wolves that she targets.  But she ignores the real people who are the key to the gun rights movement and the power of the NRA.  , 9 Since cowardly and corrupt Republican politicians--and some Democrats as well-- are so beholden to the alleged power and \"money\" of the evil NRA, us 80 percent of the American electorate (and 100 percent of our children) want more stringent gun ownership laws, then we can demonstrate this by asking each of our representatives one single question:  \"What legislation will you support regarding gun ownership?\"  If you don't like their answer, then say \"I will vote against you.\"  We live in a thriving, vibrant democracy, and when our representatives do not reflect our wishes and aspirations, then we simply--and LOUDLY--vote them out of office., 9 I know longer have the patience to even \"debate\" this issue.  As far as I'm concerned, Congress and the President are either with us, the American people, or they are against us.  As of right now, I think it's obvious whose side they are on, and it isn't we, the people.  , 9 I have heard that there is an effort being made to organize a nation-wide boycott of school by high school students sometime in the upcoming weeks.  I wish them well.  Our adult population, especially the political class, has become utterly morally and ethically bankrupt around the situation.  We are lost in an old paradigm, one that has little utility yet will not die, propped up with the money of vested interests, and the invested egos of so many \"red-blooded\" Americans lost in a fever dream of old Western movies wedded to modern firearm technologies.  Perhaps the kids can teach us something about doing the obviously right thing.  Jesus invoked the natural sense of fairness in children as he exhorted his listeners to developing a more moral life, in his famous \"suffer the children\" teaching (Matthew 18:1-10).  I was quite surprised when my son, as a very young child, showed an astonishing emotional intelligence.  Even as a 5 year old, he could read people quite well (unlike his father).  And the highest compliment he could confer on someone was to say \"Daddy, that man is really nice\".  I hope this high school walk-out happens, and that our children will stand up and shame us all into finally beginning to deconstruct this madness we live in.  And I hope they keep at it in the years ahead.  FWIW, I say this as a life-long gun owner, avid hunter, and non-Christian., 9 \"News\", the parade of events that passing through television screens and read on smartphones, is largely a spectator sport most of the time. It happens somewhere else, to someone else. Like the often deadly police chases across the vast spaces of Los Angeles, news is entertainment. Even as we are deeply horrified by shootings in schools, unless it happens to us or in our neighborhood, there is still a regrettable  entertainment aspect. We feel shock and pain, but it doesn't impact us directly.\n\nWe need more direct contact with what actually happens in these sickening situations. We need to face the awful truth, head on.\n\nThe column states:\n\n\"If the sight of slaughtered angels did not dent the nation\u2019s conscience, could anything?\"\n\nThing is, we didn't see the horror of Sandy Hook. We only saw outside the school, people and mothers crying, a community in agony.\n\nIf we were actually had seen the sight of little children blown apart, it would be different. While the families of those killed would consider this adding to their suffering, it would actually force the nation to understand more completely what is happening again and again.\n\nThis might be possible: use the photos of the aftermath to re-create what happened with mannequins, don't show the actual bodies of children. Put these photos out for all to see and/or in a traveling exhibit. It might be the best thing those parents could do to save others, to shock the nation into awareness that something must be done., 9 This is TERRORism. Those who rail about protecting their corrupt interpretation of the 2nd amendment are as guilty of the carnage unfolding as if arming foreign agents this nation has spent trillions unsuccessfully trying to defend itself against. Democracies, governments, societies do not end because of coup, natural disaster, or similar cataclysmic events. They die because the institutions on which they are built and rely die. And there is no turning back, there is no solution. Vigils, protests, and then back to business as usual. We have neither the will nor stomach for change. The institution of government is too corrupted, too broken, to accomplish anything meaningful other than the fail. And it does, on a daily basis and on every level. This is us. And this is never going to get better. , 9 Treating children as collateral damage is now the standard  We'd like to make them free from gun violence, but how about seeing to it that every child has a doctor, dentist, orthodontist, good public school, etc. Instead we pass a tax cut for the rich and now we have to beg them for donations., 9 Eloquent piece and eloquent comments. But who in power  is even listening? We in India have to get a licence to buy a gun. And getting that licence is difficult, we have to go to police stations and government departments to prove we need one, we have to show specific risk to our lives. In India we have several problems of our own. but mass shootings is thankfully not one of them. The problem in the US is intractable because there are way too many guns out there already, 9 It should (at least) be just like cars and drivers.  Licenses for both.  And no one needs a semi automatic weapon beyond a few rounds to protect themselves., 9 Ms Dowd:\nNot sure where you have been, but trump has been notorious for changing his position willy-nilly.  So quoting his past positions is irrelevant in the fact that he blows in the wind and has always blown in the wind.  trump's motto.\n\"I want what I want when I want it\".  And his wants can change daily with his mood.  No one knows what trump wants from one minute to the next., 9 Obama didn\u2019t succeed in jamming through gun limits after Sandy Hook. The NRA won, but the defeat was both Obama\u2019s and America\u2019s. (LBJ would not have done better. And LBJ gave us Vietnam, the country\u2019s greatest tragedy since the Civil War.), 9 After Sandy Hook with those angels and their teachers, and nothing was done, my belief in good America faded. My tears have followed me through these shootings and today in Florida. Perhaps more so because of being a retired teacher with an educator daughter. \n\n\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\" --Pogo, 9 Just copy Australia's strict gun laws, legislated about 30 years ago under the staunch conservative government of John Howard.  It's not that difficult.  Meanwhile, America will remain a \"sick\" country so long as we don't act., 9 We elected Donald Trump and his $30 million payoff from the N.R.A. And we elected Rick Scoot governor of Florida and $4 million N.R.A. and Marco Rubio as a Florida senator with his $3.3 million N.R.A. payoff where they have the most lax gun laws in the country. Until we stop electing those who refuse to regulate gun ownership and ban weapons like the AR-15, we will continue putting the lives of our children in danger. We all have their blood on our hands, and it's time to show we love them and cleanse sone of the blood away by voting all the gun-loving politicians out of office. They are certainly not serving us but the gun manufacturers and are not protecting our children from weapons no civilian should own., 9 Gun deaths are just the cost of doing business.  Strange that an auto manufacturer cannot produce a vehicle that kills indiscriminately, but gun manufacturers are allowed to do so.  We simply let our politicians make the excuse that the owner/operator is \"mentally ill\" and then blame the FBI.\n\nIt is always someone else fault., 9 After each tragedy, you hear all the major Republicans call for thoughts and prayers, and suggest we should wait for the right time to talk about gun control. But I think there is an underlying current that isn't being written about. Most writers are laying a lot of blame on the NRA, calling their political donations \"blood money\". Can't disagree, but I think their donations really amount to peanuts in the big trillion dollar picture of what's at stake in every election. \n\nNone of the Republicans is so stupid that he or she can't see how gun violence is successfully limited in every civilized nation. It's right there for anyone to see. Give them that much credit. There's no point repeating over and over what would seem to be sensible steps to limiting it, which is what the press keeps doing.\n\nWhat's really happening, in every district and every state, is that candidates know that they have to align with the voting bloc keeping them in office. Every Republican, without exception, would't dare alienate the rural gun advocates who make up the base. The death toll is just the price that has to be paid for the freedom to confront anyone at our door with a lethal weapon. That's our American male macho ethos. \n\nThere's nothing we can do about it. It's not going to change., 9 Having shot an AR-15, courtesy of the US Army many years ago, I can attest to the wickedness of this weapon. It is made to kill people fast. I thought you would like to see a portion of the response from my Congressman Tom McClintock, when I wrote to him about the  shooting. It certainly speaks to the problem we have getting a Republican Congress to act.  I responded, but I won't belabor you with that. Whatever comes to mind, I probably said it.\n\n\"Thank you for sharing your thoughtful proposal regarding the safety of children in our schools.\n\"Protecting Second Amendment rights is a critical component to maintaining a safe and secure society.  Laws that aim to restrict or eliminate the ownership of firearms are often justified by arguing that we need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  The problem is that criminals don't follow laws; as a result, such measures only leave law-abiding citizens disarmed and defenseless against criminals and madmen.\n\"The result of these laws is that in places like Parkland, Florida and Newtown, Connecticut, innocent men, women, and children were denied access to the only means they might have had to protect their lives and the lives of those around them from assailants. I support repealing the federal ban on law-abiding citizens carrying weapons in schools and other public places in order to secure for these individuals the right to defend themselves against attackers.\nSincerely,\nTom\", 9 The Fake President's resorting to a violent, grotesque image, that he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and still have the support of his devoted base, revealed much about his fundamental personal devotion to a uniquely American, asocial, machismo gun culture. What a twisted way to posit the presumed loyalty of his electorate. What type of leader would ever desire the support of people who would tolerate such conduct?, 9 Trump is preparing his ineptitude defense for when Mueller finally gets around to charges. Trump will continue to be illogical and inept as  much as possible. He hopes people will think he is just stupid and not bright enough to actually commit a crime. \n\nNothing Trump has ever done or said could lead anyone to think that he would do anything for anyone else. This is exactly why conservative love him. He is one of them., 9 Its clear our gun experiment with guns for anyone is a nightmare.  As I read the comments on various sites, it has become apparent that many hard core gun lovers don't care at all about the ridiculous death rate in this country or dead kids. Many of the hard core gun lovers are anticipating some dark future and a need to use the guns and really don't care to hear any arguments against guns.\nWe now have so many guns out there and there is such deep serious resistance to life without guns, that we now are entering uncharted waters.  Its not clear how this is all going to end.  We may be at the point of no return with this gun issue and maybe we all now should arm ourselves in case a crazed shooter is near by. Thats crazy, of course, but may become reality. The NRA seems to suggest that kind of future.\nI don't think anyone has any idea how to now turn this around., 9 Ah yes,let's have better/more gun control.That will surely guarantee criminals will never illegally purchase an unregistered gun for cash in the dark alleys of major cities.Why not have a mandatory 20 year prison sentence without plea bargain/parole for crimes committed with guns., 9 The kids who shouted their warnings to Trump and a compliant Republican Congress to do something about gun violence in this country was a shot heard across the bow of the N.R.A. and the entire gun manufacturers establishment. These kids, the youth of today, the voters of tomorrow, are going to take names and kick some be-hind when they reach majority age. At least I hope their threats to these weak-kneed politicians will not lose steam as time passes. They can be sure of one thing. More and more of this kind of mass murder will continue. And the blame must be laid squarely where it belongs, on Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress. This also should effect many Democrats, folks like Bernie Sanders, who has supported gun owners because of the preponderance of hunters in his home state. This nonsense has to end. Congress has the right to create laws which heavily restricts the rights of gun ownership. If they do not act it is because they fear the N.R.A. and losing their exalted positions more than the people. If the people, especially the youth, make gun control a one-issue litmus test, for or against, as have other one issue advocates, and persist, then maybe politicians will take heed. They will do anything to stay in power. Not until one threatens that will anything be done.\n\nDD\nManhattan, 9 I think this piece's example of the Catholic Church is not entirely accurate- yes, there was complacency among a shocking number of clergy members. But the scandal remains a deep wound for the Church- it caused many people to leave the church in dissaproval and it remains a difficult subject for many lay-people. , 9 So an 18 year-old can't buy a beer but can buy an assault rifle.  That's just insane.  Clearly it comes down to money.  The gun manufacturers (aka the N.R.A.) versus rational people.  Here's a thought.  What if the celebs/rich people of the world basically bought the contracts of the Representatives who take N.R.A.  For example, Marco Rubio takes three million or there about.  Three million dollars is nothing for, say, Bob Iger.  Bob writes a check to Marco's PAC for 3.5 million on the condition that he votes in favor of gun control.  It is literally going to take a Gates Foundation type movement to pay the Republicans to vote like human beings.  But it is doable.  Jeff Bezos, are you listening?  Think about being the guy who put an end to put an end to assault rifles.  , 9 The photo accompanying Ms Dowd's piece, sent shivers down my spine. To see these young girls, surrounded by red lockers, with the shiny hair of youth, crouched in cowering submission, is heart breaking. I am a grandmother of two teenagers and I refuse to believe that my grandchildren's lives are less important than some gun owners right to bear arms. We must fight harder for our children., 9 I too lost hope after Newtown. As a teacher I feel so sad for all those who had a typical school day  and their lives turned upside down by gun violence. This latest shooting has shaken me again and I hope this time something will happen. Hopelessness is not the way; we must follow those who continue to try like Gabby Giffords. This time we must not let the anger die down; we must truly rise up and fight against guns in our communities., 9 In reference to the school walkout planned on the day of the Columbine tragedy I fully agree, but it should include more than just teachers and students. It needs to include every Mother and Father, brother, sister and relative in all professions. America needs to come to a grinding halt and show the world that safety is what the people are demanding from their leaders., 9 A veto proof Democratic majority is the only road to reasonable gun control., 9 I used to think Americans had some standing to opine to the world on what is right, how to govern, and how to make choices on divisive issues.  With guns as an example, and there are many more now, we have lost much of that moral authority. If we are a shining example, then the lights just got dimmer for 17 heartbroken families, classmates, and fellow teachers--to say nothing of millions of Americans who quietly think how lucky they are that their kids came home from school safely today.  , 9 Sara D below says: There are plans for students and teachers to walk out on April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting. The rest of us should join them.\nI like that idea but I like the idea more of every child walking out of schools until the government takes strong action against owners of such weapons. No one should be able to buy military quality armament. , 9 We have all watched the mass murders in this country with growing horror. Each horrible event worse than the last but I believe we have reached a tipping point. We need sensible gun laws and as Jimmy Kimmel said, congress works for us not the NRA and it's time for some sanity around guns or we may as well start over with different lawmakers because this lot is worthless. , 9 In 1994 my 16 year old son died from a gunshot wound. The searing pain in my heart was ever present for more than 5 years. 24 years later my heart is still broken, how does one find their way in a world that no longer makes sense after the loss of a beautiful child? I was the proverbial \"mother bear\", my greatest fear  was that something would happen to me before my son was grown leaving him without his mother to protect him.\nFor those that have yet to lose a precious child from gun violence there is still time, join with those of us that have lost a child to repeal the second amendment. Weapons today bear little resemblance to those of 1791; unfortunately our society bears little resemblance as well.\nThe meaning of democracy \"the people hold the power\", we can still affect change; if we don't protect our children who will?\nWe cannot protect our children from everything, but we together can make a difference here. Put your phones down, look in your children's beautiful faces, what would your life be like if you could no longer look at them, hold them, love them? You just don't want to know!, 9 Really have to stop bothering with the surprise that Trump's policies are unrelated to his earlier promises. He is in it for the money and the glory, and that sense of achievement that comes from confounding everyone's expectations. , 9 The Second Amendment - \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\" - is one sentence.  Militia and right to arms are connected.  In today's terms, this means we can have the National Guard and they can carry weapons.  The Constitution does not guarantee a right to own guns nor does the Constitution prohibit the possession of such.  State and federal legislators may act in this regard., 9 \"Each time, the outrage seems to fade faster.\"\n\nOutrage?  Outrage at a president whose every utterance is either an exaggeration or a lie? Outrage at a republican congress and supreme court that does lip service to religion and patriotism but has no notion of the meaning of either?\n\nOutrage at a sizable portion of the population that cannot tell the difference between a Russian disinformation campaign and reality? Or a cable news channel that takes advantage of the stupidest of us for the benefit of a few American oligarchs?\n\nWe are being slaughtered in service to a paragraph which has little application to our century. We are a nation of laws, but there is such thing as a bad law and we don't have the will to change it.  At the very same time that the amendment which precedes it is under full scale attack by the same charlatans who are exalting the second.\n\nOutrage is a very strong word but it doesn't do justice to the soft blanket of ignorance that has stilled our conscience and allows a few to corrupt our collective souls.\n\nIf Trump has done anything for us, he reminds us that democracy is fragile and precious.  When we no longer value it, pay lip service to our principles and turn over our country to incompetents, we reap what we have sown., 9 Obviously, if a law that 90% of the people wanted didn't pass, the problem is not the 90% people.\n\nIt is the NRA and their bought politicians.\n\nIn addition, with Gerrymandering many of the right are more afraid of a Tea Party or NRA lead primary opponent than a Democrat in the general election.\n\nAnd the Democrats lost that gun reform vote with 54 votes, a majority but not enough to override a filibuster.\n\nDon't blame the people or the Democrats.\n\nBlame the NRA and their followers and Republicans and Mitch McConnell, king of the filibuster during Obama.\n\nIf they believe in God, don't they think they will have to answer one day?, 9 Perhaps those who are complicit should be indicted for depraved indifference.\n\n\"To constitute depraved indifference, the defendant's conduct must be 'so wanton, so deficient in a moral sense of concern, so lacking in regard for the life or lives of others, and so blameworthy as to warrant the same criminal liability as that which the law imposes upon a person who intentionally causes a crime.\", 9 The \"right\" claims to be \"pro-life.\" But that's only when they want to control a woman's right to choose when to give birth or not.  What about the formerly fully grown or worse young children and teens who are killed because of the insanely lax gun laws in the United States? The G.O.P does NOT care that 13,000 people a year die in firearm assaults. Another 20,000 commit suicide with guns. So 33,000 people a year DEAD. Might some of those people harm others or themselves without guns - definitely. But the number would be drastically reduced. And mothers wouldn't have to worry about something as simple as sending their children off to school. The soulless men and women who are supposed to represent us care more about the campaign money they get from the NRA. Maybe they each have to lose a loved one to gun violence to wake up and smell the coffee. In the mean time we need to vote them OUT of office., 9 How much easier it is to live in a sane country that does not worship guns and that has a natural respect for life affirming values.\n\nBy becoming an expatriate I did not surrender to the selfishness and greed of America's aggressive capitalism. I simply got on a plane and within a few hours symbolically travelled backward in time to my childhood in northern Ohio where only one of my neighbors owned a gun.\n\nHere in Europe many multinational expatriate retirees congregate into villages where we can express mutual respect in waiting rooms by greeting each other upon arriving and saying goodbye when departing. \n\nThis spontaneous humanity to strangers captivated me when I first moved here fifteen years ago. Today, all these years later the same behavior remains unchanged.\n\nEvery time there is another gun fueled tragedy in America I say a quiet thank you  to all my neighbors for their unwavering decency!, 9 Some of the comments are going after Maureen for criticizing Obama, but I agree with her.  That was a great opportunity to accomplish something and he let us down.  It doesn't matter that Congress opposed him.  The President has the power and the responsibility to act and act forcefully.  Liberals must realize that Obama's impotence in this and other areas is linked directly to Trump's election.  Now we have someone who is capable of acting forcefully.  The only problem is, he uses that ability to serve his own self-interest instead of the nation's., 9 Next comes censorship.\nIf we can\u2019t censor gun ownership then the alternative is to stop covering the shootings.\nMost of the shooters would not do it if their blaze of glory wasn\u2019t shown on the television and other screens. , 9 I find the references to mental illness to be particularly unfortunate. Diagnosed mental illness is no more a risk factor for killing with a gun than no sign of mental illness means a person won\u2019t kill. The problem is a culture in which so many people are convinced that problems can be solved by ending a life (yours or someone else\u2019s) or by threatening to take a life. \n\nA person who tells me they keeps a loaded gun nearby or even has no gun but thinks it\u2019s ok when people do is saying they think killing is a solution and is far more likely to try and solve a problem that way than someone who believes harming others is never a solution; even if that person has a gun in the house that they use as a tool for hunting or other non violent purposes. \n\nKeeping a hammer in the garage and maybe even another in a kitchen drawer for hanging pictures or something is perfectly normal.  Keeping my hammers hidden around the house so you always have one handy if you need to protect yourself is not normal.  I think most people would agree with that because we have not grown up in a society where lots of people believe the violent use of hammers against other people is a way to solve a problem. \n\nI would never give a gun to the guy who keeps hammers for protection because he has already shown me that he is willing to use it. Guns become a huge problem because they were designed for quick, reliable lethality even at great distances., 9 Very sensible.\n\nWhen discussing the influence of money in politics, let's not forget that the NRA is the prototypical popular movement, financed mostly by small membership dues.  If you want average citizens to have influence in Washington, sometimes this is what you get.  Unfortunately., 9 If only the 'stable genius' (co-) author of The Art of the Deal could pull together all the CEO'S of the corporations that just got 'the biggest tax cut ever' from him. They could form a Gun Reduction consortium. The likes of Walmart, Amazon with help from Wall Street could offer gift card or financial incentives for people to turn in extra guns they don't need for self defense or for hunting. You know, those impulse purchases they just couldn't resist while browsing a gun show. That's a baby step but it's something, and doing something is better than doing nothing., 9 Mr. Trump and other NRA-funded flunkies claim that Newtown, Parkland and other uniquely American Tragedies are a function of the mental illness of the person shooting the assault weapon, not the weapon being shot. The illness is an all-American one. It's source may be in a mis-reading (or the incessant reading) of the Second Amendment, but it's protagonist is the NRA.\nIn the state of Tennessee, it is legal now for students to carry concealed firearms on state-affiliated campuses, even in bars. On the where I teach campus, there is an unknowable number of handguns in our classrooms, hallways, dining halls, and dorm rooms daily. And Tennessee is not alone; it is one of many states with such biased laws, favoring the rights of the few who fetishize gun ownership, over the rights of the many who simply wish to remain relatively safe in an unsafe world. Were one caught with a bottle of distilled spirits on campus, criminal charges would likely follow; as long as your Glock remains out of sight, you're good. The NRA of 2018 has virtually nothing in common with the NRA of 1918, nor 1871 (when it was founded to promote marksmanship).\nThrough its lobbing, and its directly funding a plurality of political futures in this country, the NRA is permitted to underwrite the deaths of far more American citizens each year than ISIS and al-Qaeda combinded. Why then would the NRA not be treated just as we treat ISIS and al-Qaeda? Guantanamo Bay is an excellent place to one's marksmanship., 9 It's impressive watching the young students participate in the gun control conversation. I just hope that they don't get too disappointed that politicians don't listen to them. They'll not be ignored because they're young, they'll be ignored because politicians ignore everyone that can't get them reelected or give them money., 9 Thank you, Ms. Down, for your continued voice in the fight for sensible gun control. As a resident of western Kentucky within 20 miles of Marshall County High School where the previous mass shooting took place, I can tell you from personal experience the devastation that such senseless acts wreak on a community. That these deaths continue, almost on a daily basis, says more about our country's moral turpitude than anything. Unless we act to stop this insanity the blood of our children will be forever on our hands., 9 Quite so. This feels like the tipping point moment. Everyone's hackles are up for so many reasons, and activism is proving to be effective the way it hasn't been since the 1960s. I do take exception with one of your sentences: surely you meant \"The American We Deserve\" the book GHOSTWRITTEN on Trump's behalf. The man cannot manage to string together a sentence, let alone pen one. He makes the men of the Bush family look positively eloquent, and that's saying something., 9 I fail to understand why so many citizens react with dismay to isolated minor tragedies that, after all, merely reflect a fundamental element of the nation\u2019s historic culture: specifically mass murder in the schools as a peripheral development, along with other random public massacres, issuing from the statistic of 15,000 or so firearms-related deaths yearly.  What with 270 million guns in private hands, we should simply learn to accept the situation as a sad, though logical situation.  Fortunately, however, our President and our Republican leadership are not allowing this phenomenon to distract them from the nation\u2019s true concerns: namely, the terrifying menace posed to harmless and peace-loving U.S. citizens by murderous illegal immigrants, hence the critical necessity to build a wall along the southern border and protect the fortunes of the nation\u2019s highly vulnerable billionaires.       , 9 Thank you, Maureen--I don't think you are quite fair to President Obama here, as I think that the opposition he faced was implacable.  Still, I share your aims, and appreciate your ardor.\n\nAs a side point, I find the recent uproar about the FBI flubbing a tip misplaced--given our gun laws, what was the FBI to do about Mr. Cruz even if they had made a more thorough investigation?  We live in a country where even if they had found him to be mentally unstable, it seems unclear that they could have stopped him from purchasing an arsenal.  Were they supposed to keep him under permanent surveillance in advance of a crime?  Commit him in advance of a crime?  (There is certainly no public money available from treatment under the GOP regime.)\n\nThere are plenty of mentally ill and violent people well known to law enforcement because of domestic abuse and protection orders that are allowed to purchase guns and later use them for slaughter.  Why would this have been any different?  (Oh, I get it - it wouldn't have been, but the point supplies Trump and his minions with handy lip service.) , 9 Trump's new mantra--for a few minutes--is \"making our schools safer.\" (He could call it MOSS, sort of like MAGA). Absolutely, great idea. But what about the shooting in the nightclub in Florida, the church in Texas, the outdoor music festival in Las Vegas, the office party in California, the movie theater in Colorado? Don't these venues deserve to be made safe from mass shootings too? Do we need airport style security at the entrance to every public building in the country? Evidently so, when anybody can get a high-capacity shooting machine., 9      Our President spent his weekend Tweeting his disappointment with this most recent school shooting by blaming the FBI.  He also blame President Obama. He seemingly thinks that there is a connection between the infamous Russian election interference and this school shooter investigation.\nConsider the thought processes that the President goes through (or doesn't go through) to write his Tweets.  Soon he will Tweet that it was MS-13, an immigrant, or the Democrats, generally, that are at fault.  We have elected a whiner in chief to lead a candle lighting, praying, whining Congress to protect us from mass shootings.\n     The fact that our Congress is so paralyzed that it cannot deal with gun control, trade issues, the national debt, health care, or immigration is amazing to me.  It can hand out huge debt driving tax cuts to its benefactors, but deal with the tough issues?  Never!  Is there no one with moral authority, or intelligence who is left to lead this nation? Maybe you shouldn't answer that., 9 Maureen, I'm glad you focused on our collective abilities to move on from these mass shootings.  If Congress and the president thought they would ever be held accountable for their inaction, they would act.  But, we're not holding them accountable. The NRA and second amendment zealots make it their number one voting priority and they always vote.  Polls show that the rest of us care about jobs, the economy, healthcare etc.  Gun safety doesn't even register while the \"second amendment\" does.   If Congress getting shot and Newtown didn't move us, what will?  Those teenagers in Florida have every right to scream at us, but I'm not sure we parents have the right to scream at Trump or anyone else.  Unlike Maureen, I never thought Trump would do a darn thing and we all know it is a non starter for Congress (\"Now's not the time.\" \"Thoughts and prayers.\"). \n\nI don't want to \"pile on\" to Florida's grief, but maybe they should start with their own back yard: repeal Stand your Ground law, tighten up your laws and stop electing the likes of Rick Scott (never understood how a state full of Medicare recipients elected a Medicare Fraudster...) and Marco (now's not the time to discuss guns) Rubio., 9 Use of an assault weapon must require membership in a state's national guard.  All assault weapons must be controlled by the guard armory.  Firearms for hunting, home or personal protection must be limited to revolvers, pump action shotguns, and bolt-action rifles.  , 9 As with almost everything, follow the money. Why is the NRA so powerful? Because of their unlimited funds available for campaign contributions. Why do all state and national campaigns need so much money? To pay for TV ads. If we can ban TV ads for cigarettes, why can't we ban all TV political ads? Who knows what our congressmen and Senators could accomplish without the daily drudge of fund raising to buy TV ads that are universally hated. Without a market for TV ads, the NRA's stranglehold might be broken. Who knows how many politicians secretly hate guns but are forced to accept NRA money?, 9 The only answer is to throw the bums out, but that's never going to happen. Not as long as money speaks louder than the will of the people.  The gun issue is but a microcosm of what's gone so terribly wrong with what was once intended, in a galaxy now far, far away, to be a government of, by and for the people. , 9 Follow the money-always! Greed Over People isn't a cute acronym for the Republican party. Greed controls too much. Trump received significant contributions from the NRA and now he says nothing about guns. Gun manufacturers do well either when the NRA scares the public that a Democrat will take away their guns or the laws make it easier to purchase weapons of mass destruction (AK-15, etc) or bump stocks or maybe soon silencers.  \n\nOf course, someone who wants to kill others has mental, moral, emotional, and spiritual issues. We will never determine every potential murderer. We reduce the threat and the human carnage by doing what every other nation has done - reduce the availability. \n\nGreed is a very different illness from killing people, but it is a sickness affecting this democracy to our core. We cannot ignore killers nor those who in the name of making money cause damage to our air, water, land and make available instruments of human destruction.  , 9 As citizens we should not allow members of congress and the senate to make rules about who can carry guns and where they should carry them until there are mandatory guns in their chambers. \n\nWhy should we be the only ones who are at risk at work?, 9 We, as a society, would be fine and dandy without AR-15's. \n\nAnother thing we don't need is cotton candy.\n\nAR-15 owners: Would you be willing to give up your right to eat cotton candy if it would save the lives of innocent school children?\n\nI would.\n\nIf there was even an infinitesimal chance that banning cotton candy would save the life of one child, I would give up my right to eat cotton candy.\n\nCotton candy is yummy. Cotton candy is fun. Cotton candy makes us feel good.\n\nBut it would be a matter of which I valued more: my Constitutional right to eat cotton candy (which is, admittedly, yummy) (and, admittedly, if cotton candy was outlawed, only outlaws would have cotton candy), or the lives of school children?\n\nI know, I know - I'm a softie. But I would gladly forsake my right to eat cotton candy if there was even a chance it MIGHT save the life of one child.\n\nSince AR-15's are no more necessary for human well-being than cotton candy - why not take a chance?\n\nHow much worse would life be if your gun only shot one bullet at a time?\n\nUltimately, what's more important to you? The lives of school children, or your precious right to own any kind of cockamamie technology, no matter how catastrophically dangerous it is?\n\nWhat rights would you be willing to give up to protect kids?\n\nI know that many AR-15 owners will say your right to own a gun is more important, because it is about your right to defend yourself.\n\nI would just ask you to think about what you're saying., 9 \"But then the NRA spent 30 million on him.\"\nYou hit the nail on the proverbial head with that statement, Ms. Dowd.  Can someone please explain to me--I am a physician--why I would never accept a slice of pizza or a pen from a pharmaceutical company and my elected Congressmen see no problem accepting millions of dollars from the NRA?  Can they not see the clear conflict of interest in their actions?  The NRA donations to Congressional members and their voting records on gun issues should be plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the country between now and the midterm elections., 9 Listen to the voice of powerful brave teenagers who are speaking out against the government officials, Senators, Congressmen and particularly to Donald Trump.\nThere is only one way to have restricted gun laws, vote tho gun lobbying loving people OUT.\nPlease Vote that is the only solution to stop this easy access of guns ., 9 Two of the most destructive factors in American life in this century have been the Citizens United ruling and the power of the NRA. NRA money is tainted, because candidates who receive it can no longer vote according to their consciences but must follow the organization's guidelines. That's as good a definition of \"bought and paid for\" that I can think of.\nI am one person, and I can't do much--but what I can do, I will. I vow not to vote for a single candidate who takes a single dollar from the National Rifle Association.\nWhat if a majority of voters took up this vow?, 9 \"The America We Deserve\". I think we have it... our craven politicians are so enthralled by the gun lobby, and we've been distracted, 'wedge-issued' and Russia-trolled into partisan tribes, and the inability to do anything while guns facilitate mayhem and murder everywhere is the result. Until Americans recognize that the safety of everyone is tied together, that more guns will NOT make things better, until Americans see our nation as more than just their own tribe of Republicans, evangelicals, progressives, or 'I don't care' know-nothings, and do something together to protect everyone, we'll face massacre after massacre. And there's a daily un-remarked upon toll of 90 'onesie-twosie' ordinary gun deaths churning. If it were \"radical Islamic terrorists\" doing the killing of 90 Americans a day, everyone would unit to do something, our politicians would jump to spend Billions and invade countries. But passing any gun control legislation (or anything else) to prevent even some of those 90 gun deaths a day is beyond our capacity. I think we have right now today \"The America We Deserve\". And Trump is just the icing on that cake., 9  \"Treating children as collateral damage is intolerable.\" Yes, I certainly agree. What I suggest is million children March on the 15th of April. Parents from across the nation should bring their children  to Washington D.C. for a march up Constition Avenue. At this point in my life with a very successful daughter, I worry about my grand-children, they too should march against this senseless violence. \n\n life with a very successful daughter, I worry about my grand-children, they too should march against this senseless violence., 9 At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I believe this time, it is different.  The children slaughtered were in a blue state area whose parents, though valiantly attempting,  could not break the stranglehold the NRA has on this warped nation. But the kids victimized this time are young adults, apolitical in a fairly purple state, who have had enough and know how to challenge and shame their elders on social media. They may not even be able to vote yet, but their parents sure can and right now, they all have contempt for the politicians defending a military rifle over human lives. The NRA and Trump can hunker down all they want, but the young lion has been awoken , 9 Since adults seem unable to act, maybe it is time for the children to show the way.  I hear there are the seeds of a movement by high school kids to boycott school fearing for their lives.  What if this idea gains traction, and the high school students are joined by college students and even middle school aged children.  I think K thru 5 kids need to be sheltered as much as possible - the hope for the innocence of youth.\n\nIf supposedly 90% of the adult population supports sensible gun laws, and do nothing, maybe our children can become a beacon for action.  Nothing else seems to be working., 9 At this point, one should be compassionate. But compassion doesn't excuse culpability. \n\nIn the scheme of things, Lucy Richards is a pawn. She is a Florida woman who used to harassed grieving parents of Newtown shooting victims and got sentenced recently. But who are behind this zombie army of conspiracy theories about school shooting. (NYT should do an expose on them. Are People like Jones and  Lim-bot  a front of something more sinister?) The chicken is coming home to roost.\n\nScott is rumored to have his ambition on being a congressman. But how many mass shootings happened on his watch? It is incredulous to see Trayvon Martin died an innocent death just the same. And the so-called \"stand your ground\" law just got weirder. It is a surprise NRA approved congressmen & women haven't come up with some \"arm every kid\" idea, like Gohmert said after Aurora shooting or NRA arming every school. With nutty ideas like these, forget about gun control. \n\nSo blaming President Obama and the so-called Democrat majority senate is just silly when many of Obama's prudent ideas were effectively obstructed by the Grand Obstruction Party. Not just guns but also finance and other life sustaining stuff. Now, America has handed her future Trump, Republicans and the regressive judicuary lock, stock and barrel. Sorry, Ms Dowd, perhaps the America Conscience is barking up the wrong proverbial tree, 9 Regarding Obama and the Democratic senate, everyone seems to forget the filibuster.\n\nThe Democrats lost that with 54 votes, a majority but not the 60 needed for the filibuster., 9 Our problem is not the N.R.A. or spineless politicians.  Iit is first the people who buy the N.R.A.'s illogical propaganda, and second the people who do not buy this propaganda but continue as members for other reasons.  , 9 Maureen has now Trump on her sights and no one will criticize her for that. But it is time she acknowledge to herself that her attitude towards Obama has little to do with Obama's deficiencies and more to do with something in her psyche, She could not resist blaming Obama for not single handedly overcoming the GOP opposition and the red state Democrats on this issue. I am surprised she did not include Hillary and Bill, another pair of rascals in her firmament., 9 NRA and military guns must go. we are on the edge.\nthe nation must rise. if congress is owned by the NRA we must\novercome. votes- revolution- whatever., 9 So, what is it going to take for American citizens to say that enough is enough and vote with your feet. You can come to Australia and bring your knowledge, skills, experience with you. It matters not what the colour of your skin is or what religion you practice, we will welcome you. \n\nThe only thing you will not be able to bring is your guns. You won't need them. We have very strict gun laws and only those who actually need a weapon can get a license subject to strict vetting procedures. \n\nOur gun laws violates nobodies rights. They do offer vast protections and security to our people though. We are one of the safest nations on earth and our children thrive in a gun free environment. If you can't change your gun laws maybe it is time to change your country., 9 Tax cuts, deregulation, or imposing conservative religious sexual mores must be more important than strangers' lives to those millions who poll in favor of gun control, but who vote for Republicans anyway.  , 9 Perhaps this is actually working for the GOP and their long term goals. Make public schools unsafe. Shut down public schools. Educate poor and middle class children via online, for profit with no accountability institutions. Save good education for the 1%. Isn't that where we're going anyway......like Russia?, 9 I would love to see a one-day country-wide walkout by American high school students. Even just a few hours would do. Let your elders know you will not accept being live targets and demand some form of gun control NOW. Given your generation's extensive and intensive use of social media, that cannot be so hard to organize. Say Monday Feb. 26th at 10 AM. Just do it and shame your elders. , 9 There is no word base enough to express the visceral, soul-killing, reality of those in power continuing to treat school age children as disposable fodder for the 2nd Amendment. , 9 In the days since the FL school shooting, I have tried to consider both sides of the gun debate. One side seems totally intractable.....even when the bullet riddled bodies of children are the latest evidence of a need for legislative change. The other side, equally dug in, is howling for the heads of congressional members beholden to the NRA. Then something struck me. Where have I seen this type of ideological rigidity before? In what issue has the fear of ceding an inch to the other side seemed equally anathema? Where in the past have constitutional rights been the fulcrum of the argument. Try 2nd amendment and \"privacy\". The parallel between gun rights and abortion rights is too close to ignore. Much like a ban on partial birth abortion has the left screaming about a \"slippery slope\" leading to back alley operations; NRA members deem a restriction on assault rifles the beginning of an attempt to confiscate all guns. The left has been forced into the position that a baby on the 30th day of the 9th month is not a person and can be tossed away The right can't even see clear to ban \"bump stocks\" that modify otherwise automatic rifles into machine guns. The country has backed into respective corners and seems incapable or unwilling to take an honest look at the others' rationale. Politicians are gutless on both sides... spew the party line and keep that precious seat. Babies are indeed dying....at the hand of a doctor and at the end of a gun. Why can't we do something to stop it, 9 Thank you for the reminder about Trump's former opinions on gun laws and how they've changed since he raked in all the NRA cash. The comparisons to the Catholic church and Weinstein are right on, too.\n\nMaureen Dowd is so much better when she's angry than when she's snarky. I gave up on her a few years ago, when I got sick and bored with her constant jabs at \"Barry\" and Hillary, but over the last year or so I've been peeking in now and then. This time, it's really worth it. She's getting her mojo back. , 9 Bravo.  So glad you're with us on this.  Hope your brother is too, we could use his help!, 9 The mass shootings aren't collateral damage to the gun business plan. They ARE the business plan. All this killing and death - you better buy guns! The schools better buy guns! Shopping malls! We need guns everywhere, toted by everyone, all the time!\n\nThis week is a personal tragedy for some but another great triumph for the NRA. Nothing at all will happen. The NRA wins! Politicians will declare that only more guns will help us. The NRA wins!\n\nThere is a way to make the NRA lose. We need to see the victims of gun violence, whose loved ones were killed or maimed, all around us every day. There are 30,000+ gun deaths per year, more than a million in a single generation, many millions of loved ones who remain gun victims for life. Where are they all?? I walk around town and never have to see them. Every stricken home should bear a respectful signpost. All the victims-for-life should display bumper stickers, pins, T-shirts and other wearables reminding us that they lost a loved one, some showing a bloodied NRA logo, some showing a photo of the deceased, as often as they can bear it. We should never go a day without seeing that gun tragedy is everywhere, all around us, not just statistics but that mother and that husband and that child and him and her and her and her and him....We need a visceral association between the NRA and death and personal, individual tragedy, all around us every day. \n\nThat's when politicians will fear an \"A\" NRA grade. That's when we win., 9 The most startling event in this whole sorry episode has been the President's refusal to either express regret or propose to change the law that allows lunatics among us to buy portable machine guns. \n\nThey are beyond hope, especially President Trump. The result of our lack of any controls on weapons is the mass murder of innocents. Since this has now become a key plank in the Republican Party, the solution is to recruit schoolchildren to refuse to ever vote for one of their candidates, and to persuade their parents to make the same pledge. \n\nThere are ways to reach these children, both through social media and via ground campaigns in school boards. Otherwise, we will devolve into a fossil fuel loving, weapons obsessed, and internally weak nation that will end up failing in other areas as well. The Republican Party is creeping into Nazi territory, and as soon as the President declares a war they will match them., 9 It is now clear that no school is safe, no movie theater or music festival or church. A person with a war machine can easily, easily, ever so easily step in and snuff out lives. The wonder of it all is that the people running the country prefer this fearsome anarchy, willingly walking their citizens into a place of blood and fear and despair. , 9 Your best column since you knocked out Ken Starr.  But the topic is much more important.  Children must never be collateral damage.  But this is the same society where discrimination against is perfectly legal (they are not even allowed to live in certain communities).  It is also a society where children born out of wedlock are often called illegitimate children.  But there is no such thing as an illegitimate child., 9 I truly hope the Dems are ready to be brave when we get our majorities., 9 It is sad to think of the number of kids that will be shot until we can get back in control this coming November with Trump out and tweeting alone from his tower.. Being re-elected to most Republicans now in congress is more important than the lives of our children., 9 Trump went to Florida primarily to spend the weekend at Mar-a-lago. Perfect excuse! By the way, did he work it in to tell grieving parents that there was no collusion? , 9 Missourians could start by discharging Senator Roy (Blunt by name, Blunt by nature) Blunt, the champion of accepting NRA donations and loose change. Don\u2019t expect congress to do anything., 9 re \"Treating children as collateral damage is intolerable\":\n\nThe word \"intolerable\" has become as meaningless as the more popular \"unacceptable.\" It's an end itself. Empty. Without any follow-up.\n\nWe tolerate the mass slaughter of schoolchildren and other innocents with military-style, rapid-fire assault weapons legally (but not morally) in the hands of civilians. We accept it. And we have allowed it to become routine.\n\nSo who's to blame? We are. A presumably civilized society. By continually electing spineless lawmakers who sacrifice their consciences -- in exchange for blood money -- at the altar of the National Rifle Association and its willfully cynical misinterpretation of the 18th-century Second Amendment.\n\nAs we've been saying to ourselves at least since Columbine ... and Sandy Hook ... and now Parkland ... not to mention the likes of Las Vegas, Orlando, Blacksburg and Sutherland Springs ... and ... and .... and ... \"Until next time.\" And there most definitely will be a \"next time.\" Many of them, in fact.\n\nFor shame.\n\nWhere else in the world does this kind of tragic condoned carnage persist with impunity? Nowhere.\n\nIt's a wonder that we're able to face our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren without getting down on our knees and begging their forgiveness. Every time we see them. Because, as the people of Parkland just found out, there's bound to come a day when we won't., 9 Treating Trump as a reasonable negotiator is intolerable.\nHe's a clear and present danger to everything decent in our society and politics; an evil role model for children and adults.  We the People should encourage him and his crime family to self deport to Russia., 9 Perhaps an effective strategy would be to call out the top recipients of NRA contributions (BRIBES would be more accurate) and keep the pressure on them. We need to relentlessly target them! (Pun intended.)\n\nI guess I haven't been paying attention to how much the NRA gives to politicians, probably because I've felt hopeless and demoralized by the hold they seem to have on Congress. But I'm paying attention now. I was so uninformed that I had no idea Mr. McCain was the recipient of the LARGEST BRIBE from the NRA. It flies in the face of everything I have believed about his character. I haven't always agreed with him politically but I always thought he was basically a good and decent man. That respect is gone forever.\n\nMr. McCain you will go to your grave unmourned and unhonored by me. You have sold your soul and your sacred honor for $7 million. You will be remembered by the legacy of shame that was purchased with the blood of innocent people. Was it worth the price?, 9 Ms. Dowd, I went back and read the comments on your shame article on President Obama and not passing gun control laws.  You were a bit naive  in your assessment of what the president could do during that period of time.  The NRA lobbyists and congress people beholden to them were not going to let gun laws of any kind be passed.  \n\nThe majority of people in this country voted for Clinton and yet Trump was elected.  Case closed.  , 9 Where in the heck are our pro-life people?! If there was a gun shop next to a Planned Parenthood, the protesters would not cross that line, if not oddly supporting the gun shop. This is an issue where the Progressives could use a little help in numbers. Clergy - can you really not convince your flock to feel as guilty about owning handguns as other guilty pleasures? I guess losing that warm body in the pew isn't worth the risk.\n\nLike talking to divorced parents - do it for the children!, 9 We've met the enemy and he's us.  When poor family dynamics, social isolation, social media immersion, early childhood trauma, meet free access to assault rifles you have dead children, churchgoers,concertgoers.\nIt's a unique American sickness.  The world is shaking its head., 9 Assault rifles such as the AR-15 were banned, briefly, under Bill Clinton. Bush 43, caving to the G.O.P. base, allowed the ban to expire.\nEven Justice Scalia, writing the Heller opinion, stated that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to \"weapons of war.\" Machine guns, fully automatic arms and RPG's are banned throughout the land, despite the N.R.A.\nThe reason the base and the N.R.A. will not budge on AR-15s and other assault rifles is that they do not buy them to hunt...game. Like the maniacs in Waco and Idaho, they stockpile these weapons because they foresee a day of reckoning between themselves and the federal government of their country.\nKind of like 1861, with bigger magazines. Theses people and their leaders must be stopped.    , 9 The one you most often criticiszed during the 2016 campaign was Hillary Clinton. She argued for \u2018sensible\u2019 gun laws, including restrictions on the kind of weapon used this week at the high school in Florida.\n\nPerhaps it must be a broader discussion about rights and the fact that no right is absolute, even those derived from the 2nd Amendment. Justice Holmes argued the point when he referenced falsely shouting \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theater.\n\nMs. Dowd, don\u2019t let the dialogue end with this column. How many Columbines, Las Vegas, Sandy Hook and Orlando shootings does a columnist for a great newspaper need to make this a national debate about the unwillingness of one governing political party to ignore the wishes of the American people., 9 Mental health and security are not the key issues in mass shootings.\n\nAmerica\u2019s addiction to guns and violence is a disease. Too many innocents have died. But the fact remains that NOTHING has been done on the issue of gun related violence.\n\nThe key issues are the proliferation of and the easy access to guns. There are an estimated 357 million firearms . An estimated 31% of households, or one in three Americans, own guns.  And what are guns used for ??? Guns are used for no other reason than to kill !!!\n\nThe high and unacceptable incidence of gun related deaths in the US is not only a scourge and cancer in America it is a National Security and National Health risk issue adversely impacting all Americans.\n\nBut debates in Congress and the Senate continue to be focused on peripheral issues, like magazine size. But the facts remain that the culture of gun violence is out of control !!! and NOTHING has been done !!!\n\nThe reality is that all of the debates on the need to improve controls on guns and gun ownership are DEBATES ON THE MARGINS. Any new legislation to strengthen gun controls will affect only new purchases of guns. Any such new legislation will leave the remaining guns already owned unaffected, grandfathered by earlier laws. Tinkering on the margins has not and never will work. There is only one solution to solve the issue of gun violence and deaths.\n\nThe Second Amendment must be repealed.\n\nThe new law should be called: \u201cThe Innocents\u2019 Law.\u201d\n\nBring peace to America., 9 Trump is not much of a negotiator. That's why his presidency is a mess. That's why his businesses so often had to use bankruptcy and breach of contract as their modus operandi. The only things he's negotiated in the last few decades are divorce settlements, play-for-pay money laundering schemes with Eastern European criminals, non-disclosure settlements with his sex partners, and the price to be paid for the use of his last name.\n\nIf we're going to get sensible gun control in this country, it will have to begin at the grass roots, just like any other movement. If the people lead, the leaders will eventually follow. How about a March on Washington for an end to gun violence!, 9 Republicans: pro-life, until it gets in the way of THEIR \u2018beliefs\u2019 yet, they are willing to risk our kids lives.\n\nRepublicans: Anti-socialist; believing regulating gun ownership equates to some form of socialist plot. What lies they tell themselves to please their masters. To hold tight to their power. \n\nRepublicans: ignoring a Russian plot against America. They do and say one word that their fearless  leader abrogates his responsibility to protect the USA. Using him as a convenient fool, a battering ram against progressive, civil society. To push their agenda and risk our democracy., 9 'The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and our parents to call BS.Companies trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn't reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS. Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS. They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS. They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.'\n\nFrom a passionate young woman, Emma Gonzalez, who speaks about the insane proliferation of guns and school killings.  She is a student at the high school in Parkland, Florida, where this latest horrific mass killing took place.\n\nIt was estimated in 2014 that there are 240 million adults living in the United States.  The NRA boasts membership of 5 million which is roughly 2% of the adult population of America.   Why does such a small percentage of American adults control our populace with its fear tactics?, 9 Turns out you and President Trump have more in common than you'd like to believe, Ms. Dowd.\n\nYou both have an intense dislike of President Obama. With Trump it's pretty obvious why he dislikes Obama given that the birth of his outright animosity was birtherism. With you, I'm not sure?\n\nThe other thing you and Trump have in common is your lack of understanding in how legislation is passed in this country, as well as a lack of understanding about filibusters.\n\nRepublicans controlled the House and the Democrats did not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate when Obama tried to get gun-control passed in 2012. \n\nYou can't pass a gun-control bill with this scenario.\n\nYet you can write an entire column about guns, placing blame on Trump where it definitely belongs, and Obama where the blame doesn't belong, but not even mention the spineless, feckless Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. \n\nLook at his responses after Sandy Hook, Orlando, Las Vegas, Parkland. The same disgusting non-action, offering meaningless prayers.\n\nThat bill Trump signed last year? Both Ryan and the House and the Senate passed that pro-gun bill a year ago last February, H.J. Res 40, revoking an Obama-era regulation, signed by Trump without a photo, in private? The Obama measure blocked some people with severe mental health problems from buying guns. \n\nIt was a measure passed by Obama in response to Sandy Hook, Ms. Dowd.\n\nWhy don't you go after the people who really are to blame for this American carnage?, 9 Americans - who are 5% of the global population - own roughly half of the world's 650 million civilian guns.\n\nAmericans own far more guns per capita than 2nd-place, 4th world Yemen, which is still stuck in the 12th century.\n\nAmerica is the world's leading gun insane asylum, with a bumper crop of mental defectives, misfits and walking time bombs waiting for their fuses to go  off at a theater near you.\n\nRepublicans like to offer thoughts, prayers and more guns every time there's a new massacre....nothing expresses sympathy for a gun murder better than making another gun murder more likely.\n\nThat would be like handing out more kerosene and matches to members of the community every time an apartment building burnt down instead of mandating smoke detectors, an emergency fire/police telephone number, and fire education and safety.\n\n\"We don't need that damn, stupid regulation of fire 'free-dumb', says the National Fire Association, their Grand Old Pyromaniac Congress and their match-lighting voter base....this is about the freedom to burn down whatever building we want as ordained by the God of Fire.\"\n\nThe merchants of gun death in America - the gun company owners, the NRA, the Guns Over People party, and their propagandized gun-fetishizing voter base, have delivered their deranged tyranny-of-the-minority verdict to America:\n\nSchools full of dead children are the best that America can do.\n\nThe country's children must die, so our guns can live.\n\nNice GOPeople.\n\nVote November 6 2018., 9 \"The business of America is business,\" declared President Calvin Coolidge. Such a statement pretty much summarizes the NRA and the politicians who have sold their souls to them, as they run and hide behind the 2nd Amendment. \n\nUntil we the people critically assess the failures of American capitalism and acknowledge that not everything needs to be for sell -- including our politicians --, we may likely have to continue to witness such horrors in our country.\n\nOn that note, our politicians who talk about individual rights seem to conveniently forget Thomas Jefferson's provision in the Declaration of Independence that if our government becomes destructive, we the people have the right to alter or abolish it and institute a new government. , 9 Ms. Dowd:\nThis is a beautiful column.  It is direct; it marshals facts; it weaves them together eloquently with argument and analogy, and uses the analogy to find hope in the bleakest of landscapes.\nI hope it does as you intend and indeed mobilizes the vast majority of Americans who believe this is intolerable but, at least until now, have seemed paralyzed., 9 I see a bleaker America, now that children are killing children. We call the former 'monster' and the latter 'angel.' \n\nPaul Ryan's mantra is \"this is not the time...\" Funny - which is dead serious - that you mentioned about the rescinding of social security's information sharing rule, Grassley and Rubio, among others, were on the high horse just a couple of days earlier proclaiming America should do something about mental health, but the neglect to mention they were the ones who voted to reverse the rule.\n\nIf America can approach guns like substance abuse, say alcoholism, perhaps there is a chance. A lot of people got into drinking because of other problems. Then drinking itself is the problem. So, whatever problems plaguing the alcoholic, s/he needs to stop drinking first. Take away the booze and you deal with other issues. \n\nSo why is it so difficult to apply to the same logic to gun violence? The only plausible explanation is that that is a demonic cult at play here. It requires blood sacrifice. The more innocent the blood, the more it likes it., 9 \"When societies try to protect a malevolent status quo, they become warped.\" \n\nMaureen has seen the greater truth behind the absurd notion that Americans have the right tote guns everywhere and anywhere. But why should we have to engage in this debate at all? The answer is we are indeed warped, not just about guns, but about mental illness, social justice, science, education, health care and any number of markers of advanced civilizations other countries addressed long ago. \n\nDoes anyone doubt this president is capable of calling out his gun-toting supporters if it looks like he might be jeopardized by the Mueller investigation? We're at a crossroads in American history and unless some prominent Republicans take the lead against our \"malevolent status quo,\" we won't just be warped, we'll be broken., 9 Seventeen empty lockers, 17 empty desks, 17 empty beds and 34 parents and spouses grieving over children and partners they will never kiss, hug, laugh with or see again.  Additionally, thousands more children around the country will now need therapy and counseling because, as one teenager shared with me:  I'm tired of being afraid of simply going to school.  \n\nAt some point a man's \"constitutional right\" to own an AR-15 has to be outweighed by a mom's \"pursuit of happiness\" to simply kiss her child good bye each morning without wondering if that'll be the last time she does.  If that sounds like exaggeration and hyperbole there's 17 moms in Parkland who would give anything, anything to wish that it was.        \n\nEnough. Those of us who oppose this madness have to finally stand up and say that we will never again vote for a politician who supports the availability of, and access to, semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 in its present form.  It should be the first question we ask, and if they reply in the affirmative, the last answer we hear.   , 9 A nationwide strike by teachers and parents, along with a coinciding massive march on Washington and more significant lobbying efforts might be a good place to begin.  What is standing in the way?, 9 i think it is time to sue Mitch McConnell for his dereliction of duty to protect the american people from assault weapons and other guns, like bumstock, etc. he has refused to bring about a vote even though the majority of American believe and want  gun control. perhaps a suit would show him to do his job and serve ALL the people in this country. we must do something! to be silent is complicit!, 9 maureen,  if you and other journalists had saved your criticism of HRC for after she got elected we might not be in this awful situation.  surely some of the blame for the FBIs failure to act on the information about the shooter in this instance can be laid at the feet of trump and the disarray he has caused in the bureau., 9 Senator Chuck Grassley:  \"And we have not done a very good job of making sure that people that have mental reasons for not being able to handle a gun getting their name into the FBI files and we need to concentrate on that.\"\n\nThis from the man who sponsored the same bill that you mentioned which makes it easier for \"mentally ill\" people to obtain guns.\n\nBut what about Las Vegas?  Is every shooter \"mentally ill\"?  I think not.  This is the same old excuse to allow assault weapons to be sold to people who are not in the least interested in self defense.  \n\nGrassley and trump and all similar \"politicians\" are on the \"take\" from the NRA.  Here is hoping that the FBI is able to link Russian campaign contributions being funneled to candidates through the NRA.  We will then see how many \"Manchurian Candidates\" we have who are compromised by Russian money and hopefully rid ourselves of the NRA., 9 \"Then I gave up.\"  For once I sympathize with Maureen Dowd--despite all of these mass shootings which are now  happening on a regular basis America just can't make any headway when it comes to gun control.  Innocent gun owners resent being stereotyped as heartless thugs for owning firearms.  Presidents of both parties are reduced to making canned speeches and some clucking noises reassuring  nervous citizens  that a solution to gun violence will be found soon.  But nothing ever comes of it.  There are the usual touchy feely OP ED columns calling for the Second Amendment to be repealed--something that the Southern and Western states will never  agree to.  \n\nI've decided to give up too.  What's the point???, 9 if congress will do nothing let the staes begin...\n\n6 minutes ago\nMany states sell alcohol through tightly controlled state stores...Let\u2019s do the same with guns, and staff them with knowledgeble sales people not out to make a quick buck, and highly trained screeners who would conduct required interviews with buyers. In addition buyers would have to hold state gun licenses renewed every 5 years and submit to both background checks and a one week wait before completing the transaction. This will, for the most part, eliminate impulse purchases. While we\u2019re at it, no one under the age of 21 will be permitted to buy a gun or ammunition of any kind. Private sales must be conducted at a state store with both parties present. All guns will be registered and must be kept under lock and key. This will be a huge inconveniance for some....that\u2019s good.\nIt will also save thousands of lives, address the mental health question, while supporting responsible owners and protecting the public at large., 9 Our politicians are beholden to NRA because they donate heavily to those \"elected\" officials who do their bidding, meaning doing nothing about gun control.\n\nThe only way this stranglehold NRA has on politicians can be broken is to have those with money and who care about the country, the Warren Buffets and Jeff Bezos of this country, step up, as they did to address the healthcare challenge.\n\n\"Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable,\" said Warren Buffet regarding the cost of healthcare.\n\nWe need to have a coalition of the rich and powerful to address the scourge of gun violence in this country with similar sentiments: \"do not accept it as inevitable.\", 9 You want Congress to do something?\nPass a federal law that ANY crime involving a gun (even selling or possessing a gun illegally) is a federal crime with a mandatory minimum of 20 years. Second offense, mandatory Life, no parole.\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) can build more prisons to house the inmates. It may be advantageous to build \u201cgun prisons\u201d specifically in very remote areas to house the 20 year minimums. Certainly, there needs to be a gun Lifer prison in the most desolate place we can find.  This will be an expense, but the cost will be offset by a precipitous decline in gun crime with the associated cost savings from crime reduction. There should be planned and built an additional supermax, just so that there is a jail that even the hardest cases dread https://youtu.be/JVCRjdN3UTM\nThis is terribly harsh, I understand, and that is the whole point. A percentage of gun criminals will be deterred from the start, but over time, as criminals see associates go away, the reality of being involved with a gun will set in. If you cannot get a gun legally, you\u2019ll stay away. It won\u2019t stop crime, but it will stop gun crime.\nEnforcement will be simple enough: Local police will work as usual and notify the feds when they have a gun criminal in custody. After the local process has ended, the gun criminal will face federal charges (this is the way the UCMJ works).\nOwning legally would not make you Teflon, if you break a law with the gun, 20 & Life.\nThis is worth a try, no?, 9 \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\n\nThese are the fundamental Rights upon which Our Constitution is based.  Twenty-seven Amendments have been enacted to protect these Rights.  The Second Amendment is just one of the twenty-seven.  It is merely a means to an end, not an end in itself.\n\nIt is painfully clear that these Rights are being blatantly violated, especially those of our children.  We must find the courage of our forefathers, and dissolve the obvious cause., 9 Parkland's students refuse to allow themselves to be the collateral damage you describe. They are emerging as the most courageous and charismatic voices in the country. \n\nDon't give up on the kids. They need us now. We cannot let them down. We cannot be prisoner of our own disappointment. Don't let vanity get in the way of love. , 9 There are simply too many guns out there already, gun control and gun but back that worked in other countries are not likely to work here.  Instead of gun control, we may try ammunition control. If there\u2019s are no ammunition\u2019s for AR15\u2019s sold in this country, we will have rendered AR15\u2019s useless. , 9 We compose a nation that seemingly is looked downupon by many if not most because of the d issue.\n\nIf Connecticut did not effect reform, then it is futile to change.\n\nIf I have any insight that helps reform, then I should offer it publicly\nrather than to wife only.\n\nI fear many things, and civil unrest is a major fear.\n\nWe are afraid of internal destruction, and that means me and ye.\n\nThat is reality as I subjectively perceive reality. \n\nGuns are part of our DNA, so to speak.\n\nWe fear violence, we obtain guns, pepper spray et what have you.\n\nOf course these phenomena including fears are not politically-socially correct, and e I am running-in where angels fear to tread I\n\nIn our naked city- nation e, we exist in jungles of paranoia, don't we?/, 10 Our MADNESS on the subject of guns..., 10 I would agree limiting the 2nd amendment is a good idea but Im not sure it\u2019s a feasible solution.  I think you greatly underestimate the level of passion gun owners have for their guns.  Not all these people are republicans, many are democrats so I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a solely a Republican problem.  When was the last time Nancy Pelosi gave an 8 hour non stop speech demanding government action on gun control. When was the last time Shumer shut down the government over this issue.   \n\nThis isn\u2019t a problem with a single party, this is an American problem. \n\nWe are a violent country.  Start by looking at our military spending. Look at our military engagement oversees.  Look at our movies.  Look at our video games.  Millions of Americans tune into the super bowl every year even though we know the sport is killing a percent of these men.\n\nAs a nation we\u2019ve internalize this as normal and until we accept it\u2019s not normal we won\u2019t solve it.  School kids in America need their own #blacklivesmatter movement, a million people need to march on Washington.   Protestors will shut a city down over a single cop shooting but nothing for a school shooting.  (I\u2019m not minimizing BLM, I\u2019m just drawing a comparison). Sure, we will hold a candlelight and pray things get better but it\u2019s just time before the next one.  , 10 Bret, I totally agree with you.  The Constitution of the United States now, via the second amendment, sanctions the slaughter of Americans.  We are everywhere increasingly at risk to die from gun related attacks.  Logically, then, we should repeal the second amendment.  A new amendment could read something like this: \"The second amendment is repealed.  Federal and state jurisdictions shall pass necessary laws and regulations to protect the safety and welfare of citizens within the borders of the United States.\"  \n\nAlas, that is not likely to happen.  At least not until hundreds or thousands more of our fellow citizens die in mass shootings.  Very sadly, many more of our children will be slaughtered before we recognize that the second amendment no longer fits 21st century America.  \n\nSo, what can we do in the interim?  How about repealing the federal statute that prevents liability actions against gun manufacturers?  We can bring suits against other manufacturers who sell dangerous products or defective products.  Why not gun manufacturers?  It seems to me we would begin to see more and more gun safety introduced if gun manufacturers were held accountable for selling dangerous products.  That alone may be enough to stop the slaughter.  At least it would be a beginning.  , 10 Maybe we need to pass a KLASS act\nKeep Learning And Students Safe\n1. Ban sale and ownership of assault style weapons and high capacity cartridges for all weapons\n2. Raise to 21 age to purchase a gun anywhere in the USA\n3. Mandatory background checks, notarized in the case of gun show and private sales\n4. Eliminate all restrictions on lawsuits for damages for misuse of guns of any type and instance., 10 On this ONE issue, I agree wholeheartedly with Bret Stephens!  I appreciate Mr. Stephens's willingness to take a principled stand against the conservative gun madness, (fueled by truckloads of money from the Big Gun Industry.)\n\nIf gun enthusiasts are going to insist on their extremist interpretation of the 2nd Amendment, (and completely ignore the first 4 words of that amendment: \"A well regulated Militia\") then it is absolutely time to repeal the 2nd Amendment and replace it with commonsense regulations on these deadly weapons., 10 Let's pick the gun issue apart a little bit. According to Pew Research, 90 percent of all gun owners claim they own a gun for protection or recreation. 48 percent claim protection as their top reason. Let's take a look.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there are about 2 million serious violent victimizations per year. That works out to about 7 victims per 1,000 people age 12 or older. Meaning you have a 0.7% chance of experiencing a serious violent crime as of 2016.\n\nUnless you carry a gun with you on a nearly permanent basis, chances are the only location you'll ever be in the same place as both a gun and a serious violent crime is your home. According to the BJS, most people aren't even home when a burglary occurs. Only about 28%. Of these, only a smaller number ever experience violent crime. Also, most burglaries are committed without forced entry. The owner leaves a door or window open. Finally, homeowners are significantly less likely to experience a burglary than renters.\n\nAdd all this up and the situation is pretty absurd. The odds of a homeowner being home during a forced entry, experiencing a violent crime, and responding to the threat with a firearm are so ridiculously long as to be nearly worthless. Yet, protection is the number one reason Americans own guns. You're probably better off with a good lock on the bathroom door. America is paying an awfully high price for someone's security blanket.\n\nI won't start on recreation here., 10 The devil is always in the details, especially knowing that too often regulations lead to an unintended outcomes.  \n\nBroad statements such as keeping guns \"out of the hands of the mentally ill\" sounds reasonable and actually a very good idea.  Yet, who has ever in all of these demands attempted to define \"mentally ill\"?  The only definitions are in terms of \"mentally ill people like XXX (fill in the name of the current shooter)\".   What most of these individuals had in common is the use of antipsychotic drugs.  \n\nAccording to The APA:  \"The use of psychotropic drugs by adult Americans increased 22 percent from 2001 to 2010, with one in five adults now taking at least one psychotropic medication, according to industry data.\" And more shockingly: \"The investigation of foster care programs in five states found that hundreds of children were prescribed multiple psychotropic drugs, including antipsychotic drugs at excessive dosages. (http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/06/prescribing.aspx).\n\nAmericans may not be as unbalanced as they believe but Big Pharma is happy to medicate them anyway.  What if it is the side affects of the drugs that are the bigger problem?  Studies show psychotherapy to be far more effective than drugs.\n\nDrugs however, serve to make it all better NOW - make me happy, make my kid behave or make the senior patient compliant.  This culture of convenience takes away from the patients who truly need help. , 10 Bret Stephens doesn't make this suggestion because he's blind to the political difficulty of achieving it, but because he rightly recognizes how the NRA has twisted the 2nd Amendment.\n\nThe NRA isn't a gun rights organization--it's clever marketing to wrap themselves in the flag. It's a gun industry trade group, whose sole purpose is to aid the industry in selling more guns, to anyone and everyone they can sell them to, no restrictions. This is the role any trade organization plays for its industry. The big difference is their good fortune that gun ownership was written into the constitution, and in vague enough terms that they could spin it into what it's become today, and foster a gun culture now boiling in paranoia and action hero fantasies.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine that if any other industry had these constitutional protections, they'd also use them in ways the Founding Fathers never could have predicted all in the name of maximizing sales.\n\nGun rights arguments are now the height of intellectual bankruptcy: \"Bad guys ignore laws, so why have them?\", or \"You can kill a person with a rock, so we'd have to ban rocks, too?\" or \"There are too many guns now, so too late to do anything about them\" or the crown jewel \"Giving MORE people MORE guns, without restriction, is the key to LESS gun violence.\" Nevermind the experience of the rest of the developed world.\n\nWhen faced with that mentality, repeal makes sense, even if it's politically impossible (at least for right now).  , 10 When a majority of the states have passed guns restrictions as tightly as the second amendment and Heller allows and would like to go further, then it will be time to talk about repealing the second amendment.  , 10 Readers suggest: jerry-rig the 2nd amendment, interpret it correctly, enforce what is there, legislate around the amendment. These are all half- measures, nothing more than a new coat of paint on a rotting, crumbling structure. \n\nRebuild the structure to 2018 realities and codes. Interpretation attempts to de-code syntax, punctuation placement and linguistic intent will never work because \u201cinterpretation\u201d is precisely the problem.  Imbedded in language written in 1791 are the cultural meanings and conditions of that era.  The same words today may have vastly different meanings. Furthermore, we will never know the precise intent of the authors of the 2nd amendment and the words they chose. Nor could we ever expect them to be omniscient and prescient regarding the future.\n Therefore, repeal the original and write a contemporary version in clear transparent language, so there can be no interpretation issues, no confusion about the meaning.\nReaders who have suggested that the 2nd amendment is really about the American myth are absolutely correct.  That myth concerns the meaning of \u201cfreedom.\u201d Gun advocates perceive freedom as restricted to the realm of the individual, to property rights. Such a view is anchored in an abstraction, an unrealistic ideal that has limited practicality in a diverse modern society.\nIn 2018 we need practical strategies that serve a tangible end focused on societal health - not legislated myth that sacrifices collective well-being for the sake of a few., 10 While I would be perfectly fine with repealing the 2nd Amendment, there is a less radical solution:  Stop pretending that the \"well-regulated militia\" clause isn't there., 10 Crises in America and Trump takes yet another vacation, on the guise of addressing the school shooting.\nHe diagnosed the shooter as mentally ill, and chastised teachers, students and neighbors for not turning in the former student shooter---- yet Trump personally---as one of his first acts as president-- rolled back the specific Obama-era regulation that made it harder for people with mental illnesses to purchase a gun. And Republicans were complicit in passing that legislation.\nAnd walking on lawns and standing with people, he's giving a ridiculously inappropriate thumbs up sign and grinning like a Cheshire Cat. , 10 \"well regulated\" - Congress has all of the latitude it needs to regulate the sale and possession of firearms, 1% Republicans know they cannot win without the blood money of the NRA - defeat them in November, 10 our soulless and cowardly Congress has decided that guns are more important than children, 10 You will not repeal the second amendment without civil war.  Non-negotiable. So forget it. The NRA also has a 60% approval. \n\n When are you partisans gonna stop ignoring the real issue?  This had to do with every system that we had that should have gotten this kid help including the FBI but failed. \n\nWhen a person gets to the point where murder is the only solution we have failed.  We need to be focused on preventing this  Not hyper focused on how they carry it out.  You could have just as easily used a semi or a machete or a bomb.\n\n You are 5 times more likely to be stabbed to death in this country then shot by an AR15. \n\n You're more likely to be murdered with a hammer than an AR15. \n\n Please tell me what gun law gets this kid help before he decides to murder people? \n\n This has nothing to do with guns but people can't look outside of their own partisan politics. \n\n You will not take away the rights of the other 99% that follow the law and remove their personal protection's. \n\n The right to bear arms is as much of a right as voting is a fabric of democracy. \n\n This piece is Pure anti-American. \n\n We've fought one war already for the right to bear arms and we will do it again if necessary. , 10 I've no love for gun toting \"right to bear arms\" nutcases and even less for the NRA. The intent of this piece is well intended and well documented but the solution of abolishing the Second Amendment amounts to propose amputating a toe because of an infected toe nail. Several of the responders here note that the issue is not the Second Amendment but the willingness to exploit its ambiguous wording with regard to forming militias. Clean up the language and don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. , 10 I appreciate Mr. Stephens' perspective.  While I am not a conservative,  I respective the genuine conservative tradition that Mr. Stephens represents.  He calls out both democrats and republicans for their absurdity.  In this case, it is the Republicans.  And let's face it, the modern GOP has little to do with conservationism.  The GOP of today has more in common with Russian oligarchs than it does with Locke or Buckley.\n\nGuns are an example.  The GOP is owned by the NRA.  So much so that we can't get common gun control approved - even limited gun control that the vast majority of Americans support.  Instead they offer us the usual \"thoughts and prayers\" as they count up their NRA campaign donations.\n\nWe will move on from this latest tragedy and nothing will happen.  Instead the lives of these children will serve as a reminder to casual observers the world over of how a once great country was hijacked by money and slowly died before the eyes of its citizens., 10 Hard to imagine this repeal ever happening. But here is what must happen: Citizens fed up with the carnage must vote. Vote for candidates who favor strong gun laws. Stand up to the weapons manufacturers and their terrorist front, the leadership of the NRA. , 10 Completely agree. If people want to own muskets, we can start a trade-in program. , 10 We all know that it takes years and cooperation across the aisle to create and pass a Constitutional amendment, but we have an immediate problem, like NOW.  The proposal, while well intentioned, is just kicking the can down the road.  The dysfunction in this Congress is the consequence of each Congress-person wanting perfection to get his or her vote.   That unwillingness to give an inch was demonstrated in the recent bills on immigration; four bills in one day, and none could muster 60 votes.  A bill to alter the Second Amendment would be DOA.\n\nGun safety and control is much harder than DACA for much the same reason.  Perhaps what is needed is a Grover Nyquist for gun control, an anti-Wayne LaPierre.  Gabby Giffords's husband, Mark Kelly, comes to mind.  That leader should focus on the facts and give the issue unrelenting coverage: Do you want to kill school children or not?  Do you want bump stacks or not?  Do you want to prevent mentally impaired people from having guns or not?  A concerted effort should be made to force individual members of this Congress and the next to sign on the dotted line, to put up or shut up, to declare whether they are primarily partisan or primarily patriotic.  And the press should give gun control and the anti-Wayne LaPierre undivided attention., 10 Why propose something that will never happen. Is that really productive. Also you are not trying to solve the problem, but at most limit the carnage.  All guns kill. Alot of carnage can be done with a shotgun, pistol or rifle.  Let me ask what is an acceptable number of kids to die. I say one is too many but talking about banning a particular gun deals with the number killed.  Also what is worse a kid being killed at school by a mass shooter or a kid being killed by an illegal immigrant. The illegal immigrant should not be in the country., 10 Repeal the second amendment.Thank you\nYes.Start now., 10 I am happy to see 828 comments already on this topic. Most of the commentators agree that the Second Amendment needs to have a debate at least whether this belongs to this century. Why should we allow weapons like AR 15 for self- defence or for hunting? School children are getting killed because of this stupidity, this is not happening in any other country., 10 Americans do not need to cancel the second amendment. All they have to do is read the whole sentence, not just that part after the comma. Then they realize that the amendment refers to a specific circumstance. Two centuries ago the country did not have a big enough regular army to protect it, and volunteers were perhaps needed to come to the aid of the nation. \n\nNow that circumstance no longer exists, America now spends on its armed forces as much as the next eight countries and it no longer has to worry about King George trying to get the colonies back. , 10 I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the argument in this column. My husband says it will never happen, that there are too many guns already in circulation, that those who see their guns as a talisman or token of their identity will never sell them or give them up. But I think of so many changes I have seen at 62. Eleanor Roosevelt once wrote to a Civil Rights leader at the end of the 1930's that Franklin could do nothing about lynching, that for the North to send marshals would feel to the South like an invasion; a little girl walked to school flanked by U.S. Marshals 30 years later; my gay friends in this deeply red state are out of the closet and going about their business and from what they say mostly unmolested; Northern Ireland is not without conflict, but at least the terrorism has been stopped by mothers who said no more.  We will never have a time where we will not have to struggle to do what is right. And perhaps, when we come out of this polarized time, we can listen a little better to each other. Full disclosure: my has guns and likes to shoot them, but he has no problem with registering them or being responsible for them in terms of liability if he left them unsecured), 10 Were any of these mass killers members of the National Rifle Association (NRA)?  I can remember no news report which reveals or even mentions this possibility.  When profiling those who might have tendencies toward violent acts, might not membership in the NRA play a part?, 10 It should not escape notice that we are kowtowing to the addictions of the GOP base and their suppliers be they in the NRA, Oil, Medical Insurers or Pharma. The triumph of ignorance., 10 Perhaps it's time to pass laws consistent with the second amendment permitting people to carry guns in the Whitehouse and Congress., 10 Guns don't kill people.  Men with guns kill people.  The problem is the combination of men and guns.  Restrict men's access to guns.  Women aren't committing mass murders.  , 10 No need to repeal the Second Amendment.  Let's give everyone a gun: a MUSKET.  , 10 Imagine if there was only one eight year term for senators and one six year term for congressmen and women.  Retirements could be staggered every two years so governing wouldn't be disrupted.  This would solve so many problems. The NRA and other lobbies would lose much of their power because no one is running for reelection.  Money in politics would be a fraction of what it is now.  Legislators would vote their conscience instead of their reelection odds and they wouldn't be spending an inordinate amount of time raising money and campaigning.  The incentive to gerrymander would even be lessoned because politicians will be less concerned with keeping their parties in power when they know their exit is fixed in time.  \n\nKeep imagining because it isn't going to happen and sadly neither is the repeal of the second amendment.., 10 Case well stated, sir., 10 The 2nd Amendment doesn\u2019t need to be repealed, it only needs to be read. Gun Rights Activists only know \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d But the part that comes before (the comma is there for a reason), says \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State.\u201d Well-regulated. Militia. Security of a free State. There is nothing there about unfettered rights to weapons of mass destruction.\nIndeed, every right is limited: Religious rights don\u2019t enable Satanists to hold animal sacrifice; libel laws and national security laws, truth-in advertising put limitations on speech; the Patriot Act tramples 4th Amendment, and Republicans know full well the obstacles they put up to voting rights, in violation of Equal Protection.\nAnd though there is a Constitutional right to an abortion, Religious Right (amazingly, same people who want guns everywhere!), find ways to block, making clinics inaccessible, the procedure too expensive, mandating time.\nThere is no need to \u201cfix the Constitution\u201d to install commonsense gun regulations. There already are regulations on guns. Clearly they need to be improved, including banning assault weapons, limiting ammo capacity, requiring universal background checks, banning bump stocks, RESTORING Obama-era limits on mentally ill acquiring guns that Trump & Republicans removed; requiring licensing & national registration; taxing purchase of guns & bullets for victims funds., 10 Bless you for writing this. It is far past time for change. I view both the NRA and \"there's-nothing-that-can-be-done\" politicians of both parties, as being complicit in murder. This country has a serious sickness and it's time for some real legislative medicine. , 10 As a Conservative from rural Nebraska, living in a Liberal area of the East Coast, I've often asked myself if there is any issue so polarizing that it could cause a 2nd Civil War. The only issue that comes to mind is guns. Liberals just don't understand how much of a symbol the Second Amendment is for rural Conservative Americans. This is a bold prediction, but I predict there will be armed uprisings if the Left finds a way to repeal the Second Amendment or limit it's scope via litigation. If Liberals come for our guns, we will fight back--but at least we'll be armed., 10 \tBret Stephens is right. Repeal of the Second Amendment would clear a lot of the rubbish out of our debate on gun control.\n\tTwo of the ten Bill of Rights amendments emerged from the very different circumstances faced by the Founders and should not be sacrosanct. The Third Amendment, for one, assures us that soldiers will not be quartered in our houses without our consent\u2014a \u201cprotection\u201d that has been obsolete at least since the Civil War.\n\tThe equally antiquated Second Amendment allowed citizens in an unstable post-revolutionary society to keep muzzle-loaded,single-shot muskets for the purpose of assembling local militias. The Constitution should no longer apply this anachronistic protection to our far more deadly personal arsenals. Some gun laws belong in the hands of the Congress; others are better left to the discretion of states and localities\n        At the federal level, Congress, free of constitutional challenge, could require universal background checks and ban assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, which should be available only to the police and the military. But if, say, Florida chose to enact an \u201copen carry\u201d or \u201cstand your ground\u201d law under the illusion that more guns equal fewer shootings, it could do so, provided that Miami could ban all handguns, recognizing that they are the weapons of choice for most street criminals and that homeowners are far more likely to shoot themselves or their family or friends than to deter a home invasion.  , 10 We need a single gun control organization to go toe-to-toe with the NRA.  I'm sorry to say that the multiple well-meaning grassroots organizations are not cutting it.  The primary organization I have in mind would be well organized, well funded, loud, generous, and relentless.  Match the NRA dollar for dollar on political contributions.  Publish a list of scores.  Flood the media before an election with ads reminding of mass murderers.  Tailor the message in different areas.  There are minds it will never change, so work on the other ones., 10 Guns are going to go at some point. It may not be soon, but they are going to have to go. Fewer families own guns than ever before. Only a small percentage of people actually own guns, and their numbers are dwindling steadily.\n\nMore and more people are being negatively affected by gun violence. The public will not tolerate this much longer, and the more murders that occur, the more people are convinced that guns must be banned. \n\nHobbyists and silly militia boys are going to have to find something more constructive to do with their time. Their pleasure in shooting and killing will not be allowed to take precedence over everyone else's pain. , 10 \"It\u2019s true that a gun in the right hands at the right time and place can save lives, as the former National Rifle Association instructor Stephen Willeford proved when he shot Kelley as the latter emerged from the church. No sensible society should want to keep arms out of hands like his.\"\n\nWait a minute.  Did I read that right?  The author has praise for the NRA?\nThe author just provided a reason to not repeal the second amendment and is pretty close to what the NRA says.  No sensible society should want to keep arms out of the hands of a lawful, conscientious citizen who knows enough about guns to be a gun safety instructor for the NRA.\nI have a better rational solution to this conundrum.  A government-private organization cooperative to teach gun safety to legal residents of this country.  Guess where this safety training will occur?  The same place they teach driver's education and sex ed, in the schools.  The government partners with all sorts of private entities to benefit the citizenry, like faith based initiatives, public health programs, Get your flu shot!, etc.\nLook up your statistics.  How many mass murderers, criminals, shooters were NRA members?  What would be your objections to that?, 10 Billboards needed her- front of U.S. Capitol:\nAmericans killed from guns 2014-2017:   56,755\nAmericans killed from guns 2017:            15,590\nMass Shooting so far(since Feb 15):                30\nWith counting this year from gun violence\nthen- - Thanks for visiting--come again!, 10 Repeal the second amendment, indeed.  The second amendment is the root of all the gun violence Americans experience.  It's beyond time to put a halt to it.  Remember Sandy Hook., 10 The author fails to point out that in each of the cases she highlights the murderer had sever mental health issues. We do not have a gun problem in this country. We have a mental health and society issue along with an issue with liberals who want to blame an inanimate object instead of the person who committed the murder. We also have an issue with liberals who are cowards and unwilling to defend themselves or their families and who feel threaten by those who do. We have a problem in this country with liberals who have no idea or respect for what the US Constitution means. It also amazes me that each and everyone of the legislators who espouse this nonsense has armer security for themselves and their families, but not regular American citizens. Those same politicians are in violation of the very oath they swore to support and defend the US Constitution., 10 The Second Amendment's \"well regu;ated militia\" was designed to avoid our needing s standing army, and occasionally was used to put down insurrections  like Shay's and the Whiskey Rebellions.  The NRA has convinced many, up to some Supremes, that the purpose is to create private \"militias\" to defend against the tyranny of the Federal government.  The last upsurges of that were \"the great slaveholdrs rebellion\" (aks the Civil War), and the KKK's putiing down Reconstruction.\n\nWe just need to remember the Amendment's original purpose., 10 Bret: the thoughts are appreciated but the responsibility here lies with politicians charged with regulating the militia.  When the GOP gets paid by the NRA to do nothing (Marco Rubio), then no change is in the offing even if 20,000 of our kids are slaughtered by one of the 300,000,000 guns inside our borders in the next five years.\n\nWhat is needed is for folks to stop electing hacks who do the NRA's bidding at every turn.  Changing the Constitution is an impossible pipe dream and we Dems and liberals need to stop dreaming and start acting.\n\nVote the GOP OUT!  Now!, 10 Repealing does nothing to take the guns out of the hands of shooters and in any case is not politically possible. Another effort to divert people from taking action. , 10 Sir...\n\nPlease do one of two things:\n\nHave your senators and congressmen place legislation before both houses to implement a repeal.  Or, \n\nDevelop a movement to petition the state legislatures to convene a constitutional convention implement a repeal.\n\nIf you aren't willing or are unable to do either of the above, you need to sit down and shut up until such time as you are capable of getting such a measure introduced.\n\nYou risk exposing yourself as one who is not willing to pay attention to that which is possible in favor of emotional blackmail in a vain effort to achieve by stealth that which you cannot achieve through the ballot box and/or legislation.\n\nThere are far too many OTHER pressing issues for which consensus is achievable for you to continue to swing at a pi\u00f1ata that is so far above your head as to be unassailable., 10 I just wish more Americans knew how their country started, works, and functions. The scariest thing by far in our nation is the blatant lack of education that people seem to be proud of for some reason., 10 In the present society, there can be no necessity of lethal weapons in the hands of the citizenry. We have had no incidents where a citizen with fire arms has saved these types of mass murders! The usual mantra of the Republicans that a gun in every hand would save themselves from harm is a myth. In fact there have been many instances of children being killed by family owned guns! Studies after studies have shown that more guns means more killings. The only way to get out of this killing field is to either repeal the 2nd amendment or modify it to the original intent of a \"well regulated militia! No background checks will decrease the spread of these weapons in the hands of a population, that is anxiety-ridden and with politicians promoting anger & hatred to win votes and an NRA profiting from this phenomenon!, 10 Yesterday, I read the article about the school shooting in Florida. I was thinking about it a bit later as I saw a trailer for a new movie that had an attractive young lady (Natalie Portman?) aiming an assault rifle at an unseen assailant. No doubt, she plays some sort of persecuted hero who must kill a lot of people to save the day.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t need to own a gun have no problem asking those that do to give them up. But what if I asked you to stop supporting entertainment (video games) that promotes violence? Would you be willing to do that? It\u2019s more likely that we choose to create a solution that causes no sacrifice in our own lives.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to blame these shootings on violent entertainment. But it plays a role. If you simply focus on the gun issue, you are only addressing the tip of the iceberg. Our handling of mental illness plays a role. Our 24 hour news channels that exploit these shooting for big ratings, feed the need for attention that these shooters crave. This is a cultural issue and the solution is a lot bigger than a constitutional amendment.\n\nAnd for those of you suggesting that who we elect to Congress has a bearing on this, please stop. You are embarrassing yourselves. Those people, Democrats and Republicans alike, have no allegiance to voters. They support whatever their benefactors tell them to support. Are you absolutely certain that your Democratic candidate does not accept any money from the gun lobby, either directly or under the table?, 10 Cheryl Wheeler made this very same case in her 1999 song, If It Were Up To Me.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Op7agdIFOGY, 10 As a retired 40 year history teacher living in rural Minnesota I read with great interest the comments found here.  The commentators for the most part appear to be an intelligent, but are coming from a very naive group.  This is especially evident when you talk of repealing our 2nd amendment.  Most of you are I must say are a HUGE part of why the 2nd amendment will NEVER be repealed.  Your ignorance of what the vast majority of your fellow Americans who live in our rural \"Flyover Land\" think is obvious. Many of you are why Trump was elected and is likely to be reelected for a second term.\n\n Its just a suggestion, but try and do what you can do.  Get certain types of assault rifles like the AR-15 banned or their sale rigidly controlled.  Get the sale of high capacity rifle clips that hold more than 12 rounds banned.  Enforce the gun laws we currently have and increase the penalties for criminal use of firearms.  Get more stringent mental health testing required for EVERYONE.  Testing of all types is often a requirement for many jobs these days. Get the FBI to do it's job.  I went through extensive background and mental health screening to get my teaching position.  Make mental health and drug testing a requirement for ALL employment.\n\nMost Americans are ready to make meaningful changes. Changes can and SHOULD be made in America.  But repealing our Second Amendment?  As my dearly departed Dad would say if he were here with us today,  \"son, you are peeing into the wind.\", 10 So commonsensical! Love all your ideas and how those pesky facts you cite sure do speak louder than the thousands of innocents massacred and mowed down by the gun lobby mentality, which is so clearly wrong. Thanks for explaining it so nicely to those who will not hear because they've got earphones on and mental problems they don't want to look in the mirror and do the work of dealing with. So many American men act like they're in total denial!, 10 If they want to follow an 18th-century rule, let them do it with 18th-century firearms.  Using a muzzle-loader will certainly slow them down., 10 Thoughts and prayers. I despair of anything more being done.\n\nThough not an evangelical I may also quote the literature: \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\".\n\nThe treasure of many Congress members stems from the NRA. Q.E.D., 10 The NRA and ANYONE who thinks owning a military assault rifle that has only one purpose....to kill people...need to do two things:\n\n1. Point to even ONE instance where one of these weapons was used in self defense. \n\n2. Speak to the families of these dead kids and explain why your \"right\" to own these monstrosities is greater than their children's right to live.\n\nUntil they can do BOTH, they are hypocrites and coward., 10 Our constitution is a fluid document. That's why we have amendments. The 18th amendment was a mistake and was repealed in 1933. The 2nd amendment has been bastardized by the NRA/gun lobby, whose definition of arms includes military grade assault weapons, a far cry from the muskets used when that amendment was adopted in 1791. The GOP controlled congress repeats its worn mantra that \"Now is not the time\" concerning discussing sensible gun control legislation. It begs the question \"When is the time?\" because the GOP will most likely respond \"Never.\" The students in Florida who mourn for their fallen siblings and friends have it right. Forget about congress praying for the departed. We can't wait until the next carnage to take steps to prevent it. If protecting innocent and vulnerable children in schools is not a sacrosanct bipartisan mission, what is?, 10 How about we let people own guns but make them have insurance for any\ndamage done in their illegal use?  We do that for cars, why not guns?\nIf that were the case, some insurance company would be on the hook for\nthe value of 17 lives and all the other injuries involved.  Our vaunted capitalist\nsystem is supposed to be good at quantifying risk, and so the cost of insurance would in all likelihood be much higher for an assault rifle than for a hand gun bought for self defense. Let the markets sort out the cost to society of gun ownership and let those who own guns bear that cost., 10 The Second Amendment is not likely to be repealed because the red states that are pro gun will not support such a change.  It might take another generation or two to get enough momentum to actually change the constitution and even then it is unlikely., 10 There is one comment a while ago that an obviously pro gun individual posted in a Breitbart comment section, that only dictatorships take away guns. This made me think that our forefathers's foresaw the only way to prevent a totalitarian government was deterrence through the citizens having fire power. Now as we know this isn't true as the are plenty of developed nations governing their citizens respectfully without needs for the citizens to have guns, but it did make me ponder the worst case scenario. That being said, most of the super conservative gun nuts have developed this fearful perspective of a government as an oppressive power instead of in service to its people. Deterrence through strength has always been a disturbing trend of conservative politics and public opinion. Are guns truly the last stop gap to prevent a government subverting itself to be totalitarian? Was, or is that ever necessary? , 10 Mr. Stephens,\n\nYour desire echoes mine, but the extreme right and left of national opinion will unite in crying foul if the necessarily armed police and military try to disarm civilians, who in turn will hide their firearms. The only solution I see is mandatory education., 10 Repealing the Second Amendment will take a mass action - larger than the Civil Rights Movement or the Women's' March.  If young people can organize and take to the streets, maybe that will get enough older Americans to come out and support them.  It will take a younger generation to create enduring change., 10 Stephens is right.  This is not a hard problem to understand.  The U.S. rate of gun violence (no other developed democracy comes even close) can be substantially reduced only one way:  Very strict controls on access to guns, especially guns and ammunition that is really only useful for military purposes.  \n\nBut it is a hard problem to solve.  \n\nEnforce our current laws?  Sure.  But that won't solve this problem.  Not even close.  More guns for 'good guys'?  Read the column.  It will stop some mass murders, but overall lead to more deaths and crime, as some of the 'good guys' end up being overzealous vigilantes, have bouts of depression and use the gun at hand for suicide, or sell their gun to a 'not good guy.'   Besides, very few really want to live in a world where everyone is open carrying all the time, and where every child has to go through a metal detector every morning at school.  \n\nAll other nations have been able to prevent mass gun violence.  Restrictions on ownership of guns is a necessary ingredient to how other nations have done it.  , 10 I know it may take awhile, but one of the things that has worked for the gun lobby is that most Americans have not been  impacted by gun violence.  Gun violence in the inner cities is  not new.  Like drug addiction and overdoses, the average American never cared about the inner cities.  Only when these problems spread to the suburbs did it really get viewed as something that needed a solution.  So now the average American IS affected by gun violence.  And they can see the solutions aren't limiting immigration or rounding up illegals or taking your shoes and belt off before boarding a plane.   And with 300 million guns and the way it has been handled so far, the result is more gun violence in more areas that heretofore were \"immune\" from it. The current \"solutions\" of more guns in more places and more security has accomplished what, exactly?  More tragedies and more deaths and more communities impacted.   The consequence will be more and more and more  Americans who want it to stop.  And unless someone has a bright idea to reverse the trend and to get people to stop buying guns to purge their demons, they will demand change even if it means stepping on the constitution to get that change.  Sorry, pro second amendment folks: time's up.  Time to admit your solutions have failed.  Miserably., 10 If we can't repeal the 2nd Amendment, there are at least a few other reasonable things we CAN do that would help reduce gun violence.\n\n1-Require a license to own a gun. Require a test to demonstrate basic knowledge, like getting a driver's license.\n2-Register all guns. My car and dog are registered, why not my gun? Without a registry, how would you know if that man with a restraining order owns a gun?\n3-Require gun owners to purchase gun insurance. My home and car are insured, so if they cause injury or damage to another person, that person can be compensated. Why not guns?\n4-Stop protecting gun companies from lawsuits. Why do they deserve special protections that other manufacturers don't have?\n5-Institute a gun buy-back program. This can get many illegal weapons out of the hands of criminals.\n6-Reform campaign finance laws to reduce corruption so fewer of our political leaders are owned by the gun lobby.\n\nThese are very reasonable steps that have been taken in other arenas. Why is it so hard to get things like this done for guns? (oh, yeah...see step #6), 10 Rifles for hunting, OK. but there\u2019s NO good case to be made for owning a handgun for self-defense. Statistics show that owning a handgun increases the risk of your being killed by a gun, and increases the risk that someone in the house will be killed by a gun. Those who claim otherwise are ignoring the facts and indulging in movie-inspired fantasies. Being able to hit what you aim at in the middle of a rapidly moving, heart-stoppingly tense confrontation is something that law enforcement officers train continuously for, and often enough even they miss.\n\nBut it's already too late. The non-response to Sandy Hook shows clearly that we as a nation have decided that daily killings of children are a reasonable price to pay to preserve the right of anyone to purchase dozens of lethal weapons., 10 Maybe we need an originalist judicial intrepretation of \" A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\".\nI do not see how this wording justifies allowing any person to buy an arsenal at a weekend gun show.  , 10 There is no need to repeal the second amendment. The second amendment was written with only one dictionary in existence and the definition of militia and arms meaning professional military and weapons of war. The second amendment is not really open to legal interpretation it is clear and concise. The second amendment is about the newly established nation to maintain its own military to protect its sovereignty., 10 Good luck to you as you tilt at the windmills of the Republican mind. Clear, concise, and well argued, so not a chance.\nClimate change? Trickle down economics? Russian witch hunt? Very stable genius in the white house? What makes you believe that this issue is any different? Dead children? O captain, my captain, that fearful ship sailed a long time ago. Thoughts and prayers. MAGA, 10 The politicians who you expect to repeal the 2nd Amendment are the same people who can't ban bump stocks or halt the sale of a gun to a person on the terrorist no fly list. Good luck with that., 10 Or follow Chris Rock's suggestion, raise the prices bullets! Put a massive tax/tariff on bullets, say $25 per bullet? Its a totally crazy idea I know.....but this whole situation is totally crazy., 10 First published after the Las Vegas massacre, maybe it is wise to republish this after each massacre, and keep count. , 10 Ultimately it looks like the promise and reality of NRA donations is way more powerful than the death of children of constituents that legislators do not personally know, 10 There are anti-tobacco ads that show people in their death throes after suffering from lung cancer.  Do we need to show autopsy photos of children ripped apart by assault rifles with the caption, \u201cIs this what the founding fathers intended when they talked about a well-regulated militia?, 10 There is absolutely no defense or justification for allowing automatic weaponry. Hunting with such guns is butchery, not sport. One doesn't need such guns to protect a home. I believe all guns should be banned, but I would be willing compromise with a ban on automatic and assault weapons.\n\nThere was a ban, once upon a time. It was one of the first laws our hypocrite president rescinded when he wrenched power from the hands of intelligent, thinking people. And now he is bloviating about protecting our children in school. His remarks border on the obscene in light of his actions.\n\nThe NRA stupidly refuses to acknowledge that automatic weapons do not belong to anyone as a right. They refuse to acknowledge that banning automatic weapons does not impinge the rights of people owning hunting rifles or guns as protection. If we can't ban automatic weapons, can we at least ban the NRA?, 10 Parkland survivors: tell us what we can do to support you in your activism! Lead the way. I am sorry the adults have not led the way, as we should have done, but you are nearly adults, and so you must. Tell the nation what we must all do to support you not just in your recovery, but in your political activism!, 10 \"The Obama administration tried to do that after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre by requiring the Social Security Administration to submit the names of severely unwell persons to the F.B.I.\"\nIt was unconstitutional and the killer wasn't on Social Security.  , 10 Let us consider \"the facts.\"\nThere was exactly ONE armed security guard to protect a 43 ACRE campus!!   Why is that?  Because our \"educators,\" particularly in Democrat dominated areas are SOOOO offended by the sight of a gun that they WILLING sacrifice the lives of children so as not to see it!!\nWe need to be more like the Israelis whose teacher have shoulder strapped weapons on them as they enter the school building.\nThe end of another myth.  Approximately 75% of all \"death by guns\" are suicides!!  Think somebody suicidal is going to let the lack of a gun stop them?, 10 If we can not get the simplest gun law regulations past, how do you think the repeal of the second amendment will ever happen no matter how many people are killed?\n\nPerhaps there is a simpler solution.  Allow the carrying of guns in Congress in every state and do away with security checks in airports.  There is a reason this also will never happen.  Guns are dangerous weapons and those in Congress know it.  Until Congress people are directly threatened on their home turf they will never protect the nation.\n\nMaybe we should have mental health tests for those we elect including Donald Trump., 10 Without repeal/reform of the Second Amendment sometime soon, it's difficult to see the logical endpoint of gun ownership in the US.  This conversation needs to reach a much broader audience, now.  The notion that a citizen of ANY country has the right to own a military-style assault weapon is so far beyond the pale, it makes the head spin.  The references made by our representatives that this is about mental health is a complete joke, beyond obfuscation into insanity.  The NRA and the gun manufacturers should pay for the buy-back of the weapons upon which they have become billionaires and perhaps subsidize the families who are still paying medical bills for loved wounds wounded or slaughtered in mass shootings.  A modicum of justice for shattered lives.  , 10 We have, as a people, been comfortable amending the Constitution as time and needs changed within our culture. Clearly there is a strong groundswell of young support for looking at this issue more critically and the data supporting harm for our current practice is overwhelming. \n\nWe have grown past counting persons with different ethnic background as partial-persons-- surely we can evolve past the need to provide military-grade firepower to masses of untrained, mentally unstable persons. Britain has done so and they do not seem to be groaning under the yoke of oppression., 10 I have new hope when I read about the Parkland survivors' anger and speaking out. Everyone said, if nothing will change after 20 first graders were murdered, then nothing will ever change. But the difference is that the survivors of Sandy Hook, who are now mostly sixth or seventh graders, were too young then and are still a bit too young to speak out, though of course their parents did. But these are actual survivors. Perhaps this really is the turning point? Shooting high school students, who are nearly adults, mad enough not to take it anymore, and soon able to vote and organize politically? I am hopeful. Perhaps they will join forces with, say, the Columbine survivors, who even though they are nearly a generation older, will be newly energized by younger survivors' passion and anger. Although the Columbine kids were high schoolers, after Columbine it really was too soon - the nation was shocked, traumatized, no one knew what to do, and the survivors had no sense of being the latest victims in a long history of horrors, as the Parkland survivors do., 10 We will see no action on meaningful gun control so long as Congresspeople feel they are above the fray - that indeed they are rewarded for their antisocial behavior.  Maybe gun laws will get some traction in Congress if all elected officials are stripped of their security details.  All they need is a concealed carry permit to protect themselves.  , 10 In an act of judicial legerdemain In the Heller case, decided by a 5-4 opinion, Antonin Scalia wrote out of the Second amendment the words \"a well regulated militia,\" in order to give a virtual unfettered right to bear arms. This decision has been roundly criticized by American historians seehttps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/guns-have-always-be...  and not justified even under his theory of originalism.  As the article points out, since the Heller and its counterpart McDonald, the supreme Court has refused to take up another case, wile allowing the Highland Park Ill. statute barring assault type weapons to stand after being upheld by the Seventh Circuit. After Australia in response to a mass murder shooting,banned  assault type weapons over two decades ago they have not had a similar incident. Thus, it is clear if we have the will legislation can be passed to begin to reduce the likelihood of another Parkand Florida mass-murder and the Supreme court would not dare strike it down. The problem is our legislators in DC do not have that will. They are a profile in Cowardice., 10 You don\u2019t have to repeal it.  Just keeps radical judges off the courts and adhere to the previous 250 years of precedent., 10 You've been criticized, ostracized, and vilified from day 1 Mr Stephens, but I say this: This is your best written, opinionated column since \"coming aboard\". Great job!, 10 The author objects to purchasing 33 firearms in a year, but that doesn't really make anyone any more dangerous that purchasing one firearm in a year. You can't shoot 33 weapons at a time. It may look scary to have a bunch of weapons, but you really can effectively shoot only one weapon at a time. So, unless the person who purchased 33 firearms was equipping a private militia, who cares?  , 10 Only 10% of AR-15's have been used in mass shootings and the 2nd Amendment is not outdated our founding fathers were very big on it's the people's country and we needed to be armed to keep it that way. History has shown us what happens when the government takes away your guns and America is different than all other countries so stop comparing us to others when it comes to firearms . For the people who want more gun laws just remember the FBI failed big on the Las Vegas Shooter and the Florida high school shooter so let's give them more laws to fail at.The government can not confiscate 300 million plus guns just like the left tells us we can not deport 11million illegals, the bad guys will still have them and we won't . Decades ago we had more powerful guns than the AR-15 so why not all the mass shootings like now , maybe video games and movies and kids are not taught to respect weapons like before ,kids are brought up today not knowing what failure is so when it happens they snap . Why does everyone blame the object and not the person ,alcohol destroys many more lives than guns do so why no discussion on banning alcohol makes sense since it's destroying so many lives . Killers will find a way to kill., 10 WE don\u00b4t understand why the 2nd amendment was not repealed in the 19th\ncentury.  It reads, as anyone might check, \"A well regulated Militia , being\nnecessary to the  to a free   State, the right of the people to keep & bear Arms\nshall not be infringed.\"Do we not have a Militia now & Is it  not well-regulated ? , 10 Agreed! Repeal, then rebuild the Second. Write new language and policies concerning gun sales, ownership and registration and make them clear as glass. Ban weapons with a high cyclic rate of fire, which clearly are designed only to kill as many human beings as quickly and efficiently as possible, along with the high-capacity magazines that feed them and other weapons, such as semi-automatic handguns. That kind of equipment belongs only in the hands of the military and police. \u201cBecause the law says I can\u201d has never been a sensible reason for gun bullies to possess them. So change the laws. THAT would be meaningful action toward truly getting this horrific problem fixed. I\u2019m no across the board gun grabber. I like taking my 9mm to the range, and my shotgun is a comfort for home defense, even if I\u2019m not sure I could bring it into play at 2 a.m., since I also need to keep it secured. But I would gladly register both guns, and/or comply with laws restricting the amount of ammunition I would be allowed to buy, or even give them up, as long as any such laws were applied evenly and fairly. The country has a horrible problem! It won\u2019t be fixed without sacrifice, including on the part of the people of questionable intelligence who insist that owning an AR-15 is a God-given right., 10  The partnership between the Republican party and the NRA is the most heinous in American history. In exchange for political support and campaign contributions the GOP sacrifices 90 American lives per day , over 30,000 per year. The Republican party and everyone who votes for them  should be ashamed., 10 The second amendment is just a pretext, and removing it would change nothing. If it were rewritten to make owning a gun punishable by imprisonment, maybe that would help. But it ain\u2019t gonna happen. \n\nKristoff\u2019s recent article \u2018How to Reduce Shootings\u2019 [ https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/opinion/how-to-reduce-sho... ] lays out some effective measures with data supporting them. They might be more widely implemented, but the incapacity of voters to recognize fact as fact is a fact., 10 \"Repeal the Second Amendment\" - Amen. It will happen. It will happen. It will happen. I don't know when, but some day, I hope within my lifetime. It will happen. An entire country gone insane either recovers, or it doesn't, and continues to allow its children to be wantonly murdered. So yes. Repeal. It will happen., 10 \"Maybe the Parkland massacre will shame the majority (GOP) into embracing the legislation\" that would \"make it easier for family members to help keep firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous relatives.\"\n\nMr. Stephens: you're a funny guy., 10 Lawyers and politicians have failed to effectively protect America's children from assault rifles.\n\n     Mostly, because assault military grade rifles trauma is a medical problem.\n\n     Congress might want to gather experts in Emergency Medicine, First Responders, Trauma surgeons, trauma nurses, and have these actual experts in caring for these school massacres present their findings on live television in the halls of congress to the American people.\n\n    The American Medical Association, our Police, and the American Academy of Pediatrics is on record about assault military grade weapons of war, that the NRA has flooded   on our streets, and paid heartless Republicans vast sums of money to stop physicians. The prescription is simple: Stop the sale of these military assault rifles, clips, and bullets to civilians.\n    President James Madison did not mention allowing individuals to own military grade assault rifles in the Second Amendment in the Bill or Rights. Let the Supreme Court get off its rear end to make a judgement on the Constitution's views of arming mentally ill white boys, as part of the second Amendment., 10 Mr. Stephens,  I know you love to present yourself as a sensible  conservative, but once again you've displayed your own ignorant ideology.  The problem with the Second Amendment is that recent NRA- inspired interpretations, even by some self-styled \"originalists,\" have been historically absurd and contorted.  The phrase well regulated militia in no way guaranties, or even implies,  gun ownership rights to individuals.  The firearms in common use when the Constitution was written were muskets and single-shot pistols, time-consuming to reload and prone to misfiring. The Framers couldn't have envisioned the mass-produced semi-automatic weapons readily available to today. , 10 As one commenter cited, from Justice Scalia:  \u201cWe also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller (an earlier case) said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \u201cin common use at the time\u201d. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons\u201c.  \n\nI believe that gun ownership should be allowed, but assault style weapons should be banned.  Specifically, any weapon that can be modified to function in a fully automatic manner (bump stocks) and capable of using extreme capacity magazines.  Any weapon thus modified would certainly fit the description of \u201cdangerous and unusual\u201d.  Magazines for civilian weapons should be limited to 10 rounds although, personally, I would prefer 6 rounds.  (Force mass murderers to reload more often thus giving someone time to intervene.)  Also, you can\u2019t drink until you\u2019re 21 but you can buy an assault rifle at 18??  Absolutely ridiculous and stupid.  As long as the GOP controls power, none of this will change.  They\u2019re very well funded by the gun lobby.  Rise up and vote.    , 10 By repealing the second amendment and getting rid of guns (except for hunting and sport shooting and a gun locked up in your house and being mentally sound and no automatic rifles and no open carry or concealed carry ) thousands of lives would be saved each year.  Isn't that worth it ? And if you think you need a gun for protection against the government think again.  The $$ spent for weapons systems would make your gun totally impotent., 10 The interpretation of the Second Amendment has always been stupid. First of all, a plain reading of the amendment shows that it applies to members of the militia, whatever that might be. Probably the National Guard. Anyway, members of the military no longer have to bring their own guns to the fray like they apparently did a couple of hundred years ago. The government does that. That pretty much wipes out any need to allow members of the militia to own guns. Let's get up-to-date here and save a lot of lives. , 10 Repeal of the Second Amendment is pie in the sky. It's an easy position to take because under the Constitution's amendment process it will never happen. Meanwhile, Governor Scott of Florida, cited by Stephens as wanting to take guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, has also demanded the resignation of the Director of the FBI for that agency's failure to pursue a tip about the recent murderer's mental state. That stance - blame Washington, I'm running for the Senate - says more about the \"gun debate\" than do radical suggestions such as amending the Constitution. Before that happens we'll have metal detectors at every school (and church, and mall...), strip searches, \"open carry\" by neo-Nazis, and bodyguards for the rich. More realistic than Stephen's position would be a reinterpretation of the Second Amendment at the Supreme Court: not likely with successive Republican presidents, but possible if non-scoundrels get elected to the presidency and appoint common-sense justices., 10 There is no evidence that Stephen Willeford saved lives by shooting Devin Kelley outside that Texas church.\nKelly it seems had pretty much run out of people to kill., 10 Repeal the Second Amendment? So you are wanting more deaths? You do know repealing the Second Amendment results in a second civil war. , 10 The second amendment cannot be repealed.  It is one of the inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.  The Bill of Rights does not grant these rights to U.S. citizens, it simply enumerates them., 10 There are 2 difficult problems relating to solving gun violence by restricting gun ownership:\n1. The Constitution states in the Second Amendment: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\n2. There are millions of semi-automatic weapons already held by the public.\n\nSo if you believe that the first problem makes it impossible to ban all guns despite the part about militias then let\u2019s look at what it doesn\u2019t say. It doesn\u2019t guarantee a right to discharge arms. So the government could ban the discharge of any firearm of any sort except under regulated circumstances.\n\nFor the second problem the federal government could immediately ban the sale or transfer of any semi-automatic weapon. They clearly have the power to do this as they do it for other weaponry. \n\nAny violation of either of these would result in prison time and confiscation of all firearms at any premise lived in by the violator. , 10 Agreed. Repealing the Second Amendment does NOT mean a ban on guns. It means we empower the local, state, and federal governments to enact sensible legislation to restrict what firearms and ammunition people can obtain, how many they can obtain, and who can obtain them. The voters of these various constituencies can elect people they trust to enact reasonable restrictions, and they can decline to elect people they think would enact restrictions that are too restrictive or not restrictive enough. What they would NOT be frustrated by is the position put forward by the NRA, namely, that any restriction at all is impermissible., 10 Where are the \"originalists\" and \"strict constructionists\" who so revere the language and intent of the Founding Fathers when it comes to the Second Amendment? Why do you suppose the authors of the Constitution made a deliberate choice to refer to a well-regulated Militia when guaranteeing the right to bear arms? Unless this is given serious consideration, then there can be no productive debate about guns. I think the most productive thing that could happen would be an amendment that provides an ironclad guarantee against future confiscation for any citizen who abides by rules that acknowledge the need for  keeping some kinds of weapons out of the hands of some people. I keep reading that the majority of gun owners believe in reasonable regulations, but the most rabid among them fear confiscation above all else. I think we could put this to the test with a clear and carefully crafted change. It might take one or more generations to have full effect, but wouldn't it be worth it?, 10 Why in the world would you want to get rid of an Amendment that clearly says that guns must be \"well regulated\"? Anyone interviewing pro-gun Republicans needs to simply ask them what \"well regulated\" means to them. I'd love to hear them try to answer., 10 Why not allow interpreters of the 2nd amendment, like NRA,  to let US citizens own machine guns, bazookas, grenade launchers, even tanks if they can afford them...after all when democracy is in danger, that is the type of weapons that will save this country ?\nThat is precisely what happened in Lebanon and the 1975-1990 fratricidal war killed 10% of the country's population (150,000 citizens), 10 Vote out every Republican on the ballot this year. Every single one. Their enabling of Trump and corruption by the NRA are toxic to American democracy and fundamental human decency., 10 The 2nd Amendment is about the American people being sufficiently armed as to be able to fight a an oppressive government.  Are you completely confident that Donald Trump will step down if impeached, or even when his term ends?   He continues to hold the door open for repeated Russian interference in our elections.  Republicans have accepted all other forms of despicable behavior in order to remain in power--gerrymandering, nepotism, voter suppression, false propaganda, discrimination, tolerance of sexual assault and deviance.  Are you positive that they won't take the last step of ignoring an electoral outcome?  The 2nd Amendment could be the only thing that stands between freedom and a Russo-Republican conservative police state in this country.  Isn't it merely unlikely, but not impossible, that they would encourage Fox and Breitbart push an election conspiracy theory to their base, and use that to freeze themselves in power?  Haven't they already done the former?  The follow through is not impossible.  This horrible, but clearly possible, turn of events is what the 2nd Amendment is for.  And if you think that an armed populous could not successfully fight our modern Army, I would refer you to the Vietnam War, as well as the mujahideen in Afghanistan.   Control handguns, take guns away from criminals and the mentally ill.  But don't repeal the 2nd Amendment.  Our government has not earned that level of trust--much the contrary., 10 If the rightwing hadn't put into force entirely wrongheaded legal interpretations that contradict both the words and intent of the amendment, it wouldn't be necessary to repeal it. As it now stands, the Second Amendment is a false idol and its worshippers are unwilling to wake from their delusion. So yes, Repeal!, 10 But if we ban owning of guns in large numbers, what will happen to our arms industry and millions employed there?\n\nIf people cannot own guns, who will pay their dues to the NRA and what will happen to the people who run the NRA?\n\nSo when you propose doing away with the second amendment, please keep in mind these poor souls who will become unemployed.\n\nYes, there is much gun violence and people do seem to get killed unnecessarily, but is that such a big price to pay for keeping these poor souls employed? Think about that., 10 Thank you Bret Stephens for sounding an alarm for Republican politicians to stop cloaking themselves in the Second Amendment, and act responsibly and morally. Last February,  Donald Trump and the Republicans in the Senate and House passed a bill making it easier for people with mental illness to purchase guns such as the semiautomatic weapon used by the mentally ill teenager in Parkland ,Florida. In essence, Senators Chuck Grassley,  Marco Rubio, Representatives Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy did all they could possibly do to put a military grade weapon and 30 shell magazines into the hands of a mass murderer. They deliberately chose to prioritize putting a lethal weapon in the hands of a very disturbed teenager, who is not yet old enough to legally buy a beer, over the safety of schoolchildren, worshippers,theater and nightclub attendees. Their actions are tantamount to serving as the Parkland shooter's co- conspirators.\n Governor Rick Scott is equally guilty of permitting the slaughter of innocent children and teachers. It is clear he learned nothing from the Pulse nightclub massacre.\nAfter all the mass murders ,the carnage, the killing of so many innocent people, all they offer are empty, robotic thoughts and prayers.  Not one of them has had the courage to say, I am sorry for failing you. I am sorry  I continue to support mass murder in the United States. I will resign for my failure to keep you safe from this slaughter., 10 In the US people love their guns more than they do their kids, their neighbors, their co-workers and friends. We have a national sickness. There is only one cure., 10 Also, let's be honest. Does the NRA really care about the people or the Bill or Rights? No, they care about their own money and power. They have found a great business in selling guns and raising money from their members. They want to grow their business by any means possible. The tool they have used is the 2nd amendment, which they have exploited, manipulated and corrupted. I give them credit for developing an outstanding sales pitch which relies on fear. Fear that the boogie man will come to get you (the minorities) and that the government wants to confiscate their guns. So you better be armed and ready when they do. These are of course lies, but when draped in bald eagles, American flags, personal freedoms and the like, it's very compelling. But as Adam Gopnik writes in the New Yorker, \"[The NRA] has accepted as a matter of necessity the ongoing deaths of hundreds of children as they price to pay...\" for their political gain. Our kids dying is the price of continuing to grow their business. That makes them culpable in my view. It's so wrong. Please vote out the NRA puppets. , 10 I'm curious why California repealed possession of a stolen gun a felony and made it a misdemeanor? I thought the Liberals wanted to be tough on guns. It wasn't conservatives who did that yet everyone here seems to blame them. Why did they also pass Prop 47 releasing criminals by the thousands? Reducing intentionally infecting someone with HIV to a misdemeanor? Why allow convicted illegal alien criminals to stay in the state and kill innocent people? Could that be why so many Americans want to own a gun? Could it be because so many Liberal mayors and governors are more intent on protecting criminals than law abiding citizens. The more migrants, illegal aliens, and criminals, that Liberals coddle, the more likely we will see more people wanting to possess guns. Since there is no legal requirement police protect me, then I'll protect myself. And I'm trained to do it. If you're intent on owning a gun, you should, at the minimum, attend a months long course as police do. Perhaps that would solve your dilemma on possession of a firearm. And treat gun crimes severely. Not the way Liberals treat crimes. Illegal possession of a gun? Mandatory 10 years. Let's get serious and not take away Constitutionally protected rights. Or next the Left will be clamoring to take away or First Amendment rights.... Oh wait... They already have been. , 10 Those of us who grew up with Columbine are now running for office., 10 Here is another reason to get rid of all of the guns: they are killing more of our children than ever before, but not from homicide. From 1980 to 2015, despite a 25% percent increase in the child population, the death rate among children 5-14 decreased 50%. We are doing a better job of keeping them safe as the number of deaths by accident has plummeted.  The corresponding number of homicides also decreased from 419 to 298. However, they are killing themselves like never before, mostly by the guns they find lying around the house. The number of suicides increased 300%, from 142 to 413. The numbers for children 15-24 are similar: the death rate decreased 40%, with the homicide rate decreasing 40% (6500 to 4700) while the suicide rate increased from 5200 to 5500.  50% of suicides occur by guns. These discussions about whether or not it is acceptable in a civilized society to allow people to obtain an AR-15 with greater ease than a fishing license are beyond absurd. The NRA and those who support them are a scourge. However, the greater danger to our children is all the well-meaning and frightened adults who buy a gun to protect themselves and then come home one day to find that their depressed and confused adolescents had taken their handgun and blew themselves into forever. , 10 Perhaps, as a slightly outside-the-box approach, we could ban the flow of money that goes to politicians from all outside sources, which might eliminate the NRA's major influence in this area (as well as a host of other unseemly quid pro quo activities on the part of our elected officials). Provide all candidates with an equal amount of campaign financing from tax dollars, and let the best person win, rather than the richest. Unrealistic at best, but a fun thought., 10 Repealing the 2nd Amendment would remove the barrier to and provide the basis for more restrictive gun controls, perhaps even allow the banning of certain types of firearms. But at this point in our political evolution we might as well be wishing for unicorns and fairies. As long as armament manufacturers see the United States as the only viable open market for their products they will continue to fund the NRA which, in turn, will continue to fund politicians willing to sell their souls and the lives of our children in order to remain in power. This calculus is simple, obvious and has nothing to do with constitutional rights, mental illness or the rate of violent crime.\n\nI cannot think of a single social crisis we are confronting in this country that is not exacerbated by the unfettered political contributions of special interests. Our problem with gun deaths will not be solved until we rebuild the system of representation so that it works for the interests of its citizens. Anything other than this is merely treating the symptoms of a corrupt construct that will use its resources to blunt any attempt at diminishing its influence. Get the money out of politics and we have a fighting chance at replacing the NRA's congressional caucus with representatives at least willing to address the gun problem. Don't repeal the 2nd Amendment; repeal Citizens United., 10 Bravo.This is a political problem. We need to elect citizens who have the political courage and moral fiber to stand with the people of the United States and not against them., 10 Prior to the conservatives taking over the Supreme Court and rewriting history, the Second Amendment was never interpreted as granting a personal right to own firearms. So much for original intent and textualism...\n\nUntil the Republican Party is effectively smashed and completely rebuilt, and ceases to be the captive political instrument of exclusively wealthy interests, we\u2019ll continue to suffer the economic consequences of such travesties as the recent tax giveaway to the wealthy and their corporations, the joke of the \u201cinfrastructure plan\u201d (that\u2019s nothing but a veiled strategy to effectively sell our public roads, airports, seaports, rail, transit and water systems to private investors), and the continuing carnage resulting from our obsession with, and excessive access to, firearms. , 10 Yes but impossible.  Much more plausible/effective path: majority of US citizens take control of congress 2018; that majority takes the White House in 2020; new majority of senators removes filibuster rules; congress, in its constitutional authority, changes the number of Supreme Court justices from 9 to 13; the new President appoints four new supreme court justices who use common sense, original intent, and rational thought to interpret properly the second amendment and overturn Heller v. District of Columbia  and others.  New congress and state legislatures pass reasonable gun control laws that mirror those in Australia and other civilized countries.   BTW- new SCOTUS also overturns of Citizens United and other democracy destroying decisions.  Sounds like court packing? Breaking with accepted norms?  Please discuss point with Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) - soon to be former majority leader.  This is what taking back our country would look like., 10 Don't repeal the Second Amendment - rewrite it to insure our rights as citizens to be protected from harm, assaults, violent attacks in our homes and any public setting, especially our nation's schools. Ask the kids at any of the schools where mass shootings have occurred what they think. Several brave students are demanding change. It's time for us as responsible, voting citizens to listen to the kids. Demand bold, legislative action that includes rewriting the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cA well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d \n\nThese words no longer make sense. Tragically, since 2012, what makes sense is the reality of 239 school shootings, the huge loss of lives from which families and friends will never recover; the insanity of the public response to buy more guns; the culture of fear that has replaced the original intent and meaning of the words \"right,\" \"security,\" and \"free State.\", 10 WE ARE NOT POWERLESS\n\nThe 2008 Heller decision does not prevent gun regulations, nor does it protect automatic weapons. It ruled only that a total ban on possession of a handgun (and only a handgun is addressed) in the home was unconstitutional, as such a ban runs afoul of the \"in common use at the time\" prong of the 1939 Miller decision. Since handguns were and still are in common use, their ownership is protected. \n\nHowever, regarding M16 rifles and the like, the Court specifically added that \u201cas we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home.\u201d Automatic weapons were not and still are not \u201cin common use\u201d: therefore their ownership is not protected by this ruling.\n\nIn addition, regarding the regulation of firearms, the Court added: \"Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms . . . or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d\n\nSince the June 2008 Heller ruling, over 80 different cases have been heard on the constitutionality of a wide variety of gun control laws enacted by various legislative bodies, and most were upheld. Even if Congress won\u2019t act, state legislatures can! , 10 It is time to call out everyone in the halls of Congress supported by the NRA.  I wrote to my three representatives, Senators Burr and Tillis and Congressman Pittenger, republicans all and all supported by the NRA.  One replied, Tillis, who cited the same tired arguments that Mr. Stephens has written here.  Come November there should be a voter uprising against all standing for election who are supported by the NRA to send them home from DC for good.  That good being the safety of all  of us., 10 \"A Well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\". Let's take a closer look...when the 2nd Amendment was ratified, the US did not have massive standing armies and did need \"well regulated militias\" for national defense. Those days are long gone. Imagine the shock and disbelief of the founding fathers were they to see an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, an M-1 Abrams tank or the carnage of Las Vegas. In 2018 America, the only 'well regulated militias\" are the reserve branches of the armed forces along with the National Guard. Gun rights advocates constantly cite \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\", but they are taking it out of context. Try this one: \"It would be horrific to say that child molestation is acceptable\", and someone turns around and screams, he said \"Child molestation is acceptable!\" It's time we form an organization to counter the NRA. this morning I registered the domain www.usgvp.org    United States Gun Violence Prevention.  Are we going to stand up to the NRA and their captive politicians or are we going to walk away and do nothing?  The next mass shooting is likely only months away. We must act quickly. , 10 It's no longer the 18th century, save in the conservative mind., 10 Just out of curiosity, will you then consider demilitarizing Officer Friendly? I see no good reason for my local constables to traipse about with machine guns, grenade launchers, armored cars.\n\nJust asking, mind you., 10 We amended slavery and male suffrage out of the constitution. We can amend an unlimited right to own out of it. Put it back to the states and cities to set their own laws. Get the feds out if it. , 10 There are 300 million guns in the hands of Americans and you have an almost zero chance of getting them out of the population.  Shrill commentary advocating the impossible is nonsense.  You might as well advocate for government research into time travel to go back and right the wrong.  In fact it is derelict to waste your voice on such.\n\nSome things that should happen though:  First and foremost, kids need to be taught and drilled on how and when to fight back.  In every classroom and at the hands of every kid are weapons in the form of desks, chairs, backpacks, books, computers, that need to come sailing as hard and fast as possible at these bullies.  You can't shoot when you're ducking.  Everyone needs active shooter training and drilling on how and when to fight back because it is the only option in the face of these incidents.  If you don't believe me, look at plane hijackings since flight 93.\n\nTwo, train and arm able bodied individuals, teachers, administrators and classified employees.  \n\nThird, pass legislation that enables the long term hospitalization of individuals who make these threats.  Put them away until they are deemed no longer a threat to society.\n\nFourth, ban violent video games - get rid of them - we have no need for the fallout.\n\nLastly, the legal age for owning an AR type rifle should be 21 - the same age as a handgun., 10 Unfortunately, most people assume that the second amendment gives one an absolute right to possess guns without even reading the awkward and ungainly prose that constitutes the second amendment.  This is what it says:\n\n\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nArguably, this can be construed as meaning that one has the right to bear arms if one is in a militia that defends the nation.  This can support a right to bear arms collectively among others who are defending the US; this does not seem to suggest that one has the right to bear arms as an individual for personal purposes.  If the framers wanted to give us an unqualified right to handguns, why did they find it necessary to include so much language -- and at the very beginning!-- regarding a \"militia.\"\n\nAlso, the amendment states that the militia shall be \"well-regulated,\" and this suggests that the govt. can enact regulations, such as rules forbidding the mentally ill from possessing guns.  \n\nIt is true that the Supreme Court has said that the 2nd amendment affords a right to bear arms.  However, Supreme Court views change. (In 1986, in Bowers v Hardwick, the Supreme Court said that the constitution did not afford a right of sodomy; the Court reversed itself in Lawrence v Texas in 2004 or 2005.)\n\nIt is absurd that people who never analyze the actual text assume that the 2nd amendment mandates constant carnage   , 10 Repeal the Second Amendment??  That's never going to happen.\n\nRepealing the Second Amendment is always the first knee jerk reaction of OP Ed writers whenever a gun related tragedy of this magnitude occurs.  Does Bret Stephens really think that Southern and Western states where guns are a cherished way of life are going to go along with a repeal effort. Not a chance.  In many Southern and Western states schools close on the first day of hunting season!!  Evidently going into the woods to shoot helpless animals is far more important than getting an education.\n\nAnother thing everyone conveniently forgets is that our founding fathers didn't want big professional armies like the hated redcoats.  The real purpose of the Second Amendment was to establish a citizen army where ordinary people would have their guns ready to respond in times of a national emergency.  The founders never envisioned we would have such lethal automatic guns -- they lived during a time when soldiers  had to stop and reload their guns after each shot was fired.  \n\nIt's time that Bret Stephens and the rest of the Times OP ED section climbed out of their ivory towers and got a good hard look at what America is really like outside the New York tri-state area.  You'd be in for a rude awakening, that's for sure.  That's why the Second Amendment is  never going to be repealed., 10 By never offering meaningful solutions or crafting politically possible compromises, it is possible that the NRA,  its rabid adherents (not by any means most gun owners) and craven Republicans have created the environment where the 2nd amendment will eventually be repealed. They will blame \u201cliberals\u201d but it will be their own fault. , 10 We don\u2019t have to repeal the 2nd Amendment, we just need to read it. Read Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent. Everyone, most everyone, in Switzerland has a gun. Why aren\u2019t there mass killings there? Everyone is a member of a \u201cmilitia\u201d a \u201cwell regulated militia\u201d so everyone knows the proper use of a gun, crazies can\u2019t have guns, they know the difference between a hunting gun and a military gun. My cousin-in law returned to Switzerland every year to perform his two weeks of service; i.e., military maneuvers. And history is so easily forgotten; in the late 1800\u2019s when people came into old west towns the sheriffs, the likes of the Earps, the Masterson\u2019s checked their guns. Nobody complained to them about the Second Amendment. This country has more guns per person than any other country in the world,  the next country after us is Yemen with half as many per person! And having a gun does not necessarily protect you. A police officer in Chicago was killed, he had a gun. The husband and wife in Texas a coupl e of years ago who had a gun in every room and carried a gun; shot and killed. What we need is the American people to stand up; do what they did about there health insurance - get in the eyes of their legislators. Stand up to the NRA., 10 Amen. The age of well regulated militias in America is long gone, as should be the Second Amendment., 10 There is not one good rational reason for the Second Amendment to be on the books in 2018., 10 Paul Ryan's \"let not act too quickly before we get all the facts\" treats this like a one off. We have ample evidence that there is a trend, that we have made it easy to kill each other, that we have not kept our children or ourselves safe. Can we fight the 2nd amendment thing later and, for now, shift our perspective to what is safe? Above all, don't let statements like PR's go without challenge. It's an insult to our intelligence. Every parent knows this is a ploy to keep us all at bay so that the status quo remains intact. How's that status quo working for the folks in Florida, Texas, Newtown, Orlando, Las Vegas......?, 10 Repeal and replace Second Amendment. , 10 I agree with Brett that the only solution is a second amendment repeal, either by an amendment to the constitution or a more liberal SCOTUS that overturns Heller by interpreting the amendment to apply to militias only.  I just wonder how many dead murdered children it will take to being the American people to the same conclusion.  , 10 Your understanding of the effect of the Second Amendment on gun regulation is as wrong as it could possibly be., 10 Of course what's standing in the way of a Second Amendment repeal is Stephens's own political party. Didn't another party already think of that? And universal healthcare and free public college? Oh right--Democrats., 10 In the pre-Freudian times of the aftermath of the American Revolution, \"well regulated\" meant \"sane\". Custody of deadly weapons is not a God-given right., 10 I'll agree to that, when you agree to eliminate the right to free press.  Didn't think so.  I believe in the second amendment as much as you believe in the first.  Now rethink your argument., 10 I was an NRA member and a Bar 9 sharpshooter by the age of 14.  I put down my gun and never shot it again.  What, after all, is the point (I have yet to get a coherent answer from any gun owner)?\nMore than guns themselves, the problem is the mass mental illness that IS manifest as the gun culture in this country.\nI repeat: rabid gun ownership is a mental illness.\nUntil we get rid of all semi-automatic and automatic weapons this will never, ever end.\nI am embarrassed for our country., 10 common sense coming from a conservative\ncolumnist! I have only one addition to his\nidea. let those obsessed with the second\namendment be forced to trade in their\nweapons for a musket.now there is something our founding fathers might have\napproved of., 10 It's time to put the \"Well-Regulated\" back into the second amendment., 10 You wouldn't need to repeal the 2nd amendment, just follow it more literally:\nSingle-shot, black powder muzzle-loader flint-locks only, & only within a well regulated militia.  No semiautomatic anything for anyone., 10 There is nothing wrong with the 2nd amendment. The problem is with the misinterptetation of it. Much of that misinterpretation is due to NRA propaganda that has deleated the first part of the single sentence amendment, \"a well regulated militia\", from the minds of many Americans. , 10 There were already 46 casualties, 26 of them fatal, in the church by the time Stephen Willeford got involved, and the shooter was leaving. We will never know if the shooter planned to continue his murderous rampage in another location. Perhaps Willeford prevented that from happening. But, the shooter took his own life, as they so often do, so we will never know. I would much rather that no one had AR-15s than have to pin my hopes on a unknown man with one, not sure whether he is the \u201cgood\u201d guy or the \u201cbad\u201d guy., 10 The Second Amendment does not need repeal; it merely needs to be read properly!\n\nThe Amendment consists of one sentence of two phrases couched in 17th Century British English. The first phrase states the objective: a well-organized militia. The second phase states the method: the right of the people to keep and bear arms. The term \u201cpeople\u201d implies a collective organization, such as local police department or a state national guard (militia). If the right were meant to apply to individuals, \u201cpersons\u201d, not \u201cpeople\u201d, would have been stated. (The Fifth Amendment is an example.)\n\nThe historic basis for the need to organize and arm local militia is well-known. In England, around the 13th Century, an evil King, probably John, fearing rebellion, decreed that only persons authorized by the Crown were permitted to keep and bear arms. Consequently, a village in Dorset was left defenseless against an invasion of dragons, or maybe it was dragoons, from Cornwall.\n\nThe rights of snot-nose teenagers in West Texas, and toothless moonshiners in Tennessee, to keep and bear AK-47s, is a preposterous misreading of the Second Amendment. Neither should it be read as denying an upright, sane citizen the right to keep and bear firearms appropriate for hunting, personal protection, and managing the food chain on his property. , 10 An episode of \"60 Minutes\" interviewed a feminist who had decided pornography is not protected by the 1st A. Had she gotten through somehow to ban porn, I could see the ban on free speech continuing on.\n\nThe constitution is a framework of what is considered natural rights. The wording was purposely made a little vague so as laws could be changed as the world changes.\n\n\"Shall not be infringed\" is very clear. It means don't mess with it.\n\nIf guns, or certain types were banned tomorrow, a tremendous industry and black market of 3D printed guns will come up. You'll wish the 2nd A. was still in effect., 10 Gun availability is the problem.  There will always be some trash talking threatening disgruntled person saying something threatening like probably every two seconds in this country.  The FBI can't investigate all these people or figure out who has a gun.  The NRAs experiment of guns for anyone is a failure and a nightmare.  Look at ur results. Compare to other civilized advanced countries.  Its obvious that this experiment is bad idea.  What would the writers of the second amendment think about the results.  This is not a \"well regulated militia\" but a free-for-all practically.\nProblem now is that millions of guns and assault weapons are now in circultaion, being handed down to children of original owners, sold person to person, gifted away, etc without any background check or waiting period at all.  Should we all now open carry everywhere all the time.  Where is this experiment in guns going.  How many more innocent people loose their lives for NOTHING. We don't have an invasion from a foreign enemy, we haven't had tyranny for 200 years and if the government wanted tyranny they would squash any resistance easily.  So whats the point of all these guns that people are dying for?    NOTHING.  Go tell that to the dead kids parents. , 10 Gun \"rights\" are about \"gun sales.\" Profits before people; that is what the \"grand old party\" party stands for. Demand that your local, state & national reps stand up to this profit driven group.\n\nMany of my generation (boomers) no longer have the idealism that we grew up with. Let's get back to that. Instead of getting old and putting your head in the sand, get involved and urge your representative to truly represent you and the majority of Americans who believe in sensible gun laws. We need to move forward, not retreat to the past., 10 There are thoughtful and successful models all over the world in how to deal with this scourge. Australia and Japan for instance decided that public safety came first and took action. Effective action.\n\nFirst on the list is ignoring the selfish cabal of fetishists called the NRA.  Your arguments ring hollow now.  The dead look up from their graves and wonder why nothing is ever done., 10 As was pointed out by Max Boot in an op-ed in the Washington Post, the 2nd Amendment was put in place when the prevalent firearm was a musket.  So quite possibly the 2nd Amendment gives everyone the right to own a musket and nothing more lethal.  (By the way, a musket is not terribly accurate beyond about 10 feet).  \n\nBut this whole business about the sanctity of the 2nd Amendment is a sham and everybody with ten cents worth of intelligence realizes it.  Clearly, it was put into place so that the nation could protect itself from invaders.  But now we have a $600 Billion per year defense department which renders the whole idea of the 2nd Amendment moot.  An amendment to the Constitution which once made sense, now has become a license to commit mass murder.  \n\nBut of course the gun crazies genuflect and solemnly bow their heads before the mere mention of the 2nd Amendment.  It is no concern of theirs that other people's children are dying en masse because of their fanaticism.  \n\nIt was time a long time ago to repeal the 2nd Amendment, and anybody who has an ounce of sense should demand nothing less.       , 10 \"Conservatives are supposed to be empiricists...\" Where did Stephens pick that idea up? Trickle down \"economics', paranoid carry a gun anywhere anytime laws, afraid that any second you'll be in danger, fearing an American army sent by the tyrannical Feds that you the brave tough gun owner will stave off, immigrants are ruining American life, Trump is a hero, etc., all very empirical, right?\nI suppose Stephens would say those fantasists are radical lunatic fringers, not conservatives. All I know, never has the right been the force behind any progress in human dignity and civil rights. How's that for empirical., 10 Outlaw the manufacture or possession of the .227 cartridge and every AR-15 becomes a paperweight., 10 America has a choice. Either EVERYBODY gets to own guns (including the \"mentally ill\") or nobody does. Malcolm X made that pretty. So, if you want your own weapon of mass destruction, then so much I have mine. THAT IS THE TRUE PRICE YOU MUST BE WILLING TO PAY FOR YOUR 2ND AMENDMENT ABSOLUTISM. Why should the \"mentally ill\" in America even begin to give up our rights if those people we view as more CRAZY that we who want to carry assault weapons be allowed to even contemplate such ownership without  mandatory psychiatric evaluation in advance and recurring ones regularly in future?\n\nIf you say I am crazy for other things, I say to you that your desire to own a weapon of mass destruction is a clear sign of mental illness. At the very least you should be required to see a licensed psychiatrist for evaluation before anyone puts an \"AR System\" into your hands., 10 Why isn't this called a terrorist attack ?\nIt doesn't matter the ideology behind it. The actions were that of a terrorist., 10 Better than repeal, enforce the Second Amendment. Anyone who owns a gun is a member of the militia. Well-regulate that militia. Make them muster., 10 You do not need to repeal the 2nd amendment, you only need a supreme court with members that  do not decide cases based on the RNC talking points peddled by fox and friends, Hannity, and others. Gorsuch and Alito are partisan hacks and Thomas is just flat crazy. If they were replaced by conservative but sensible judges like Souter or Kennedy, the right to own a gun would be vindicated but sensible gun laws would be possible. Assuming of course that the crime family known as the NRA and republican congress were dealt with., 10 Good idea, but if that's not possible, how about an edit: \"The right to bear 18th century, muzzle-loaded flint-locks shall not be abridged.\", 10 Thank you for your courage and logic. Coming from you, maybe more conservatives will listen. Prohibition did not work. The Second Amendment has not worked for years. Repeal and start over with sanity., 10 Good luck collecting the guns. You'll have a blood bath on your hands. \n\nCruz had a gun because nobody thought to enforce laws that do not allow mentally-disturbed people to have one. It's really that simple. Every time this sort of matter comes up we find that police and regulators failed their duty.\n\nCruz could have waited outside the school for it to empty out then run over 17 students with a car. Do you want to outlaw cars?, 10 \"That way lies the path to a Clockwork Orange.\"\n\nAlso known as Pennsylvania Avenue..., 10 Let's call the AR-15 and its ilk what they are:  Human Assault Weapons.  They have no place in civilian life.  You want to play with guns like that?  Join the military.  They'd be glad to have you.\n\nCongress at one did ban these weapons, even under the 2nd Amendment, and the law stood.  But cowardice prevented them from letting the law expire, and here we are.  , 10 Hillary didn't lose the election.  The NRA and Russia won the election.  \n\nAs a retired teacher, I can tell you that administrators do all they can to protect students from any disaster, but it's nearly impossible to protect the school from someone with a gun - especially an automatic war weapon.  We had plans, teams, exits, lockdown practices, portable toilets in classrooms, alarms - everything we could think of.  One dad asked me on the first day of school two years ago if I had a plan for my classroom if a shooter came down the hall.  I told him I would protect his daughter with everything I had, which would have been my own body.  \n\nI cry for our country.  We have distractions of extramarital affairs, sexual abuse, lying, praising communist leaders and communist sympathizers, hiring and firing of liars and abusers.  On and on.  This week it was about guns.  Guns!  Guns!  What?  We can't do anything about war weapons in the hands of citizens?   , 10 Nothing will change.  All the evidence needed for this statement is the fact that Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Cory Gardner have EACH received THREE MILLION DOLLARS in campaign contributions from the National Rifle Association (NRA).  A list of all the United States senators and the amount of money they've received from the NRA is available online.  No doubt there are an equal number of members of the House of Representatives who have also been bought by the NRA.  What a country.  You can't make this up. , 10 Repealing the second amendment will ultimately have to be part of the solution to this horror, but the initial steps toward a sane gun control policy will be political. We must make it politically expedient for the spineless politicians of both parties to work on effective gun control laws. Every town hall meeting, every debate, every political public appearance must be peppered with questions about gun control until these cowardly politicians realize that things are going to change. VOTE THEM OUT!, 10 \"Conservatives are supposed to be empiricists, not idealists. They should learn the lesson of experience.\"\n\nThank you, Mr. Stephens, for this uproarious belly laugh. \n\nThe Conservative-Republican cabal is the party that relies on \"fake news\" and \"alternative facts.\"  Conservatives blindly believe in religious doctrine (e.g. creationism), not empirical evidence (e.g. evolution).  Conservatives want us to interpret the Constitution as \"originalists,\" i.e. ignoring all the empirical knowledge that society has developed over the past 200 years.\n\nConservatism is all about keeping citizens in line as indoctrinated sheep, opposed to the free-thinking of Liberalism.\n\nThe only thing that Conservatives are \"supposed to be\" is whatever is decreed by God, or the Pope, or the Bible, their President, or their Dear Leader, or Jerry Falwell, or Breitbart, or Sean Hannity, or whatever some authority figure tells them that they're supposed to believe., 10 Mr. Stephens,\nI agree with you to repeal the second amendment. How do you do it? My suggestion:\n1) Monitor the money trail so that NRA is defunded to bring a moral sense and logical discussions among us. As you indicated all modern societies of other civilized countries did that.\n2) Ask the media for a strong campaign against deplorables (white nationalists and AR lovers - machine for mass killing)\nOur founding fathers are turning in the grave to see what is going on in the country with gun violence. They did not have a slightest idea that self defense arguments will turn into mass killing with advancements of technology and polarization of the society. NRA culture has to be discredited at any cost to bring any change in the country - not the prayer after each mass shooting by NRA hungry politicians., 10 If my child kills a person or people with his automobile I could loose my home. I am responsible for his actions. I have insurance umbrella to protect myself. Why can a child buy military assault weapons and his parents not be part of the deal? The gun store owners may have been legally in bounds but how do they sleep at night.\nCulturally we are all responsible because there has been plenty of time to stop it and we dither and let the NRA and their minions bully us into passive inaction.\nWake up! I agree Repeal the Second Amendment. At least be brave enough to talk about it., 10 I was born in 1936.  Most of the males near my age got caught up i the ever present westerns on the radio, and then on TV.  In the 1960s, there seemed to westerns on TV every night of he week.  I couldn\u2019t wait until I got my first BB gun, then a 22 rifle.   I joined the NRA and before Wayne LaPierre, it was a sensible org stressing firearm safety and resposiilty.  I bought my last gun, a pistol, at a gun show near Seattle about 35 years ago.  The seller accepted only cash, ad didn\u2019t even want know my name.  I thought \u201cgreat\u201d, don\u2019t even have to pay sales tax.  On the way home, it struck me that anyone with cash could buy a gun.  Thank heavens that situation no longer apples in my county.  I had since given all my guns away.  \n\nInstead of repealing he 2nd Amendment, why not use the opening phrase regarding a well regulated militia, I.e., requiring membership in the reserves or guard.  And of course, treat guns like autos.  Mandatory training, registration and insurance.  No assault rifles, limit concealed array permits, every firearm sold with a trigger lock.  That would still enable responsible hunting and target practice on regulated gun ranges.  No sportsman wants to be in the woods or fields with a nutty yahoo.  If we can\u2019t make the 2nd Amendment fit our current urban society, by all means repeal it., 10 We don't need to repeal the second amendment. We just need to stop interpreting it in absolutely crazy ways. But there we are again: back to the issue of mental illness. , 10 How can Stephens really believe that repealing the Second Amendment is achievable?  Luckily, all that's necessary is to redefine the legal boundary between firearms used for self defense, hunting and target shooting, and those used repeatedly in mass killings -- semi automatic weapons like AR 15.  If fully automatic weapons are illegal (and have been for a long time), the semi automatic ones could be as well.  What we need to prioritize is mass killings, and that is a more modest goal than the quixotic one that Stephens endorses.  , 10 All this talk about the Second Amendment is just another excuse for doing nothing. There are plenty of effective things that can be done without taking guns away form anyone. Here's one. Why don't we require gun owners to have liability insurance? Just like we do for cars, which also have the potential to hurt people and destroy property. Insurance companies can use their experience with automobiles to keep guns out of the hands of lunatics and careless people. They will have plenty of motivation to do so., 10 Starting over from the Second Amendment impasse is our best hope to stop the carnage and is also a pipe dream.  Congressional Republicans will never get behind such a measure.  Every scene of bloodshed shows how dirty their hands are.\nThe young lives snuffed out in Newtown couldn't get them to work with a president who wanted to keep that from ever repeating.  The massacre at Pulse nightclub, which was then our worst gun shooting, elicited shrugs that the killer would have still found a way (well, except for Trump, who fancied a template for barring Muslim immigrants).  Scores mowed down in Las Vegas, to date the biggest loss of life from a gunman, and it was somehow too early to look at regulations.\nUntil and unless the majority of legislators are out of the NRA's pockets, forget about any forward motion.  Insanity reigns when the gun lobby writes laws and buys mouthpieces., 10 Your proposal to repeal the Second Amendment is so ludicrous, especially coming from a conservative, it makes me wonder what your real motives are, Mr. Stephens.  Any sizeable movement in this country to repeal would have the effect of coalescing the gun rights crowd and the NRA around an even more extreme defensive position, if that\u2019s possible, and turning off any moderate conservatives who might have supported sensible gun control.  The chances of any compromise on gun control legislation would drop to zero.\n\nWhat\u2019s your game, Mr. Stephens?, 10 I can never understand the logic behind these types of articles. Why would outlawing guns work any better than outlawing heroin, or illegal immigrants? If 12 million illegal immigrants can sneak into this country, why couldn't illegal firearms be smuggled in? Would the people who advocate outlawing guns also advocate stricter border controls? I agree that outlawing guns might reduce the murder rate, but outlawing fatty foods or sugary foods would reduce the death rate even more, so why not do that? Or why not outlaw unnecessary driving? As far as mass murder goes, guns are very inefficient; bombs (Oklahoma City) or airplanes (9/11) are much more deadly if someone is really committed to killing people. Also, Stephens mentions the lower murder rate in NYC due to strict gun laws. But part of that policing strategy included 'stop and frisk', which was ended because it was 'racist'. So if we outlaw guns, how do we go about enforcing the law without being racist, or for that matter, sexist? It's no secret that poor people and men are more likely to commit gun crimes.  Gun crime has become a hot button issue, mostly because it sells newspapers, but as far as realistic solutions, I don't see any., 10 I think help is on the way.   I think the children in America's schools are coming to realize the adults have no answer.  There are the students in schools directly impacted  by gun violence.  There are their loved ones and the rest of the community in which the atrocity occurred.  Do you honestly believe their thinking after the tragedy is they wish there were guns all over the school? Hypothetically  we have an armed resistance in the schools.  All schools.  So where does an angry gunman go next to discharge their anger and their weapons after their first target is eliminated?  The mall, the city park, the Christmas parade?  Do you think these individuals scratch their heads and say :\" Ya know, maybe I'm just looking at this the wrong way.  Maybe I should get rid of my guns and ammunition.\"  And the funny thing about kids is they can relate to other kids.  And they are now coming to realize it could happen to them, if that thought didn't enter their consciousness years ago.   A funny thing about kids is they see how the adults handle crises.  I am sure they aren't reassured by Ryan and Rubio and Trump and all the others who offer false hope while more of their peers are gunned down.  And yet  another funny thing about kids is they grow up,have their own kids, and vote.  And a piece of advice to Republicans.   Read your bibles.  For the children shall lead them. Because you won't. , 10 In the meantime, restore severely to financial liabilities to equity and debt holders of the assets used in production, distribution, sales and demonstration of assault rifles and pistols.\n\nOnly when those who profit both the short and longterm of the murder of children feel the deadly financial fear equal to the physical fear of those children prior to their murder will this barbarous activity be terminated. , 10 Amending the US Constitution requires a two-thirds's vote of both the House (290) and the Senate (67), and a three-fourth's vote of the states (38) in favor. This last requirement is unreachable as regards 2A repeal, as just 13 states could block the amendment process.\n\nJasper, 10 What is the definition of \"a well-regulated militia\"? This part of the second amendment always seems to be ignored., 10 The state and federalpoliticians who block all effective gun control legislation are co-conspirators with the NRA in the serial mass murders we endure. Given a choice between the senseless death of innocents and the banning of  military grade semi-automatic assault weapons, they choose to sacrifice innocent children to the cruel god of limitless gun possession.. until the day when those who oppose the regulation of firearm possession are defeated for reelection, the carnage will continue.. , 10 The Second Amendment does not grant the right to bear arms. It protects that right from \u201cinfringement.\u201d The right, like, I believe, all rights mentioned in the Constitution, is supposed to be pre-existent: a natural right, a \u201chuman right,\u201d if you like, one men are endowed with by \u201ctheir Creator\u201d (a corollary, I would suppose, to the natural right of self defense).\nWhat needs to be removed is not the protection of this right, in the abstract, but the fuzzy interpretation of \u201cinfringed\u201d to mean almost any kind of limitation. All natural rights have their proper limitations (even the right to practice any religion doesn\u2019t extend to religions that involve human sacrifice).\nWhat is needed is stricter control of the right to bear arms, not repudiation of that right., 10 First. We need a Right to Life movement that advocates the right to live without the threat of being gunned down.\n\nSecond. We need to interpret the 2nd Amendment as honestly written, not as perverted by interpretation. Civilians can't buy grenade launchers. Why the right to an AR-15?, 10 Let's make sure we save all the posts and commentary and especially the thoughts and prayers for the next mass shooting so they can be re-used. It would save a lot of energy and angst and phony concern. , 10 Definitely, yes!  It\u2019s time to repeal the Secind Amendment.  There is no \u201cgodgiven\u201d right to gun ownership.  The Founders were Rationalists and would surely condemn what\u2019s going on as contrary to anything he ever hoped or dreamed.  It\u2019s proven, once again, the Law of Unintended Consequences.\n\nI think we\u2019re in the process of turning a corner on guns.  And I hope young people especially continue to speak out, to assemble in protest.  Many of them will be going off to college in the Fall.  And I hope when they get there, they will ignite a movement among even more young people.  They have the energy.  And they can paralyze schools and colleges, if necessary, in order to make clear their opposition to guns and their commitment to seeing change.\n\nNo more children should ever be sacrificed on the Altar of Gun Ownership.  It is a False God, a twisted religion, and has nothing to offer but carnage and human sacrifice, Child Sacrifice being the worst of the worst., 10 Anyone with a cache of assault weaponry has an addiction problem, not to mention some seriously evil psychopathology.\nWhy are citizens allowed to purchase more than a handgun and a hunting rifle?\nWhy are civilians given the right to purchase semiautomatic weaponry?\nWhy can I waltz into a gunsmith's or a gun show and become a proud, albeit deranged, owner of a gun intended to kill many/minute?\nThe 2nd Amendment kills children and innocent bystanders.\nThe 2nd Amendment is the great enabler of revenge tragedies and maniac shooting sprees., 10 Well, with a tip of the hat to Rodney King, perhaps liberals and conservatives CAN just get along.\n\nThe trouble is that all the \"common sense\" gun control proposals that could possibly survive the 2nd amendment trump card played by the gun lobby will have little to no effect. Universal background check?... Feel good \"at least we're doing something\" action. How do you set \"Minority Report\" conditions in a freedom loving, privacy hungry society (e.g. what mental health issues would restrict your rights? depression? anxiety? anger?....sorry women's rights marchers, no guns for you).\n\nThe kind of action that WOULD make a difference: banning private ownership of any semi-automatic firearm and tight regulation and registration of all allowable hand and long guns, along the lines of automobile ownership.\n\nSomeone needs to introduce an amendment to repeal the 2nd. Whatever its chances of success, it would at least spur a discussion of \"Why do we need it?\" The Constitution is not written in stone. African Americans are no longer legally 3/5ths of a person. Women can now vote. Why do we still need a Constitutional guarantee of the right to own a muzzle loading musket. Without a 2nd amendment, we can then have a conversation of what truly constitutes \"common sense\" gun control., 10 Actually, the case for owning a handgun for self-defense is false, as statistics show that they are more often turned against their owners than not. The tirelessly repeated bromide that it's people, not guns, is equally spurious. It's the people who handle the guns. And as has been pointed out in these pages before, let's stop assigning mental health problems when the shooter is white, but not when the shooter is black., 10 Let citizens make their representatives aware that they agree with the NY Times editors who make the case for repealing the second amendment by changing the constitutional right to bear arms to the privilege of carrying arms after proper licensing.\n\nI would go further than the editors in dealing with the contributions of the NRA to politicians. They not only should promise not to receive NRA funding, but also present a schedule of paying received NRA funds to a set of approved gun control organizations. Citizens can demand this as part of their precious vote. , 10 The second amendment was written into the constitution to protect people\u2019s right to a \u201cfree state\u201d and prevent tyranny (absolute power) \u2013 not personal protection. See David E.Vandercoy\u2019s The History of the Second Amendment.\n\nThe problem we have today is that the 2nd amendment has become moot for preserving a free state.  When it was written, a group of farmers, each with his own flintlock, had a fair fight against the King\u2019s army.  But today, a hypothetical band of 10,000 men with AR-15\u2019s and bump stocks (one man 10 shots per second) wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against the high tech U.S. military with tanks, mortars, rocket launchers, F-15\u2019s, and even (God forbid) nuclear bombs.  The Posse Comitatus Act is what stands between us and the U.S. military.\n\nIf you want to succeed, you need to start making the right argument for repealing the 2nd amendment.  It is moot, useless against tyranny and only serves to enable people to prepare to kill lots of people quickly.  Bret Stevens\u2019 argument and those of other columnists I\u2019ve read, miss the mark.  So if an NYT commentator can\u2019t get it right, how will it happen in my lifetime? , 10 Is it really necessary to repeal the Second Amendment, whatever it is stretched to mean? Constitutional rights must accommodate each other. Do Second Amendment rights outweigh America's children's rights to (just for example) life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Or must the former make room for the latter?, 10 I am 100% in agreement. Let's do it!\nAny ideas on how to start? I think that we need a separate group so this does not become a Republican vs Democrat issue. How about something called the Sandy Hook/Parkland Brigade, headed up by some American hero known as tough but fair who is admired by all? We would repeal the 2nd Amendment and put in place federal gun laws that allow limited armament for protection - one to a citizen, single shot pistol - and bolt action rifles for hunting. I'll join!, 10 You don't need to repeal the 2nd amendment. Just outlaw auto matic and semi-automatic weapons outside the military and law enforcement.  Outlaw open carry and concealment laws.  Allow gun owners to keep them in their homes for protection and allow hunters the right to enjoy their sport.  Every owner should be made to have a license and buy insurance for the protection of their fellow citizens., 10 Thank you, Mr. Stephens., 10 The 2nd Amendment worked just fine up until the NRA leadership was purged by a bunch of zealots in Cincinnati in 1977. Since then, uh, not so much. The difference? Forty years of propaganda and efforts to influence legal rulings in support of the canard that there's an individual right to bear arms for self defense. There isn't, and there never was. Blacks were unable to own firearms when the 2nd Amendment was ratified. It was written in response to the need for the militia that was hired to put down Shays' Rebellion in 1786-87. Post 1977, it was the successful selling of the the trifecta of guns fight crime, keep blacks in their place, and are an antidote to government overreach that led directly to today's pathetic state of affairs. Repeal of the 2nd Amendment is never going to happen, why don't we shoot for a sane realization of it?, 10 I doubt the Second Amendment can or ever will be repealed. What we need is a government and a judiciary that will actually enforce the amendment in its entirety. Anyone who owns a gun will automatically be required to become a member of a militia, regulated and commanded by an established authority i.e. - the state National Guard commander. Militia members will be required to account for the status of their guns, how many, where stored and provide for proper control of guns and ammunition. Just like any member of the military does with his or her weapon., 10 Second Amendment defenders believe that the right to bear arms is 'inalienable'. Period. That means the US cannot limit, question, keep track of, collect data on, or do very much about anything gun related - the Supreme Court has said so - yet the US does do that. There are laws about ownership, rules to be followed, PSAs about safe handling, licenses for buyer and for seller.  The fact that Americans can't yet own live grenades, tanks and shoulder mounted rocket launchers only means the NRA hasn't stepped up its game to create a market for weapons of war, beyond the assault rifle. Nothing will be done because Americans don't mind mass shootings, dead children, dead churchgoers, dead family members MORE than they mind having limitations on the 2nd Amendment. Only when the NRA finally finds all this carnage repugnant will Congresspeople find it repugnant, too., 10 Thank you, Mr. Stephens.  I agree that this second amendment has to go.  A musket that fires a ball that had to be front loaded was the technology that the framers knew; I cannot believe that unfettered access to weapons with high killing capacity would have been supported by people who saw participation in a militia to protect the community as the principal social justification of gun ownership.  There is so much to admire in the Constitution, but this vaguely worded amendment is not one., 10 Perhaps those opposed to gun control would agree to some restriction on the ownership of certain weapons it they were assured that their rights under the 2nd amendment were otherwise protected.  The amendment will never be repealed without a substitute that applies to all States and limits their ability to further restrict ownership. I do not see a comprise on this issue just as there will be none on abortion., 10 I'm for repealing (or at least revising) the Second Amendment to account for both contemporary weapons technology that our founders could not have foreseen, and the fact that the U.S. Armed Services constitute our well-regulated militia.  Despite objections from some corners that the Constitution is fixed, our nation does have a history of repealing and/or revising amendments (e.g. the 21st serving to repeal the 18th).\n\nBut a Constitutional repeal would be slow.  In parallel, we need to change our culture, as when we made other acceptable norms (racial segregation on buses, smoking, drunk driving) socially/legally unacceptable.  And we can use those successes as our models, acting both locally and nationally.\n\nBoycotts forced racial integration on public transit.  Complaints of hazardous working conditions led to the ban on smoking in businesses.  So why not a nationwide teachers walkout (with students joining in solidarity) to protest unsafe working conditions caused by the frequency of school shootings?  Yes, everyone boycott going to school!  That is not an unreasonable reaction from educators having to enforce lock-down protocols in addition to teaching their students.\n\nThe founders of MADD lobbied congress one by one to defy the alcohol industry and establish a uniform national drinking age.  Why not a push for  more restrictive, national standard for gun ownership?  We need persistent efforts like these while we attack the stickier issue of repeal., 10 A repeal would be wonderful for all.  Let's get guns and violence out of our psyche and culture.  If a repeal doesn't succeed, then let's rewrite the amendment to clearly state what it means and intends to mean.  That amendment is so vague but even with its vagaries, it still does not give gun owners the rights they claim.\n\nIf we are serious about guns, then we can control them by restricting manufacturers, what weapons they make and how they get distributed.  That would be an easy temporary fix within the powers of Congress as would heavy taxes on guns.\n\nThe NRA is no more than a mouthpiece for manufacturers.  It does not faithfully represent owners.  It's all about guns and profits., 10 Normally I'd be reluctant to repeal a Constitutional Amendment (well, except for the repeal of prohibition). But when the Supreme Court reinterpreted the Second Amendment with their Heller Decision, then it's time to act. \n\nIn Heller, the SCOTUS completely ignored the militia part of the Second Amendment, as if it were never written.\n\nThis judicial activism has to be corrected. One way would be to add five words, \"when serving in the militia,\" as suggested by former SCOTUS justice John Paul Stevens: \n\n\u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms when serving in the Militia shall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nThat would fix Heller. The only other sensible move would be repeal., 10 There is a solution short of repeal, and that is to overrule the case that found an individual right to bear arms. Only if we elect a progressive president and a progressive congress is there any hope of changing the makeup of the Supreme Court, and I admit that's a long shot. But so is repealing the second amendment. , 10 In 1982 Congress commissioned a study of the 2nd Amendment and report 'The Right to Keep and Bear Arms; Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate Ninety-Seventh Congress Second Edition'\n\nThis report explored the contemporary writings on the founding fathers which document that the 2nd Amendment is clearly focused on the right of the individual to own firearms.  In part this individual right was intended as a check to prevent a tyrannical government from oppressing the people of the U.S. just as King George had attempted.  Don't believe me - read the report.\n\nI personally have heard and read enough from the opponents of the 2nd Amendment and proponents of highly restrictive gun control to see that these groups sole and ultimate goal is the disarming of the American people.  For those who think this will eliminate firearm possession in the U.S. think back to Prohibition and how miserably that failed and to the current war on drugs.  Being illegal didn't and hasn't stopped the possession and trade in these prohibited goods. \n\nThink now how drunk driving has and is being addressed - we don't focus on the cars and alcohol as the causes of drunk driving, but on the individual who commits the crime.  Are the vehicle manufactures being sued because someone was killed by their car and the same for the maker of the alcohol? No, we focus the drunk driver. \n\nFocus on the killers, not the tools., 10 I'm a psychologist... and I don't know how many times I have to say this... saying that shooters are mentally ill and we need to treat them is a huge red herring. People who, at 19, are perfectly \"normal\" and thus can get a license and purchase guns, might encounter adverse life situations such as divorce, job loss, depression, etc., so that by 30 they're not stable. And if you identify and order a young man to go into therapy, what are the odds that he will cooperate and, even if he does, that it will forestall going off the deep end. And how much evidence does a parent need to turn in their child, that they love, and that heretofore has done some weird things but never hurt anyone. As a parent you may be afraid of your son or at least realize that if you \"turn him in\" you will lose the relationship forever. Net-net, the answer does not lie with mental health... it lies with limiting the possible lethality of a firearm., 10 If the basis of the second amendment is to insure the capacity to raise militias in local communities, then the existence of this amendment is not the problem. The problem is our inability to restrict consumerism related to firearms. Why not restrict ownership not eliminate ownership of weapons? Anyone with even minimal service in the military will tell you that rarely does a soldier, or potential combatant, possess multiple firearms. Those individuals usually are issued one, possibly have two, but never forty! , 10 Modern law is written with a definition section, to define key terms.  The constitution doesn't have one so we are left without a definition of \"arms,\" as in the \"right to bear arms.\"  The \"arms\" the constitution probably means were those arms commonly in use in 1787: muzzle loading guns that had a firing rate of no more than three shots per minute with someone very skilled doing it.  So, why not just define \"arms\" as something like that?  The \"arms\" that are used in our worst shootings are weapons that could scarcely have been imagined in 1787; they are weapons of mass murder, not arms as conceived at the time of the writing of the constitution.  It's hard for me to understand why anyone should be permitted to have a weapon like that.  But we do, don't we., 10 How? Repeal requires 2/3 of the House and Senate, then 3/4 of the states' legislators. That's not a bar we can reach. No, we have to pass gun control legislation within the barriers of the 2nd. I say we throw down as strict of rules as we can and let the courts sort it out.  There are limits to other Constitutional guarantees. The 2nd is no different. We just need law makers who have the guts to try., 10 I personally think the answer is somewhere between the repeal and what laws we have now. \n\nI personally think if you are going to own an Assault type gun. You do need to pass back ground checks and go through training. Obviously this is not going to eliminate problem.  \n\nThough I still believe an individual should have access to guns for hunting. Along with guns for self protection if you chose. , 10 The proposal that teachers should go on a nationwide strike on May 1 sounds like a good beginning to force Congress to adopt legislation.\n\nA good political start would be for voters to start notifying their Congressmen and Senators that they will no longer vote for them if they accept even $1  in financial contributions from the NRA. , 10 \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security if a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" \n\nMany commenters here read this, as I have, with state militias, which no longer exist in the 1791 form of a group of citizen farmers who may need to be called up to defend freedom, as the subject and being armed as the predicate but make no mistake- that is not how the ultra conservative right views the language. To those people the subject is \"the security of a free state\" and in their mind that subject is no less relevant today than it was when the amendment was adopted.  The questions then, if that is how it is interpreted are: what is a \"free state\" and who might threaten it?\n\nThe ultra right lives in a paracosm where the government of this country (a government under a Democratic administration of course) could be the agent of tyranny. It is their duty to be prepared to defend the \"free state\", which could be their \"state\" or their back yard or simply their state of being free from indigenous evil.\n\nThey will never give up this fantasy, it is central to their core sense of self. Any attempt to change or repeal the 2nd Amendment would be the wake of call that tyranny was indeed on their doorstep., 10 Actually, there is no good case to be made for owning a rifle for hunting, and only a flawed case to be made for owning one for self-defense.  The former promotes and sanctions needless killing under the pretense of \"sport.\"  Statistics abound with the ineffectiveness of the self-defense argument for the latter.  We need to stop injecting these caveats in every gun discussion. \"Responsible\" gun ownership is a cover for a gun-loving culture. We need to start loving our kids more than our guns., 10 IMO - When the second amendment was written, the guns owned by people were SINGLE shot that took 1 to 3 minutes to reload. In addition, the guns were expensive and only well to do people could afford them. If we followed the second amendment as originally written, we would not have ownership of AR15 rifles which by definition is an ASSAULT Rifle. This rifle is not used for hunting to feed the family. When is the last time that a herd of deer attacked an individual where she/he needed to defend her/himself. It\u2019s time to get real and look at the real life. If you want a gun, fine. Have a single shot gun and have multiple/rapid fire arms reserved for law enforcement ONLY. You still would have the right to keep and bear arms. Keeping to the letter of the amendment., 10 Automobiles in our state are registered and licensed.\nIf you want the privilege of driving, you must undergo extensive training.\nA driver's license indicates you have met some level of proficiency behind the wheel.\nLaws on the books for autos are designed for safety, for both the driver, passengers and others on the road.\nAll of this is required because in essence, an automobile is a machine that can kill you or someone else because of one small slip up.\nRepeal of second amendment?  I agree with that, but not sure it's gonna happen. We should treat gun ownership as we do cars, as a privilege, not a right.  They are killing machines.  , 10 Along with repealing the 2nd Amendment, how about repealing Citizen's United. As long as the NRA and GOA are \"people too\" and an poor unlimited dollars into campaigns, we will not see any changes to the deplorable gun violence in our country. The greatest hope I have for change are the courageous young people who protested in Florida. They can't vote yet, but they will vote one day. . . and they will be active, engaged voters. , 10 saw this online the other day ;\nWhy not just ban guns, and when people are upset about it - sent them 'thoughts and prayers'\nIf 'thoughts and prayers' are good enough for people who have lost a family member or friends then it's good enough for people who have lost their guns.\n\nIt worked in Britain and Australia - Americans can't be that much different from other humans?, 10 Sensible? Yes, but not realistic in a country where 20 dead 6-yr-olds didn't move the needle and dozens massacred in Las Vegas didn't justify a limitation on citizens' apparent right to purchase and use bump-stocks.\n\nLet's see if we can defeat the NRA on one little point and then try to mount some momentum off that.   Generational change will eventually solve this for us, but we can nudge the timeline with a couple of small victories in the next few years., 10 Ok, repeal it. I support that.\n\nAnd, before that is accomplished, let\u2019s interpret it in accord with our current reality of small weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAnd, if absolutely necessary in order to achieve that, we voters may have to start voting for capable representatives.\n\nUntil then, more unnecessary killings., 10 This is not as much a matter of the traditional \"gun culture\" in America (of which there certainly is one), as much as it is about good old American free market capitalism that dictates whatever increases sales and/or profit is inherently \"good\"! I was an NRA member many years ago, & I am a progressive, feminist, card carrying member of the ACLU (as well as a Vietnam Vet Against War). But so was Hubert Humphrey & many other \"liberals\". The problem is that the NRA abandoned it's traditional role in order to become the greatest marketing tool the firearm manufacturers could ever hope for. The industry needs to market \"new\" weaponry as guns last a long time, & interest in high capacity \"assault\" style weaponry promotes new purchases among \"already\" gun owners thus boosting new sales. The millions of dollars given to \"conservative\" politicians can't come from member dues alone (they're not that much). The NRA must be getting income from the manufacturers whose sales continue to skyrocket. Follow the money! Then convince the right wing to cease promoting nationalistic, pro war, military & police, & religious fanatical TV, movies & video games. Even cops have too much firepower thanks to gun marketing. The old revolver would not allow a cop to put 17 rounds into a fleeing unarmed Black male. \"The business of America is business\". Selling big guns is big business!, 10 Yes, repeal the Second Amendment.  And while we are at it, repeal the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to make prosecutions easier and convictions virtually assured regardless of guilt or innocence. \n\nEven if you were actually able to accomplish the impossible and confiscate all the guns in America, you would reduce gun deaths (by definition) but you would not stop mass murders.  Mass murders would continue using other weapons, most likely using homemade explosive devices like Tim McVeigh used in Oklahoma City to kill 168 people or the Boston Bomber did.  Mass murderers are a different sort than common gun deaths which usually occur either accidentally, or in the course of another crime, or during a personal dispute.  Mass murderers do extensive planning and preparation, are usually politically motivated or mentally deranged and have no personal animus toward most or all of their victims.  They will substitute other devices if guns were not available to them.\n\nMass killings repeatedly occur all over the world, both in nations with strict gun controls and in those without such controls.  The perpetrators are usually either politically motivated or mentally deranged.  \n\nThe arguments for gun controls have some validity regarding accidental deaths and personal disputes.  But gun controls would fail completely to address mass killings. , 10 Mr. Stephens is absolutely correct.  And once this spurious \u201cright\u201d is removed, require a license for every gun and liability insurance for every licensee., 10 I keep waiting for someone like Bret or anyone with influence to talk about ammo. Reducing and restricting ammo makes all of the guns that are out there that much more impotent. If that kid in Florida was faced with high prices and a very high bar to purchase ammunition, maybe at least one massacre is avoided. \n\nI\u2019ll keep waiting., 10 Those who believe that the 2nd Amendment grants unfettered rights to own guns would do well to actually read the Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, itself. In that decision, which first established the private right of gun ownership, Justice Scalia himself explicitly allowed for and even seemed to invite reasonable gun control, writing:\n\n\u201cWe also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller (an earlier case) said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \u201cin common use at the time\u201d. We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \u2018DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPONS.\u2019 \u201c (emphasis is mine)\n\nThe AR-15 and firearms with similar capabilities have now proven themselves to be \"dangerous and unusual\", thereby establishing the foundation for their prohibition or severe restriction. Lawmakers can and should take aim directly at private ownership of these weapons as a Constitutionally permitted major first step in stopping the assault rifle carnage.\n\n(See https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-ropeik/the-secret-weapon-gun-con_b_... for a more complete discussion and the article from which this comment is derived.), 10 The Supreme Court's Heller decision on the 2nd amendment protects the right to own a handgun to protect the home from invasion.  The decision expressly said the 2d Amendment does NOT prevent laws that prohibit the possession of automatic or even semi-automatic weapons, or large ammunition container called bumpstocks, because those weapons were dangerous or uncommon and not of the type that people would have brought from their homes in carrying out their militia responsibilities when the Bill of Rights was adopted around 1791.  \n\nSo stop catering to the nut job gun rights lobby.  Repealing the second amendment is as likely as Trump standing up tomorrow and confessing that he has been in bed with the Russians since his campaign because they have information about him that he does not want revealed.  , 10 Intellectual arguments about the empirical evidence against gun ownership are useless against the rabid paranoids who feel the 'need'  stockpile AR-15s to 'protect' themselves from the government.   I agree with Maggie125, vote Republicans out of office.  , 10 In the private sector, failure to act on a life threatening problem is grounds for immediate dismissal. After repealing the 2nd amendment, let's address the fact that our, ahem, civil servants are SELF serving bloviators riding the gravy train to retirement. , 10 The 2nd Amendment doesn't need to be repealed, it actually contains its own expiration clause: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, ... \u201d. In these days of atomic bombs, jet fighter bombers, and nuclear submarines, certainly a militia will not do the job; accordingly the 2nd Amendment has expired, and on any 2nd Amendment case before it, the Supreme Court should so rule. Secondly, the amendment (the only one that refers to things) allows \"arms\"; an arm being in those days a single-shot pistol or musket loading (mostly) rifle. It no more allows one to own a repeating rifle than it does to allow to own a fully-weaponized F-15.\nCould it be that what Mr. Stephens is really saying is that since the courts have become so politicized, the legislature must emasculate them ?, 10 Proposed amendment:\n1. The Second Amendment is hereby repealed.\n2. The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be prohibited but may be regulated consistent with public safety., 10 I wonder if the Russians infected the Internet on this issue as they did with the 2016 election, supporting gun rights and denouncing gun controls, as a means to support Trump and defeat Clinton. , 10  \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d But we are not really following this, just the part that says keep and bear arms.  Nothing is fully regulated. I doubt our forefathers, or even our own grandfathers, would approve of semi-automatic weapons for kids to kill kids. That is not protecting a free state. That is madness. \n\nSo what in the world are we doing?  America has made it next to impossible for many young people to seek any type of mental health care. Or anyone else for that matter. Insurance will not cover it. And who has 100$ an hour for months on end to spare for counseling? When they do get to a psychiatrist for out of control issues, there is no counseling. Just drugs. Drugs that can fuel aggression and suicidal thoughts. Parents are asking for help. There isn't any. And, if you are 18, you are protected by HIPAA laws. So you won't know anything even if you do get them in to see someone.\n\nPeople are always going to have guns. I think we need to re-think ammunition and start controlling that. If we regulated over the counter Sudafed purchases to decrease the Meth problem, don't you think regulating bullets could help? And as far as 18 yo with AR-15, look to your state legislature to control that. Hold them accountable. They are allowing it. I also hope all teens register to vote. \n\nVote out the bad guys. \n\nNot all bad guys carry guns. Some just have power. , 10 Correct. By their demonstrated inability to address the grievous actions of a few, the many have shown they cannot bear the responsibility of a right to bear arms. Repeal the second amendment.\n\nThe sky will not fall. We don't need, for instance, a constitutional guarantee of car ownership, yet automobiles somehow choke our roads. How about we repeal the right to own guns and replace it with a national system of firearm instruction and licensing, backed by a K-12 education initiative, federal research in gun safety, and state-financed infrastructure in firing ranges, gun clubs and so on, all built on the premise that gun ownership is a privilege and a responsibility like owning and operating a car?\n\nOwning a gun cannot any longer be a right of citizenship. A privilege, yes, and above all a responsibility of being a free member of our society., 10 Stephens is right. The core problem America has with guns is our belief that the right to keep and bear firearms is a fundamental human right. Only two other nations recognize a fundamental right to own guns in their constitutions\u2014Mexico and Guatemala\u2014and both constitutions limit that right. Switzerland in its gun laws acknowledges a right to own guns, but gun ownership isn't a constitutional right.\n\nAs Stephens notes, as long as the right to own guns is considered a fundamental right, regulating guns in any serious way will be difficult as our legal traditions require great restraint in limiting such rights. But the 2nd amendment presents other dangers.\n\nWhen Congress passed the 2nd, its primary concern was ensuring that military power rested with the people. Its intention wasn't to grant a right to rebel (as gun advocates often claim), but to ensure the people held the military power so that power couldn't be used against them. A citizens militia resists tyranny not by fighting against the king's soldiers but by being the king's soldiers. \n\nOver time, the 2nd has come to mean something far different from what the founders intended\u2014and far more dangerous. Now, we believe it recognizes an absolute right of individuals to use deadly force to defend their persons, property, and liberty. Most societies believe leaving the decision to use deadly force to individuals\u2014and allowing them the needed weapons\u2014is a recipe for chaos. Indeed, the 2nd as we now interpret it is exactly that., 10 Mr. Stephens, read the Second Amendment slowly and carefully and you will see why, in the many years preceding the 2008 Decision of the Scalia opinion in the Heller case, the opinions of our Courts and legal scholars was that the Second Amendment did NOT confer upon individuals, the rights of gun ownership, but only the rights of militias to keep arms. A reasonable reading of the amendment should confirm this interpretation. A re-interpretation by an enlightened Supreme Court might be an easier course to take than the repeal of the Second Amendment.\nDaniel Crupain, Attorney, 10 No thanks.  As a lifelong hunter with lifelong hunters in our family,  I cannot agree.   Our firearms are tools just like any other tools.  If you want universal background checks, fine.  If you want licenses for being a firearms owner, fine (it will go in my existing stack of federal and state licenses, most of which require much more extensive and rigorous background checks than the existing simple one for firearms).    Insurance?  Will my existing additional liability policies for my other occupations and hobbies be adequate? Mandatory safety training and mandatory requalification?  Fine.  We all have had hunter safety and firearms safety and teach others both hunter safety and firearm safety.  Registration of firearms?  How do you register firearms like some of my shotguns that are so old they don't have a serial number?  Both my insurance agent as well my local LEO's already have list of every firearm just because it makes sense for any stolen firearms and for my rifles, I keep a sample of a fired bullet from each of them.   Limits on numbers purchased?  We recently  bought 20 more weapons for our hunter safety program.  Overturn the second amendment?  Never.      , 10 Mr. Stephens\u2019 heart is in the right place, but merely repealing the Second Amendment won\u2019t do the trick.  You would still need national legislators and a president willing to pass restrictive gun laws (as they can already do under the Heller decision).  What we need is the political will, and that is apparently in shorter supply in this country than common sense., 10 Since even the hardest core 2nd Amendment fundamentalists concede that some arms are too deadly to be legal outside the military (e.g., a bazooka), let's focus the debate on the definition of \"too deadly.\"\nTo inform that debate, it's worth look at automobile, whose efficiency is measured as MPG. In analogy, let's rate arms by their maximum capacity to kill. say maximum KPM (Kills Per Minute). A knife, for example,is a 5 KPM device. While the atomic bomb that destroyed Nagasaki was about 400,000 KPM. \n\nMr Congressman, what KPM is too high for you? The AK-15's 120 KPM ok with you?  I can't hear you, sir.  , 10 Taking guns away from the populace is one of the first steps to dictatorship. Slippery Slope my friend ..., 10 How about REPLACE with \"The right to bear arms necessary for self defense shall not be infringed\"?, 10 Why do you say he is \u201ca killer without a cause\u201d? He is a member of the hard right, which trained him with guns and hate. That is his cause., 10 Using logic to convince the John and Jane Waynes of America they need to give up their guns is not going to work. After all, any citizen who took high school civics class knows the second amendment clearly states, \u201cfor the maintenance of an orderly militia, and for the protection of each home, and amusement of bored and frustrated citizenry; muskets, rifles, pistols, bump-stocks et al shall not be regulated or denied to any American.  The British are coming!!!\u201d.  Guns are part of our mythology like Vikings horns are to the Norse (they aren\u2019t -only Minnesota Vikings).  Take away our guns and Americans lose their identity of a lawless, semi-civilized nation in need of a sheriff to set us straight., 10 Folks who offer thoughts and prayers might want to consider this - think about voting for pro-gun control representatives and pray they get elected. Perhaps then we could some sanity brought back to America. The NRA and its Congressional minions must be told \u201cno more\u201d. , 10 this column might make more sense if more americans were somewhat rational about guns....., 10 \"...but since Americans aren\u2019t dramatically crazier than other nationalities...\"\n\nEnough Americans voted to elect an incredibly unfit individual as president.  I think that undercuts your above statement., 10 Honor the 2nd Amendment! Defend it against the rising tide of leftist radicals and all the touchy-feely, goody-goodies attached to their coat-tails. Bearing open arms by citizens of good will and sound mind is the best deterrent against the antisocial elements.\nPromote the passage of the yet to come 34th Amendment, with the three critical words, ignored or overlooked by the Founding Fathers, inserted in the text:\n\"... the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS, shall not be infringed\"., 10 Every gun must have a registration. No amo without a registated gun. Limits on amo, and elimination of high caliber amo. Gun buybacks for the guns whose amo is illegal. , 10 Let's just replace the \"flashy thing\" comma Scalia discerned after the word \"State\" with a regular command - and give both halves equal meaning. , 10 Western Iraq, Yemen, Indian State of Bihar etc. have huge number of illegal guns. Out there political assassinations, sectarian warfare is the norm. They covet for the gold medal in homicide rates.\n\n... but yet, I have not heard cases of a madman going into a school and shooting innocents in any of these places.\n\nFood for thought., 10 I disagree with the author because the second amendment was intended to allow Americans to band together and take up arms against tyranny.  The current feckless state of our government and the tendencies of our \u201cleaders\u201d toward authoritarian rule does not foreclose (in my mind) the possibility that remedies enshrined in our constitution may need to be considered at some point in the future by a truly patriotic citizenry., 10 I am retired law enforcement and totally agree. At least amend the Second Amendment so it conforms to the realities of the 21st century., 10 I feel afraid. I feel threatened. Statistically, it is not safe here in America, due to the immense availability of guns and ammunition. Statistically I have a better chance of being killed by a gun than being hit by a car or poisoned by bad city water or ingesting salmonella. We have well regulated traffic laws, (mostly) great water management systems, and appropriately rabid monitors of our food supplies. Statistically my life has more risk if I am a teacher -- will my insurance company  raise my rates? Can I file a negligence claim against my country for its failure to protect me from the clear and present danger of death by semi-automatic weapons?    , 10 If we repeal the 2nd Amendment will we have to move all the numbers or can we stick in a new sanity clause to confuse the deluded gun owners. No jokes on \"sanity clause\" please., 10 Please, there's already 4 million trillion (you get the idea) guns in US households today.  The whole idea of \"gun control\" is ludicrous; that horse left the barn decades ago.  Why, instead, aren't we talking seriously about the one solution that CAN be made to work: regulating ammunition?  Bullets, magazines, etc. as a controlled substance.  It's easier to buy bullets in this country than it is to buy antihistamines.  Good grief., 10 With his first two paragraphs, Stephens is correct. And American society would be just as correct to reject those demands. Reacting in the heat of the moment nearly-always leads to bad policy decisions and law; e.g., the PATRIOT Act and the many abuses that followed.\n\nThe problem is not guns; the problem is the people who trigger them.\n\nWith the possible exception of the Las Vegas Shooter, nearly every mass shooting in recent memory was preceded by warnings and signs weeks and months prior. The agencies empowered to respond to such warnings and signs failed to respond when alerted about them (The \u201c9/11 Problem\u201d). If the systems we have in place to protect society are not going to pay attention to alert signals, then we might as well settle in for a long slog \u2014 because if not guns, other weapons are readily available and the problem still exists., 10 The current SCOTUS has misinterpreted the 2nd amendment.  The same right wing justices that insist on literal interpretation of the constitution do the opposite on the second.  Clearly they were protecting the tie between the Republican party and the NRA.  The illegal and immoral blocking of President Obama's appointment kept the misinterpretation in tact with Gorsuch's appointment.\nThe Amendment  says \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and to bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\na well regulated militia means just that.  It must be regulated by sensible  rules./, 10 Thank you, Mr. Stephens, for this epitome of common sense.  It should be required reading very widely, especially by Republican politicians.  Please keep up the good work!, 10 Why not repeal and replace? Why not remove vague, outdated language? Why not add a clear distinction between firearms that are legally available to the public and those that are not, and guarantee the right to possess the former?, 10 Thank you for revisiting this Mr. Stephens, especially in the face of conservative media and politicians who, by their writing and speech evidently value their conservative credentials more than facts and reason, the social fabric and safety of the country, or even the lives of children., 10 Absolutely right. Since \"a well-regulated militia\" is no longer part of our landscape, why should the absolute right to bear and keep arms still be? Let's regulate guns the way we do, say, cars, with licensing, registration, mandatory safety features, and mandatory instruction. , 10 Of course the problem is the Second Amendment. \n\nThe collectivist legal interpretations of the Amendment date from the National Firearms Act of 1934. Before that the only Federal Gun Law was the Second Amendment, and every State Constitution recognized it, back then just about anyone could legally own just about any kind of firearm. See also, Machine Gun Kelley, among many others. Heller and McDonald merely re-affirmed parts of what had been the generally understood law of the land prior to the Gangster era.\n\nLook at it this way. Change just a few of the words in the Second Amendment and one may see the original intent of the Founding Fathers: \n\nA well regulated state militia, being necessary to the security of any state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall always be infringed if they're not part of the state militia.\n\nIn the light of that basic illustration, any conservative majority Supreme Court is likely to always see the phrase, \"the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\" as the preeminent legal declaration of the Amendment.\n\nYou can't eliminate a Constitutional Right more than temporarily, and the wind blows every which way, without legally repealing that Constitutional Right., 10 How about just trying this? Other countries, as you point out, have had the courage to do so. After all, if in a few years it doesn\u2019t seem to be working (although this is highly unlikely, compared with the current situation), other measures could be tried. It is the status quo that is a disaster. , 10 I would be satisfied if the country went back to our understanding of the Second Amendment that existed before the disastrous Heller decision by the Supreme Court, which detached the practice of private gun ownership from membership in a state militia, and made it much easier for people to walk around with loaded weapons. \n\nIn addition, any incremental reforms we could make, like universal background checks or licensing requirements, might begin to change the perception among so many in this country that guns are an essential component of liberty. \n\nPeople used to think driving drunk was ok, even funny. People used to think smoking was cool. These are long term projects to change public perception. It can be done with guns as well, although it could take decades to accomplish. At least my grandchildren would be safe., 10 310 million guns.  42% of households have guns.  Hmm.  Not sure the solution here is constitutional reform.  , 10 If the Second Amendment lovers want to shoulder their muskets and march around in formation on the village green on Saturday mornings as part of their training for our \"well-regulated militia\" as the founding fathers intended, then I have no problem with that. They can lock their single-shot muskets back up in the community armory when they're done and check them out again next Saturday. \n\nOh, wait. That's not how the modern interpretation of the Second Amendment goes, is it? See Paddock, Cruz, Lanza, Kelley, etc., etc., etc.\n\nThe idea that the Second Amendment cannot be repealed or modified is ludicrous. The founding fathers never envisioned AR-15s and semi-automatic handguns in the hands of every citizen, crazy or not. , 10 how about, instead of repeal of the 2d, we observe it, all of it?\n\nwe're in this mess because we (as is our habit) opted for the \"rights\" clause (\"to keep and bear arms\") and disdained the \"obligations\" clause (\"a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state...\"\n\nthe amendment, a distillation of earlier requirements that each of the able-bodied maintain a firearm, just in case, confirms the need for readiness, rather a civic duty than a personal privilege. \n\nfat chance of getting that spirit back, so...while the argument rages on as it will, let's at least do something do-able, harden the entrances to our schools, and keep close, armed, watch over them....no new laws needed to get this done and, so, to keep the shooters, however they get their guns, away from our kids., 10 Mass shooting sequence --\n1. Thoughts and prayers\n2. Calls for gun safety/gun control legislation\n3. Calls for more good people with guns vs. bad people with guns\n4. Calls to treat mental illness more aggressively or curb violent video games\n5. Mourn the dead and support the injured\n6. Resolute Congressional inaction\n7. NRA contributions to Congress\n8. Continued gun sales to more fearful Americans\n9. Rising anger in disaffected and marginalized (usually white) men who assemble an arsenal...\n\nWash, rinse and repeat.\n\nPoliticians, columnists, newspapers and broadcasters can just recycle the same old, same old without having to think or work much at all.  These repetitions only serve to INCREASE the risk of contagion and add only heat and no light to the issue.  How about a seven day moratorium instead?  Turn down the volume.  There is value in silent contemplation., 10 A principled conservative!  A rare bird indeed, Mr. Stephens.  I congratulate you.  Now you need to take the next step:  Form an organization.   You could call it \"Conservatives for the repeal of the 2nd amendment.\"  I'm not a conservative, but I would contribute to your organization., 10 It's not necessary to repeal the Second Amendment. We simply must insure that every person who has more than a small sporting firearm be registered and prepared properly to participate in a well regulated militia. , 10 Legal scholars have proven repeatedly that the Second Amendment, as written, is inapplicable and obsolete.  Unfortunately a reactionary Supreme Court embraced the specious reasoning of Justice Scalia and found some individual right to bear ....military weapons?  Based on what?  Original intent!  A completely false and fabricated theory. The Founding Fathers didn't buy that nonsense and neither should we.  The Amendment reads that a \"well-regulated militia\" is its \"paramount\" purpose.  Naturally.  The US did not have a standing army in 1782: we relied on civilian militias to protect us from foreign enemies like the British.   We now have a professional standing army.  And a heavily armed, NON-regulated military arms buying public.  Either way, there really is no constitutional right to buy weapons when those weapons are a clear and present danger to the health, safety and welfare of the nation.  There is a clear constitutional DUTY for government to protect us from that.\n But the Reactionary Five deliberately overlook that principle.  Scalia's propaganda lives on in the Federalist Society, co-founded by him.  This national organization exists to harass law school administrations.  It seeks  to coerce them from unbiased teaching of legal principles, to attack minority student programs, to silence professors whose opinions support the rule of law and to identify GOP loyalists who are willing to substitute party loyalty for democratic principles., 10 Anyone who thinks that firearms will protect them from the federal government is mentally ill. Anyone who thinks that ubiquitous guns make the American citizenry safer is mentally ill. Anyone who takes money from the NRA, which foments terrorism within the United States, is a moral reprobate who better hope that there is no Dante's Inferno.\n\nIt's like we're debating whether punching someone in the face should be protected by an Amendment to the Constitution. Yes, you are free to throw a punch, and if you're alone in a hotel room, no harm no foul. However, if that punch connects, you will pay a price. However, the potential for mayhem if you throw a punch is limited. The potential if you fire a gun can seem unlimited.\n\nWhen Charles Whitman climbed the water tower and gunned down students in Texas many years ago, it was evident that the American fetish for guns would produce tragedy with predictable frequency. When we rue the Postmodern \"whatever I believe is true\" mindset of our right-wing brethren, we can trace its roots not only to the Domino Theory but also to the insane notion that an armed populace is a safe populace.\n\nWelcome to Have-gun-i-stan., 10 Where is that 'well regulated Militia'?  The Second Amendment is outdated and serves no purpose other than to sustain a well-funded gun manufacturers lobby.  , 10 We do not need guns to defend ourselves against tyranny.  Assad was on the way out until the opposition started shooting.  When social protest turns violent it looses.  Even 33 guns will not provide much defense at the Concord Bridge against \"black helicopters\".  The NRA demonstrates this every day:  their political power emanates, not from the barrel of a gun, but from their mailing lists and their connectedness.  All this is obvious.\n\nHow have we come to imagine otherwise?  Locke did not maintain that guns are the foundation of civil liberties.  The political power of our founding framers did not come from their flintlocks but from their pledge to stand together.  Guns exacerbate social divisions and escalate conflicts.  That is why the Russians loved the AK-47: not as a basis upon which to establish their own liberties but as a device to destabilize and corrode the liberties of others.  The only thing that comes out of the barrel of a gun is social chaos.  , 10 Maybe this is misplaced hope, but I really think that the next generation will indeed get rid of the second amendment.  They will also be astonished at the supine politicians who keep mouthing the same old platitudes and offering thoughts and prayers instead of useful action.\n\nI really believe that the NRA and GOA are living on borrowed time., 10 \u201cWe need to repeal the Second Amendment because most gun-control legislation is ineffective when most Americans have a guaranteed constitutional right to purchase deadly weaponry in nearly unlimited quantities.\u201d\n\nThis is incorrect. You can have both the Second Amendment, AND national gun legislation to curb the type and quantity of  weaponry and ammunition. It has been done before, and with leadership, can be done again. It\u2019s not the NRA, its simply politics. , 10 The 2nd Amendment allows for a well regulated militia to be armed. And the framers intended for those arms to be muskets.\nSince we have no militia, there's no reason for people to be armed., 10 How sensible.  Let's agree the Constitution and its amendments is not a social suicide pact.  It is to set up to \"form a more perfect union\".  In my book slaughter of children is not part of a perfect union!  This amendment is no longer serving its intended purpose - supporting militias., 10 It is not just the mass killings that cause tragedies, it is the misuse of the instruments.  The most recent fire known as the Detwiler Fire in California was caused by a single gunman shooting a gun in a prohibited area.  The result? 83 thousand acres burned, 68 homes destroyed, an entire town evacuated for four days.  The disruption was massive.\nAnd nobody knows who did it.  , 10 I think it is time for us to give up.  The NRA has won and that is that.  To ease the transition to a NRA dominated society, we will hand every person who is certified as insane a free gun and 500 rounds of ammo.  If the insane person is also considered to be a danger to himself or others, he will be given a military type weapon and 1000 additional rounds of ammo.  I mean why bother with gun shows and things like that when we can hand them their weapons directly?, 10 The GOP has been playing the populism card for many years, appealing to our lesser virtues of fear, resentment, and selfishness.  Coupled with an increasingly uneducated populace this is a dangerous path, one that is decidedly not bending toward justice.  \n\nGOP support for the NRA and gun rights is a political ploy just as their positions vis a vis immigration, right to life, integration, and same sex marriage are.  In the 60-70's the GOP were supportive of strict gun control and segregation as they feared minority rights and blacks getting guns, and then cynically they realized that they could use gun control and integration as a \"wedge issues\", as they then did with abortion rights.  More recently same sex marriage and immigration have been used to divide the nation for purely political reasons and with disastrous consequences - all to maintain power in the face of a changing demographic.  , 10 The Heller decision was one of the worst and most dangerous ruling the Supreme Court has made in recent times. That said; nothing in Heller suggests we cannot limit the number and/or types of guns Americans can purchase. The NRA has purposefully set out a line of propaganda which ignores that simple fact. They pay their political mouthpieces to extend that propaganda in Congress. \n\nIt is now time to elect politicians who will limit who has access to guns and the types of guns allowed. We can rid ourselves of most every type of gun manufactured, except for a select few to satisfy the Second Amendment. We need to find the politicians with the courage and patriotism to do so, 10 I don't see this ever happening as long as people can remember the gruesome 20th Century legacy with its 100,000,000+ violent civilian deaths at the hands of governments., 10 There's no need to repeal the Second Amendment. We just need the NRA and conservatives to start reading it in a rational manner. \n\nI'm as much a libertarian as anyone, but even I recognized that NONE of our Constitutional rights are absolute. Even the 1st Amendment is subject to limitations such as those for child pornography, libel/slander, incitement to riot, reasonable restrictions on time and place, etc.\n\nThis is not a liberal or a conservative position nor is it controversial- it is well accepted jurisprudence. Scalia himself said that the court's conclusion in Heller  didn't preclude all gun regulations.\n\nDoes the right to bear arms include the right to own surface to air missile launchers? To build nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons in your basement? Only a crazy person reading the 2nd Amendment in an absolutist fashion could make that argument. \n\nOnce you've accepted that access to such weapons can be limited you've accepted that there are reasonable limitations on the 2nd Amendment. From there we're just arguing about where those boundaries are., 10 In the military, you go through a good deal of screening and training before you get to handle an M-16.\n\nIn civilian life, almost anyone can buy a similar semi-automatic rifle at any time, without any screening or training., 10 Repeal is a common sense idea and imo a good one. We all know though that it is not going to happen. At least not in most of our lifetimes. \n\nThe issue is not complicated at all unless of course one wishes to follow along gun lobby lines. Each passing event brings a new range of intentional complications. They tend to rely on obvious stretches of fact and reality. Meaning they are based largely on opinion. \n\nThe most simple fact of the matter is that the gun lobby owns the voice of congress and our current president. The NRA and money carry more weight in congress than the lives of innocents. Money prevails while our children die. \n\nThe only people afforded the means to change the culture are scared to death of challenging it. Deflect, skew, obfuscate, twist, lie, stall, stretch. Whatever it takes to keep the money flowing. It is particularly revealing that in a country as rich and supposedly culturally advanced as ours that we have to first weigh the advantages when considering the lives of our children and loved ones against the right to own weapons of mass death., 10 Will America repeal the second amendment in wake of mass shootings?\n\nAmerica seems to gradually be experiencing the WW2 aftermath the Axis powers experienced at the time: Prior to, and leading up to WW2, the Axis powers were well armed and powerfully flourishing states, with highly developed artistic and scientific life. In fact the Allied powers were in the same situation. For all differences in politics between major actors of WW2, there was a high degree of liberty, belief in the individual citizen within various states. But WW1, and then of course WW2 changed that.\n\nAfter WW2 the Axis powers were essentially stripped of arms. And their cultures declined in favor of tame democracy and controlled economies of production. France and Britain gradually followed suit. Still, of course, the latter retain more liberty. But the Allied powers, including Russia, see the writing on the wall. All of the advanced world sees its fate in tame democracy, decline of art, loss of arms, loss of free speech, citizens organized in official economies of production. In America of course, this process has been going on since Vietnam, the military increasingly suspect, ruthlessly criticized, and now with mass shootings citizens with arms scolded. A gradual defanging of the nation.\n\nProbably both right wing authoritarianism and left wing political correctness, globalization and multipolarity are forces of slow war driving advanced societies into democratic tameness at price of all humans suspect. , 10 For me, of course, it was Newtown. Newtown is too close to here, the children were too young, the teachers too defenseless. Then, there was the death of a young basketball player in nearby Poughkeepsie, collateral damage in a shooting aimed at someone else. He died the day he made all county MVP and was with his friends, his future never more bright and open.\n\nThat was when I realized that those children, that young man don't matter. Because Congress did nothing to make their deaths count, to erase the senseless waste. \n\nThey could have put limits on ammo, made weapons designed for war illegal. They could have demanded registration, even on private sales.  Maybe the next group of babies and the next bright star would have a chance. Maybe it would be harder for a brute in a small city in a state with gun control to get hold of a gun shipped in illegally from a state with lax rules. \n\nBut they died brutally and in vain. And that is when I just gave up on us. \n\nI don't think the second amendment needs to be repealed, and I don't think it possible. And I don't think pushing for it will find a compromise middle ground that will save lives. \n\nWe need a collective conscience in this country that we sorely lack. So if you make any of the following arguments when faced with gun control - we don't ban cars; the second amendment guarantees it; it is a mental health problem; most gun deaths are self-inflicted; - then you are culpable. Own it., 10 The thing is decades out of date. Like most of the Constitute, it needs a radical re-write--now. , 10 While the 2nd Amendment is in the Bill of Rights, it impedes on the Natural Rights so dear to our founding as a Country  ... \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\" (Declaration of Independence). So, why is someone\u2019s gun ownership unconstrained to the detriment of my, your, our children\u2019s lives?, 10 The \"great\" thing about calling for a focus on mental health, in response to gun deaths and gun massacres, is that you don't have to actually do anything concrete as a follow up. Indeed, except for this one aspect of mental health, Republicans have done all they can to undo mental health support of all kinds., 10 Since there is no way the required super majorities needed - two-thirds of each House, followed by three-quarters of the States - will ever be mustered, the discussion is moot.  But for argument's sake, why not repeal the first amendment?  Words have killed many more people than American versions of the Kalashnikov., 10 The Second Amendment should have been repealed a long time ago.  The true meaning of the amendment is ambiguous and only enables the gun obsessed members of our society to arm themselves to the teeth., 10 For centuries the courts said the 2nd Amendment did NOT mean that individuals were guaranteed the right to a gun. This notion is lobbyist/propaganda driven and extremely modern. In fact the case that decided it isn't even 10 years old.\n\nAnd like Bush v Gore, SCOTUS had to ignore all precedent - along party lines - to give gun manufacturers this huge victory.\n\nThe 2nd Amendment - if you know any history at all - was about one thing: preventing a standing army, which the Founders thought posed a grave risk to democracy. \n\nIt wasn't about guns for hunting or protection, because those rights were state based. As Bernie has said, a farmer in VT probably needs different gun laws than a teenager in NYC. \n\nThe bigger problem though is that Americans are clueless about the underlying issues re: Gun Violence, and are being lead around by a dishonest media and disastrous politicians. \n\nA quick example: How much money would the NRA have to give you to go shoot up a local school? \n\nA million? 10? A billion?\n\nMost people wouldn't do it for any amount of money. And that's because only corrupt people can be bribed. So the NRA is offering bribes, but similar groups do this worldwide... and it only works in the US. So the NRA is a SYMPTOM of the corruption in the US, not the cause. Remove them and another group will take their place. And always will, unless the underlying problem is addressed., 10 The US has a fetish about guns.\n\nIf the second amendment guaranteed unlimited access to - say - Brussels Sprouts, no one would care because no one actually likes Brussels Sprouts.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many people are killed. Too many Americans are addicted to their guns, and no matter how much harm it causes, they just can't seem to cut down.\n\nI would also love to see a less fundamentalist attitude towards the Constitution in general. Something written two Centuries ago by a group of white, male, slave-owning politicians is not necessarily the best model for modern society. But loosening up about the Constitution (which is never going to happen anyway) won't solve the gun problem, or the killing. If no one actually wanted guns, the Second Amendment would be just another archaic, irrelevant clause gathering dust - like the Third Amendment (remember that one?).\n\nSo get used to it. The guns aren't going anywhere and the killing is going to continue. We can either stop making a fuss about it, or we can move somewhere better., 10 No need to repeal anything -- the Second Amendment does NOT prevent strict gun control measures!\n\nThe right to keep and bear arms is not an individual one - it is a collective one, the right of the \"people\" in a well-regulated militia (now the national guard). The Constitution itself makes the president the commander-in-chief of the militia.\n\nThe Second Amendment was intended in part to ensure that the militia could put down domestic insurrections (e.g. National Guard troops sent to Little Rock).  A private right to keep and bear arms was never even discussed when the Second Amendment was being drafted. It certainly was never intended to give individuals the right to rebel against their government.The Federalist as well as Madison's journal of the proceedings of the constitutional convention, and the history of militias at the time make all of this crystal clear.\n\nThe NRA itself had no problem with this correct interpretation of the Second Amendment, and was in favor of gun control, for more than a century until it got taken over by the gun manufacturers and started spewing pro-gun, fake-history propaganda.\n\nOh, and regarding that 10 U.S.C. 246 nonsense. Another NRA red herring. The so-called \"unorganized militia\" is not a well-regulated militia.\n\nPrivate gun ownership should be subject to licensing, registration, insurance, taking a gun safety course, and a background check., 10 When The Last President was in Office, he was to address Our Nation directly on the peril we are facing with this relaxed outlook of the Right for Americans to bear Arms.  'He wants to take our weapons away' from a hard-working construction worker now retired.\n\nFrom Florida an exchange takes place, where a teacher laments her husband's depression and drinking, ending with 'at least he no longer keeps a gun in the house'.  Silence.\n\n'There's a good case to be made for owning a handgun for self-defense', writes Mr. Stephens, reminding this American of an American tragedy, before this columnist was born.  He will find it in the 'Two Mrs. Grenvilles' by the late author Gregory Dunne, where a socialite guns down her husband because she thought he was an intruder.  It held the Public's attention for weeks, and my parent was to say 'He used to tease her'.\n\nA woman shops at the Convenience store holding her two-year old toddler, who reaches into her bag. and triggers her handgun.  One reads of these tragedies every day now in the newspaper.\n\n'I might like to learn how to shoot again' from Austria.  'What!' from this commentator, whatever for?  Are you planning to bake rabbit pie?'  It just goes to show that the best of friends remain mysterious.  In times of War, a Vice-President shoots an acquaintance on a hunting spree?  To the victims and their families who are grieving, Your Tragedy is becoming 'Ours'.\n\nIt is not right, Mr. Stephens, and empty words with no action ring hallow. , 10 The framers of our laws did not know about bump stocks, silencers and semi-automatic weapons. Where are all those right of center who adhere to the originalist doctrine?, 10 We can\u2019t do that, it makes too much sense., 10 Of course. Unfortunately, amendments & repeals are an almost impossible hurdle. If my kids were still school-age, I'd be looking to emigrate my family from the U.S. to a civilized country. For the sake of my grandchild I hope my son's family emigrates. Also, every politician who has taken money from the NRA is as guilty of mass murder as the gunmen who actually pull the trigger. And every dues-paying member equally so., 10 All arms should be rated by it maximum capability to kill in KPM (Kills Per Minute) and maim in MPM (Maims Per Minute) for easy comparisons.\n2nd Amendment enthusiasts could then be asked to state for the record their limits for domestic ownership., 10 Our government was formed to protect \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" The Constitution is a living document, designed to enable these protections, forming a system of government best able to deliver them. Right now, with more people dying on our streets from gun violence than in all our wars, this system is failing to deliver those protections. That is certainly powerful reason to edit the Constitution, and the Second Amendment is the focal point here. While there is hardly political consensus to get there now, this is logically the correct approach - though logic, reason, and science are fading in this time as a basis of policy.  But perhaps finding some way to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill can be a start. If we can achieve even some measurable progress, it could start a (for once) positive feedback loop, that could make people think: \"OK, what else can be do to reduce firearms fatalities?\", 10 The Second Amendment is not the problem. The problem is the United States Supreme Court's decisions in Heller and McDonald holding that the Amendment bestows a personal right to firearm ownership. The Second Amendment reads, \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Heller and McDonald ignore the Amendment's clear meaning that the federal government cannot interfere with the States' rights to regulate their Militias, and thus their citizens' rights to possess firearms. A proper interpretation of the Amendment would provide states with broad discretion to regulate firearms. Since Heller and McDonald, Illinois has been forced to allow credentialed individuals to carry concealed handguns in public. The Second Amendment ought to permit Illinois (and other states if they so choose) to ban this practice. I am heartened that New York and Connecticut's assault weapon bans have thus far survived court scrutiny, but I fear we are one zany Supreme Court justice short of a holding that the Second Amendment provides all citizens with the right to possess the mass shooter's firearm of choice.  , 10 Agree. If anyone can read, they will realize first that the Second Amendment does not apply today and second that it has nothing to do with self-protection. \n\nI think the solution applies more at the state level than the federal level. States like Missouri, Florida, Texas, Nevada need to reverse their loose gun laws. An attempt was made in Maine to expand background checks which failed. Only when states realize that their loose gun laws are a problem will results happen. Voters in those states need to replace their state legislature representatives who oppose strict gun laws.\n\nOnce changes are made at the state level, they are more likely to be reflected at the federal level.,, 10 What is so sacrosanct about this Second Amendment I cannot understand. The Second Amendment was written more than 200 years ago under different circumstances when we did not have AR 15 and other powerful weapons.The Second Amendment did not come from the bible. Without repealing the Second Amendment or replacing it with some meaningful gun ownership laws we are not doing justice to so many people who lost their lives due to gun violence., 10 If you are concerned about gun violence but haven't joined a gun control organization and/or donated to one, you are part of the problem, not part of the solution. Your comments here are meaningless, as are those posted on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and wherever else online. \n\nFixing this problem, even if that means repealing the 2nd amendment, requires shoe leather and hard work, and the blunt truth is that most voting age Americans do not (yet) care enough to do that. We all want to hide at home. So the killings will continue. , 10 If insurance is required before driving a car, why is insurance not required before owning a gun?, 10 The Second Amendment is not necessarily a barrier to gun legislation, as shown by the history of the National Firearms Act of 1934, which effectively banned machine guns.\nI'm not convinced that \"Americans aren\u2019t dramatically crazier than other nationalities.\" Consider that some European countries have a rate of gun ownership a third of the U.S. rate, but homicide rates a tenth or less of ours. Evidently Americans have a greater propensity to shoot each other.\nOr consider that school shootings and other mass shootings have significantly increased in recent years. while the availability of guns (measured in the percentage of households with guns) has remained constant or even declined. , 10 I understand your frustration but your proposal is a none starter. I'm not against it but the idea is a waste of time. Best to focus your attention on politically viable solutions, not futile ones., 10 For a long time I kidded myself that we couldn't take away 1 of the ten rights in the bill of rights. The mass shootings of the past few years has convinced me different. The Second Amendment has got to go.\nThe stuff about taking guns away from the \"mentally ill\" is just scapegoating. Some have argued for giving up the names of those disabled for \"mental illness\" on social security. These people are no more dangerous than anyone else. Let's not pick on them.\nAnd yes, these shooters DO have a cause. It is to express tremendous anger, kill people and get attention.\nYes, I want to come for your guns. There is no legitimate use for them-- not self defense, not hunting. , 10 I've come up with a new idea that is worth considering.\n\nThe courts have recognized that \"the right to bear arms\" is not unlimited. We know further from studies in criminology that most people, most men, \"age out\" of crime by around 30 years old. Okay: no one can own a gun, especially a handgun, under the age of 28 without having undergone special training by a police force or similar organization, like the military. Ex-military men under that age would have to undergo training about the proper use and handling of firearms in the civil world.\n\nThis would put anyone, like the killer in Florida who evidently developed a love of weapons, next to a police officer who could evaluate his fitness and mental state. Sure, a lot of people might be able to pass themselves off as sane, but many also wouldn't. Each time a potential mass killer is stopped would be victory. Such a program would also help reduce individual acts of violence.\n\nWe can't go on this way. High school and college kids across the country now rightly fear for their lives in a place that is supposed to be safe and protected, a place of calm learning and fond experiences.\n\nMass killings are a contagion, a fad for sick minds to follow. By reducing the number of mass murders, others will not have the encouragement that these events bring to sick minds. There is no one magic cure, but we must take this on step by step and defeat it. , 10 \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThe Second Amendment was written when the country as a whole, and the individual states, were still a very fragile construct. There was no standing defense force, so every able-bodied man had to be armed in order to join a \"well regulated militia.\"\n\nRegardless, the Framers didn't write the Amendment as: \"The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"  \n\nYet as far as the Roberts Court goes, they might as well have, given the 2008 5:4 decision in The District of Columbia v. Heller, written by Justice Scalia. This decision essentially ignored the antecedent clause only to affirm the postcedent clause. Two years later in McDonald v. City of Chicago, also a 5:4 decision, Heller was extended to all the states.\n\nSince the constitutionality of the 2nd Amendment has been decided by the Supreme Court, there are only two possibilities for constitutionally acceptable thorough gun control:\n(1) A different SCOTUS reverses Heller and McDonald.\n(2) Repeal of the 2nd Amendment, as Bret Stephens advocates.\n\nTo Make America Sane Again we must achieve either one., 10 Don't leave oily rags in a pile or they will spontaneously combust. Don't light a match where there is extra oxygen in the air. When the level of oxygen is higher than 21%, spontaneous combustion will happen more often. The US has an abnormally high level of \"weaponization\" in its cultural atmosphere, so the psychological equivalent of random sparks and piles of oily rags will inevitably result in the spontaneous combustion of mass shootings. Reduce the level of weaponization and the problem will subside. Until this happens, the statistical certainty is that Newton, Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas, and now Parkland will occur with predictable and increasing regularity., 10 George Washington did not want the United Stated to have a standing army, and the 'well-regulated militia\" in the 2nd Amendment translates to our National Guard , not gun owners with private arsenals of ar-15s in their homes. A conservative Supreme Court twisted themselves into knots to find individual rights to gun ownership. Much as I agree with the columnist, this repeal will not happen in this climate: the NRA has a stranglehold over Congress and many gun owners who have been made to feel that even minimal background checks will lead to confiscation. Welcome to our exceptionally \"American\" bloodbaths., 10 Ludicrous. As ludicrous as 'confiscate all firearms.' Repealing the Second Amendment will NEVER happen. It's not that it isn't a theoretical solution -- but it is hardly Lockian in its possibility of becoming. This opinion piece is the penultimate extreme, and it lays bare why reasonable gun control measures are so adamantly opposed by lawful gun owners: The suggestion is ludicrous. It ignores the sentiments of a substantial minority of Americans, all of whom would vigorously oppose and block repeal. It isn't a close question., 10 Politicians want to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally unfit.   Is there a clearer signal of mental unfitness than the desire to purchase a weapon designed to quickly kill large numbers of people?   \n\nLet's not overthink this one.   , 10 Repeal and do not replace. The second amendment is grossly outdated and misinterpreted beyond recognition. Repealing it alone won't end gun violence, nor will just about anything else. But repeal, along with a few other \"anything elses\" offers the hope of one day joining the ranks of civilized nations that have a small fraction of the gun deaths we do., 10 Even \u201cwell trained\u201d law enforcement officials are not immune to accidentally shooting bystanders in crisis situations, especially when they cannot immediately identify the culprit(s). I DO NOT feel safer knowing there are lots of \u201cgood guys\u201d around me in public venues armed and unshakeable in the belief that they will be ready to foil crime at any time -quite the opposite.\n\n The American trope about \u201cgood guys with guns\u201d may  have had some relevance in the days of the \u201cWild West,\u201d or in war zones, but in modern civil society,  it needs to be put to rest once and for all. , 10 If you're advocating taking on an epic battle over the 2nd amendment, why not go all the way and sue for secession?  Arguments over our right to bear arms is really just a proxy for the stark differences between red and blue states as to how a good life should be led.\n\nIf the blue states of the west coast and the northeast were to form a new and more perfect union, they could produce a grand new constitution that reflects and protects a sensible way of life that so many of us see slipping away.\n\nThe Founding Fathers weren't afraid of a little revolution.  Hitting the reset button every 250 years or so is not a bad idea., 10 One thing also to consider: Like First Amendment jurisprudence, Second Amendment jurisprudence changed radically over the last sixty years, when the \"militia\" clause was virtually ignored. So even if we were not successful in repealing the Second Amendment, we do have a prior history of interpreting it much more restrictively than in recent years. Why should the Second Amendment be interpreted more and more broadly the farther we get from its date of composition? The answer is politics, and it will take politics to bring sanity back to a debate we shouldn't be forced into in the first place. Reason won't work here. We need a succession of presidents and congresspersons who will appoint judges who know their history and respect human life. Until then, all we can do is resist., 10 The Supreme Court has not told us how much regulation is consistent with the Second Amendment.  Some states have very strict gun laws as referenced here.  The most strict of these laws have obviously not been struck down as unconstitutional, and remain on the books in New York, Massachusetts and other gun control states.  \n\nThe real battles are being fought over the laws of the various states, not over their constitutionality.  People are not contesting the Second Amendment because it is unclear how the courts would go.  Nobody wants to take the matter to the courts, because most states have the laws they want.  Contest the Second Amendment and you will be declaring war.  I would try to get you classified as seriously mentally ill for going to war and possibly losing all the protections that now exist.  Keep this battle on the local level or face Armageddon., 10 No need to \"repeal\" a Constitutional Amendment. The Third Amendment is still on the books, we just ignore it. \n\nI'm still waiting for my Equal Rights Amendment. , 10 It is generally agreed that guns should be kept from the mentally ill.  What about those who suffer mental decline after acquiring a gun?    , 10 Mr. Stephens is wittingly or unwittingly throwing sand in our eyes. \n\nThe amount of political effort to change the Constitution is enormous. The easiest path involves two-thirds of Congress voting for repeal followed by ratification by three-fourths of the states. If successful, that process will take years, perhaps decades. \n\nTalk of constitution repeal is a waste of time and oxygen. It confuses a public safety issue with a constitutional one. The issue is the lack of political will to protect the public not the Second Amendment. \n\nTalking about repeal distracts us from the issue of protecting our people. We have the means to act already. Sadly, no matter how many adults and children die, we take no action. , 10 This should be the new goal of the current generation. The fact that gun owners often threaten \u201canother civil war\u201d as the result of repeal is simply further evidence that it\u2019s necessary. , 10 Sorry, Mr. Stephens, but in my decades of either thinking that I was a conservative (as a 14-year-old Goldwater Republican) or observing conservatives since I recognized and overcame my youthful follies, almost none of the conservatives I've known have been empiricists. They have typically been so committed to their idealized preconceptions that they have been willing to overlook, deny, or try to argue around any inconvenient facts. Perhaps you and a few other conservatives have been able to change your opinions based on facts, but that has been the exception rather than the rule at least during the past 4-5 decades of American conservatism. Reality does seem to have a liberal bias, so those who are committed to staying labeled as conservatives too often need to deny reality to maintain that tribal affiliation., 10 The 1st amendment protects free speech\u2014but there are limits\u2014like not protecting  inciting the violent overthrow of government. The second amendment currently appears to be unlimited in its scope and protect gun rights over human life.  If we do not repeal or restrict the supremacy of the second amendment the only probable and humane resolution is a new Constituton., 10 Good column but I suggest that there is something very simple that can be done to add to the basis for repealing the 2d amendment and/or ending the sale of semi-automatic weapons.\n\nInterview all parents of those killed, interview all wounded survivors, interview a sample of students who experienced this terror act. The interview might include both a survey form and personal comments.\n\nI have seen in sources such as Huffington Post, but not so much in the Times, that there are students who counter Trump directly by stating \"It is about guns and about gun laws.\"\n\nThen with data in hand, confront those shown in the Times Video today, Saturday 17 November, and, by whatever means possible, Trump himself.\nShow Trump stating that it is not about guns or Trump never mentioning the words guns, automatic weapons, control of access to guns and then show students and family speaking on these subjects.\n\nThus far I find Times treatment of this matter not satisfactory. Perhaps even ask those directly involved about their emotional reactions to seeing Trump making statements. I saw a few seconds on Swedish television last night and it almost made me feel ill. How about you?\n\nOnly-NeverInSweden.blogspot.com\nDual citizen US SE, 10 It is exactly the sentiments of Mr. Stephens that has conservatives and the NRA unwilling to entertain any form of gun  control.  Threatening them with repealing the second amendment has radicalized their views and pushed them to believe that any gun control laws will take away their second amendment rights.  Let's be sensible on both sides.  , 10 The Second Amendment needs to be repealed because it is taken out of context. Conservatives once cared about the concept of \"original intent.\" The intention of the framers was clearly to arm a citizen militia. Now that the US has a standing army and police, the Second Amendment is not needed. The Supreme Court's Heller decision, allowing arms for personal protection is possibly one of its worst; a violation of all humanity, made by a conservative majority no less. Since the Second Amendment likely won't get repealed by our gutless Congress, it will be up to the states to enact gun control on the local level, given that the Supreme Court has allowed that. , 10 Here's an idea:\n\nWhy not let the NRA handle everything? Including responsibility for deciding who gets to purchase guns, and for the consequences of wrong decisions. \n\nRight now, we make it too easy for the NRA because they are like the permanent opposition party - always able to criticize those in power, but never having to take power themselves and own the decisions and policies they make. , 10 Thanks Bret.\nI agree. That's why the founders gave us the ability to amend the Constitution. \n\nLet's face it, Madison and company never envisioned automatic weapons when the drafted the Second  Amendment. It was all about muskets.  \n\nBut they also gave us the ability to amend US Constitution to keep up with the times. It's time to do just that., 10 The last mass shooting to take place in Australia was 22 years ago in 1996. It was a horrific event, but it mobilized a Conservative Prime Minister and a Conservative government to act. It had police buy weapons from the public and passed legislation restricting access to a large number of weapons.\nOf course there was an hysterical outcry initially by the \u201cgun rights\u201d crowd, but there has been a drastic fall in the number of gun deaths and injuries and suicides, and so support politically for guns has become almost nonexistent there., 10 Much is made of the \"well regulated militia\" language in the second amendment, and rightly so.  However, it should further be pointed out that the amendment refers to the right of \"the people\" to keep and bear arms.  It is clear that the writers knew the difference between \"the people\" and a \"person.\"  Just read the second and fifth amendments one after the other if you want proof. The presence of the US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Reserves and State National Guards shows that the rights the Founding Fathers intended to protect in the second amendment are in no danger of being abridged.  The NRA is simply mad and possibly Russian-backed., 10 Be practical.  That repeal will never happen.\nBut as BigFoot comments here regulations are appropriate, and in the spirit of the amendment.\nBut any change requires united Congressional action.\nAnd how can we expect a critically divided governing body that cannot compromise, that cannot agree on even basic internal issues to get anything done?\nBy logical extension, if we are able to repeal anything, it ought to be the Citizen United decision and legal corporate citizenship status which skews our one-man, one-vote democracy completely.\nWith our majority crippled, we the American people are unable to present any united vision.  We see majority opinion ignored again and again.\nOur military-industrial establishment has the power to deceive the American public through financial control of information, and create unimaginable suffering.\nIn Iraq it is estimated that in three years over one million human beings died.\nIn the Syrian Civil War- a result of the destabilization caused by the Iraq War- nearly 500,00  human beings have died during the same time span as you mention above.\nSince it is so obviously \"on-sale\" even the Russians know how to buy into the system now.\nJust look what a few crafty Russians were able to do, and try to imagine what the Kochs and all those other super-influential Corporations do every day., 10 First, repealing the Second Amendment is even less likely than passing effective gun control regulations.  Second, politically realistic and effective gun control legislation is not prevented by the Second Amendment.  Assault Rifles and similar weapons can be banned, large capacity magazines can be banned, guns can be licensed, gun owners can be registered, age limits can be put on gun ownership, and limits can be put on the ownership of pistols.  Such laws currently exist  in some states--like California--and should exist in more.  Writing about repealing the Second Amendment is a waste of time.  Instead please describe some gun control legislation that is both somewhat effective and politically realistic. That would be a real contribution to solving this problem., 10 I believe wealth imbalances are far more dangerous than guns.  Remember the pen is mightier than the sword?  The 0.01 percent is far more evil than a nation full of guns rightfully given to its citizens by a Constitution created by peoplle much smarter than what we have now., 10 If voters are interested in change from the current status quo they will remove any officeholder who has a high rating from the NRA or who receives significant campaign contributions from them.  Until I see voters mobilize in this way, I will remain pessimistic about America's commitment to reducing gun violence., 10 Slavery was enshrined in the constitution (though the word \"slave\" is not used).  The three-fifths clause and the fugitive slave clause led credibility to the abolitionist claim that the supreme law of the land protected slavery. At the start of the civil war, it is clear that many in the North were uncomfortable with the idea of taking \"property\" away from the Southerners. It's remarkable how as distasteful slavery seemed to some, they still accepted the paradigm of bondage.  I often see the fixation on establishing the 2nd Amendment as a fundamental right in the same light as I understand those that rationalized not only a moral but a constitutional right to enslave another. Truly at the heart of those that see the 2nd Amendment as their only way to ensure real liberty is a belief antithetical to our social contract. Those that champion the freedom to own guns don't really believe in the supremacy of the Constitution or the \"We the People\" for they believe at any second they must be able to protect themselves (because they can't trust the state) or they must be ready to defend themselves against tyranny. More and more, the deification of the 2nd Amendment feels unAmerican to me, and to see those that feel they need to arm themselves to the teeth as a wrecking ball to our social order and future.  Their fixation on the 2nd amendment must be marginalized and delegitimated. , 10 Stephens is trying to be \"provocative\" I'm sure, because he must know the barriers to amending the constitutions are vastly greater than simply enacting gun legislation, and we can't even do the latter. So, no, Bret, amending the constitution is neither plausible in the foreseeable future, nor necessary.\n\nA far simpler course of action is to defeat lots of Republicans and elect lots of Democrats. Full stop. Might not be diplomatic to say so, but that's the reality. The composition of the courts follows election returns, and only by getting a decent judiciary will we be able to jettison the absurd, maximally \"pro-gun\" interpretation of the second amendment (an interpretation plenty of eminent constitutional scholars think is hokum, I might add)., 10 The second amendment was justified by the stated need to form a militia. What wasn't stated, was the purpose of that militia. Scholars have pointed out, that the militias were necessary to capture or kill runaway slaves or to quell slave uprisings. No mention of self protection, hunting or target practice can be found in the actual bill of rights. I submit that the ownership of these archaic one-shot muskets and pistols of the 18th century were probably fairly common, but the legitimizing of the citizens' militia, for the purpose of re-capturing slaves, was the main purpose behind the amendment. Hunting for food was probably more of an assumption in the wilderness of early America. Southern, and some Border and Northern States as well, wanted to legitimize the hunting and killing of African Americans. If they could do it under the guise of an organized militia, it would be legal. Do we still live in that kind of society? Did we not answer that question in the Civil War of 1861-1865? We can amend the Constitution and we can amend the Amendments. Let's do it, now., 10 \"A well regulated militia ...\"\nThe superseding clauses of the 2nd Amendment meant something when passed.\nTrue, the Amendment dealt primarily with the ability of the \"militia\" or gathering of all men to bear arms.  In those days, \"arms\" meant individual weapons used in personal combat or personal defense.\nWhy was that preamble included in the Amendment?\nWasn't the prohibition against infringing right to bear arms sufficient in itself?\nWhat if the Supreme Court interpreted today those introductory clauses to indicate the intent for Congress to regulate, in some ways, the arms of the \"militia\"?\n\"Arms\" is the sticky word.  What should be covered by the Amendment?\nToday, with the advancement of science and technology, as well as arms manufacturers, \"arms\" could mean everything that a person could carry.\nThis includes even bazookas and hand carried anti-aircraft missiles or even personal nuclear tactical weapons.\nI've stated the obvious and ridiculous that very few would consider \"arms\" in the sense of reading the 2nd Amendment.\nThe right to bear \"arms\" is not unrestricted and not absolute thereby.\nThe shooter in Las Vegas had weapons that he had augmented to act like military battlefield weapons of mass destruction, though the mass of people killed or injured was a relatively small number and not a huge \"mass\", other than to those whose family would never return home.\nPerhaps the approach of whittling away in small persistent steps will be the only practical approach., 10 The majority of Americans (including gun owners) support reasonable gun control laws. \n\nUnfortunately, the majority of Americans (including parents)  give absolute veto power to the extremist views of a minority of gun owners because they, unlike the extremists, are not single issue, energized voters.\n\nGun extremists believe the only thing keeping the government from oppressing them, is their stockpile of guns. It's not about hunting, or even crime. It's a fantasy about being the last line of defense against tyranny. \n\nThey cannot be reasoned with, and they will not compromise.  But they can be out voted and they can be outspent.\n\nUntil the majority makes support for gun control an absolute litmus test through a number of election cycles, even outlawing bump stocks is impossible. Repealing the 2nd amendment is a fantasy. And the most likely result of this weeks mass shooting will be a further loosening of gun laws., 10 Unfortunately, the Constitution itself makes it all but impossible to amend it even if a sizable majority favor it.  It would be an expensive waste of time and resources to try.\n\nFor now, I would be happy with stronger limits on types of guns that can be owned and reasonable criteria for precluding dangerous people from owning guns., 10 There is a problem with people with guns killing lots of people.  When an anti-gun person comes up with a solution to the problem of mass killings, pro-gun people say that the solution will never work for one reason or another.  But I have never seen a pro-gun person propose his own solution.  The only thing I can conclude is that pro-gun people don't think that mass killings is a serious problem.  , 10 The amendment does not have to be repealed.  Magazine fed semi automatic rifles can simply be included in the 1934 National Firearms Act by Congress and heavily regulated by the ATF as are fully automatic weapons., 10 As I read this column and the reader's comments It occurs to me that there is a clear understanding what the problem relative to guns is in this country.  In any democracy, this would not be a problem.  As I see it the real problem is that we do not have a functioning democracy. Why?  The answer is the corrupting power of money.  Caused by, the equivalence of money and speech (thanks to the SCOTUS) and the cost of running for office.  Instead of publically financed elections with free televised, rational fact-based debates, we spend huge quantities of money on jingoism/propaganda., 10 When I was a kid I lived on a farm.  All the men were hunters.  They used single shot, double barrel and pump action shotguns, bolt action, lever action and pump action rifles.  A few had six shooter revolvers.  No one had a semi-automatic anything.\n\nI remember being appalled the first time I saw someone (a non-farmer) use a semi-automatic shotgun.  It seemed so unsportsmanlike and unfair to the wild game.\n\nFrom my perspective, there is no need for any private citizen to own a \u201csemi-automatic\u201d shotgun, rifle or pistol of any kind.  A sensible regulation would ban any type of semi-automatic weapon.  , 10 We do not need to repeal the 2nd amendment, just the 5-4 decision by the US Supreme Court that gave it a distorted meaning allowing individuals to possess weapons regardless of whether they are in a state militia.  Change one judge and then we can enact sensible laws., 10 While I enthusiastically support various forms of significant gun control, I just wish Stephens and Times commenters showed equivalent outrage about drunk, drugged, and texting drivers who kill more people each year than gun owners do. , 10 I like saying that we should repeal the Second Amendment, and then listening to the predictable contradictions: \"It will never be repealed! Because, well. It just never will. Dream on.\" OK. Thanks for sharing.\n\nIt's so much more to the point than saying we need effective background checks and listening to a hundred talking points planned in advance to whittle it down and fill it with loopholes. Or to suggest restricting assault weapons and get drawn into a disingenuous pseudo-debate over the definition of an assault weapon. In the end they always wend back to the Second Amendment, which ultimately won't allow any effective limits on gun violence. \n\nIt used to be Constitutional to put rational limits on guns. Then in the last few decades they decided that the right to guns is absolute. \n\nThe need to repeal the Second Amendment was created by this new absolutism, this radical re-interpretation that the new right pushed through the courts. \n\nYou'd think that when support for repealing it spreads and it starts to look like repeal is going to happen, they'll come to their senses and let us do something about gun violence. But guns are nearly a religion now, and maybe they can't come to their senses. So be it. The Second Amendment has do go. \n\nWe ended slavery. Some people loved slavery more than they loved their country and fought, but we won. We ended Jim Crow. We legalized gay marriage. Change can happen on that scale. We might as well get to work now and get it done., 10 \"Conservatives are supposed to be empiricists, not idealists.\"\n\nConservatism aims to conserve a small clique's wealth and influence ('standing athwart history, yelling stop, defending privilege'). It is a gold-plated form of idealism that have little use for empiricism., 10 More children are lost through opioids than guns - why no outcry against 'big pharma'?  And while we're on the subject, against the FBI whose contributory negligence is as much a causation? , 10 Some fraction of the American people \u2014 not small, but not a majority \u2014 are convinced or have been convinced that the governments of this country cannot be trusted to keep gun regulation reasonable. NRA propaganda is partly responsible for this. And the Republican Party is partly responsible for it. The result of it is that America, uniquely in the world, tolerates an insanely unregulated ubiquity of guns and, as a consequence, the drip drip drip of bloody, horrible deaths. The only way to make a dent in this insanity is for the rational majority to become so fed up with it that we have an election in which every single Republican who can be defeated is defeated. The Party has become an essentially monolithic \"no\" on even the tiniest moves toward sensible regulation. Unfortunately, the prospects for such a side-lining of the Party are not as great as many of us would like, principally because the GOP can count on (1) structural biases toward rural voters, (2) gerrymandering, (3) the fanaticism of the pro-gun base, and (4) the natural tendency of reasonable voters not to focus on single issues. So here we are., 10 We could just rename the National Guard the \"Militia\". And if you are not in the militia, you don't get to keep a military style weapon. It might work. \n\nBetter still, we could modify the National Firearms Act of 1934 that prohibits automatic weapons. This law works. We could pass a similar one that prohibits semi-automatics and all firearms with loading speed and capacity above a fixed cylinder pistol.\n\nBetter still, mandatory training, a database of guns and their owners, and responsibility that is tied to the gun owner, even if it's stolen or lost.\n\nThe above ideas will only work if we vote out the people that trade lives for political gain. , 10 Calling for the repeal of the 2nd amendment is absurd. It will never happen. It's nearly impossible to get the Constitution changed, which was of course the Founders\u2019 intent. To repeal the 2nd Amendment you would need a 2/3 majority vote in both the House & the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by 2/3 of the State legislatures. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by constitutional convention. While the 2/3 majority approval to propose amending isn't rare (11,623 have been proposed), only 33 such proposals actually made it through all the Congressional debates & votes to make it out of Congress to the states for ratification. There any circulated amendment proposal faces an even bigger challenge, as per the Constitution 3/4 of the states must vote \u2018Aye for the proposal to become an actual Amendment. Only 27 have been ratified, but the first 10, The Bill of Rights, were ratified before the end 1790. In the 226 years since then, only 17 of the 1,192 proposed amendments have made it all the way through proposal, debate, vote, distribution to the states, debate, vote, & ratification (1.4%). And two of those were about alcohol. The result of that was organized crime and general lawlessness. The gun control crowd should be very careful what they wish for, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. There's simply no way a Prohibition era-type period of violence could be avoided. It would be easier to pass good gun control laws., 10 My modest proposal: draft all the gun owners.  If you are a gun owner, then presumably you are a member of the \u201cwell-regulated militia.\u201d  I, for one, can\u2019t see how a militia can be well regulated if we don\u2019t know who it\u2019s members are or what armament they can bring to bear if summoned to protect our homeland.  The militia (gun owners) should be training together on a regular basis, say 2-weeks every year.  Require that all firearms be registered with the militia so that in the event that the militia is called up, we can provide the necessary ammunition.  I bet that even Antonio Scalia would have a hard time arguing with that!, 10 There was a time that Americans decided that booze was a societal ill and amended the Constitution to ban it. In time (truly not that long a time) it became evident that the amendment was not working so an amendment was passed to repeal it. Fast forward to the 21st century. The 2nd amendment is no longer working as written. It's not rocket science, the founding fathers told gave us the tools to change the constitution if needed (suggesting their realization that what they'd written may not be working in the future). It simply depends on citizens calling for change and our politicians having the guts to get the ball rolling even in the face of NRA intimidation. , 10 The only thing that will change the dynamic is to hit Americans where it counts most: the pocketbook.\nWhy not organize an international tourist boycott of states with loose gun laws starting with Florida? See the Disney Corporation and the hotel and restaurant industry going nuts because of loss revenue.\nThen make gun manufacturers financially liable for the injuries caused by the use of their products. Gun owners too should be financially liable and be required to take out insurance as they do for car ownership.\n\nThis is a lot simpler than amending the Constitution which for all intents and purposes a non-starter., 10 The only way to remove an amendment from the Constitution is by means of another amendment.  2/3'rds of the House and the Senate would have to approve the change.  We already know that isn't going to happen.\nThe alternative is for 33 state legislatures to call for a Constitutional Convention. In order for an amendment to be ratified by the Convention process, 38 states  must vote to do so.  Given the demonstrated inability of our elected state or national representatives to meaningfully address this issue, the odds of ever removing the 2nd amendment are, unfortunately, microscopic.    , 10 Amen to everything in this column. We Americans declared our independence because we believe that all persons have the rights to LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The culture of gun love in America has gone way beyond anything having to do with \"a well-regulated militia\" and has become a power fetish. Nothing less than a cultural change is necessary. \n\nUnfortunately, \"conservatives\" stopped being empiricists decades ago, and are now pure ideologues. Any Republican who strays from ideological purity is labeled a RINO. \n\nThe gun lobby, and the culture of gun fetishism have inculcated a disregard for children's lives, for all of our lives, that is nauseating. Anyone who is willing to stomach the mass slaughter of schoolchildren--first graders, in the case of Sandy Hook Elementary School--to protect their \"Second Amendment rights\" has lost sight of our basic human rights stated in the Declaration of Independence. \n\nThat is especially true of those who are our Congressional representatives and are supposed to serve us. Vote 'em out before the next Sandy Hook. It's only getting worse. , 10 We are not a civilized country when citizens get randomly gunned down and killed  for no reason  practically every day and frequently in mass murders. If we were to become a civilized country, we would have courts that interpret the second amendment and similar state laws to be a privilege and not a right to own a gun for self defense . We would then need to look to other civilized countries and see how they  regulate the privilege of gun ownership. In Israel, a citizen may obtain a single gun only after physical and mental evaluation by safety officers and not before age 27 unless a member of  the military or retired from the military.\nThe more difficult issue is banning the NRA as a criminal organization enabling domestic terrorists and meddling in 2016 election using Russian money. The evils of Citizens United, dirty Russian money flowing to the GOP coupled with a GOP attempt to undermine an FBI investigation and discredit the FBI again makes this country uncivilized and all of this threatens our national security.\nFinally there has to be a massive attempt to get guns off the street. The number of guns in this country is insane., 10 Well if the pro-gun people think that mental health is the problem, make gun owners prove that they are sane to keep their guns.\n\nI'm dubious, but if that's what they are offering ..., 10 We can probably blame the writers of the second amendment for the confusion over the meaning of the amendment.  I can't think of any part of the constitution with a more convoluted sentence structure.  It could have clearly stated that citizens of this country have the right to own guns.  Or it could have said that citizens have he right to bear arms only in \"well-regulated militia.\"   Many think the latter was the intent of the amendment to protect states against an over aggressive federal government.   I agree with Mr.  Stevens that that the second amendment should be repealed, but replaced with what?  If the responsibility for gun laws were placed in the hands of congress, who knows what gun laws we would get.  The likelihood that repeal of the second amendment would ever be ratified by the requisite number of states is highly unlikely, so our best bet it to elect Democrats who are much more likely to introduce some sensible gun safety measures., 10 The founders and framers never envisioned a lot of heavily armed loners with a grudge as part of their \"well-regulated militia...\" The militia is critical to the success or failure of the Second Amendment. A militia means that you have to spend time with your fellow citizens who will notice those with problems, at least the most obvious. Also the Militia has some responsibility for the actions of its members so the state citizens militia has a stake in controlling their armed members just to avoid liability. \n\nLets re-establish the citizen militia under that auspices of the current state militia/police, require screening, training, discipline and liability along with regular drills. Also these fine citizens come out and assist during emergencies and the militia and the state are liable for anything their members due with their weapons on or off duty., 10 As with most substantive issues in the tension, the force field, between individual rights and the need for social order, there are complexities.  My take on the argument over the Second Amendment is that we neglect the first part of the Second Amendment at our peril.  We have shifted the focus from a right designed to support the defense of our nation from enemies foreign and domestic to an absolute right of each and every citizen independent of the larger societal context.  By myopically interpreting this right as a sacred right of each and every citizen independent of the context to preserve social order, we put that social order at extreme risk.\n\nIf the Supreme Court, especially the strict constructionists, are blind to the historical context of the Second Amendment, the advantages of militias over a standing army, then we should seriously consider clarifying the issues.  We have a standing Army (and Navy and Marine Corps and Air Force and Coast Guard).  We have militias, our reserve units, in readiness.  We no longer require private citizens to have military armaments available and ready to heed the call to arms.  It is time to take Mr. Stephens suggestion seriously and let the States determine the contexts under which firearms are permissible to ordinary citizens., 10 The problem is the totally perverted interpretation by the Supreme Court conservative majority which ignored the clearly stated limitation of the Second Amendment, that people can carry arms under a well-regulated militia.  Moreover, as I stated before, if people insist on an \"originalist\" interpretation of the Amendment, let us be coherent and give them the weapons that the framers had in mind: a musket and a flintlock pistol.  We can all live with that., 10 Finally an op-ed that tackles the ultimate American political taboo: the fact that our Constitution is anachronistic. Most democratic countries in the world regularly amend their constitutions, or formally revise them, to keep up with evolving realities. The American Constitution is difficult to amend: only 27 amendments have been ratified in our history, the last one ratified in 1992 was proposed in 1789!  Our Constitution, as brilliant as it was in 1789, with its archaic language and muddled delineation between state and federal jurisdictions, has led to a country ruled by litigation rather than by law. The cryptic 2nd amendment is only a symptom of this structural flaw. The first amendment to be proposed should be one to allow for constitutional amendments by referendum. Or perhaps we should hold another National Convention and refound the republic based on a modernized Constitution.  , 10 \"It\u2019s true that a gun in the right hands at the right time and place can save lives, as the former National Rifle Association instructor Stephen Willeford proved when he shot Kelley as the latter emerged from the church.\"\n\n This is absolute nonsense. The idea that vigilantes should take public safety into their own hand is insane. Unless he or she is a trained, payed and disciplined public law enforcement officer, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GOOD GUY WITH A GUN. Anyone, anyone, repeat \u2014 anyone who takes a gun into a public place with the intention of possibly using it to shoot someone else is not a \"good guy,\" but a public menace. \n\nImagine this simple scenario: a football stadium full of people, a mass shooter and three good guys with guns. How do you tell the difference between the murderer and the others? What happens when the \"good guys\" start shooting into the crowd? Start shooting at one of the other \"good guys\" because they think he's the killer? \n\nKelley had already emerged from the church when Willeford shot him, and we have no idea what he was going to do next. Likely run for it. It's great that he didn't get away, but there is no proof Willeford actually saved any lives. \n\nThe police have a motto: every officer is responsible for every bullet he fires. Not so your NRA instructors or any other vigilantes. DO NOT BUY INTO THE NONSENSE THAT THE SOLUTION TO GUN VIOLENCE IS MORE GUNS!, 10 Nothing will persuade people that the right to live is more \"sacred\" than the right to own a high-powered killing machine.\n\nThat word \"sacred\" applied to the right to build up an armory, or even to own one lethal high-powered weapon capable of killing a lot of people in a hurry is disgusting, nauseating.\n\nJesus wept!, 10 There is an undeniable utility to firearms. However that utility is fully served by bolt-action rifles, revolvers, and traditional shotguns. The sophisticated weapons so widely available now to private citizens are the fetish-objects of people with serious control issues. In their violent fantasies the cruel mechanical beauty of their incredibly powerful weaponry enables them to be the masters of the deadly circumstances conjured up in the privacy of their minds. A significant few however are unable to contain their fantasies and they act out their their conviction that deadly force is the most elegant solution to the conflicts that they have come to believe deeply in.\nThe politically active membership of the NRA is best understood as a cult. The leadership of the NRA in D.C. is best understood as a professional for-profit lobbying organization that has become the embodiment of Upton Sinclair's observation that \"it's hard to make a man understand something when his job depends on his not understanding it\". Most disappointingly, the Supreme Court through the combination of it's 2nd amendment and Citizens United decisions has simultaneously rejected its own responsibility to provide a check and balance and destroyed Congress's ability to do the same. It's not the 2nd amendment per se, it's the way it's read. For most of our history it was interpreted as the fundamental law permitting gun control. , 10 The proportion of gun owners who pose a danger to others is small and the type and kind of legal weapons that they own does not make gun owners more or less dangerous. \n\nMental illness does not necessarily make people more dangerous than people who do not suffer those ailments. All people are capable of becoming driven by extremes of emotions which can make them behave irrationally. \n\nThe right to keep and to bear arms makes requiring people to prove that they can use and assure that their arms are secured safely difficult to assure. With so many guns out there with little knowledge of who has them, the likelihood of guns being in the hands of those who would misuse them is virtually certain. Amending or repealing the Second Amendment could help. But all the responsible gun owners should be assured that it\u2019s not just to eliminate their ability to keep and use them as they have, or it won\u2019t happen., 10 \"Accurate, deadly and dependable\"--an add for bullets on a web site.  The 2nd amendment will never be repealed.  We need to limit ammunition production and distribution.  We need tough laws for those selling guns and bullets to those who should not be in possession.  Parents must be held accountable for allowing minors access to guns. Guns and bullets should be exchanged for tax credits.   The tobacco industry knew their product was dangerous--certainly a public health issue--and ultimately have paid huge settlements in class action suits.  The gun and bullet industry should be held accountable and subjected to the same legal scrutiny.  Last, the Congressional leaders who have failed to protect their constituents must be challenged in the court of public opinion and be removed from office.  , 10 Thank you, Bret. In support of your recommendation to repeal the 2nd Amendment, I add my outrage over the NRA claiming that doctors who ask patients if they have guns in the home violate the 2nd amendment. Thankfully, an appeals court ruled that restricting physicans violates their first amendment rights. I am a pediatric nurse practitioner, and I have asked and will continue to ask parents of children if they have guns in the home. As the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends if there are guns in the home, I advise parents that the guns be locked up and unloaded and the ammunition be kept separate from the guns. I recommend that they follow these safety guidelines. No one will tell me what I can or cannot say to ensure that my patients are safe. I will continue to violate the second amendment, if that's what it takes. , 10 The authors of the 2nd amendment would be appalled at the carnage its abuse has caused. In their time Americans didn't come from \"America\" or the \"United States;\" their \"country\" was Pennsylvania or Maryland or Massachusetts. Their countries were defended by militias without which the American colonies could not have pulled off the American Revolution. The founding fathers replaced this system with a national military, but Americans abused by their colonial masters in Europe, suspicious of centralized authority, and committed to grassroots democracy, were understandably reluctant to part with their weapons. That era has passed. What's replaced it is a country awash in weaponry that's being used to slaughter school kids, concert goers, movie goers, nightclub patrons, co-workers, et al. with no end in sight and no way to predict when and where the next atrocity will occur, while our political class is immobilized by a reign of terror imposed by a minority of hysterical gun addicts led by the NRA. The second amendment was intended to protect national security and buttress democracy under very specific historical circumstances. Today, under very different circumstances, it's doing the opposite. Reinterpreting it through the courts won't guarantee its abuse in the future. The only sure way to protect public safety and our democracy is to repeal it altogether. The only way to ensure that the NRA and its force of armed intimidation ends its reign of terror is to outlaw it. , "
