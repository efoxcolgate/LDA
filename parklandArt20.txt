Insurance.  Gun owners would have to take out insurance policies (or a bond).  The requirement and cost would be set by the insurance companies based on the potential lethality of the weapon and the risk posed by the owner.  A shotgun used primarily for hunting and/or sport shooting might, and owned by someone who stores it in a locked gun safe, and a clean record, might carry no cost premium at all.  On the other hand, the cost for someone like Nikolas Cruise to insure an AR-15 might have been so prohibitive (or denied altogether) that it would not be possible to legally purchase that weapon.\n\nNaturally this does nothing to prevent the trade of illegal weapons, but in nearly all of these mass murders, these guns were legally purchased.

It confers a right on Americans that is inconvenient to some who believe that individual rights should be maximally subordinated to the perception of some that collective rights are far more important \u2013 when those collective rights happen to agree with the \u201csome\u2019s\u201d worldview, irrespective of individual rights as guaranteed in a written constitution.", "com#": 641}, {"articleID": 20, "comBody": "We don't necessarily need to repeal the 2nd, just interpret it in the view of those who wrote it. Note that it BEGINS with \"A well regulated Militia...\". This states two very distinct ideas. First, \"well regulated\". That should allow congress to make any laws it deems necessary for the protection of the public regarding arms. Second, is the term \"militia\", defined as \"a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army\". We have such a force already. It is called the National Guard. So, a proper interpretation of the opening clause of the 2nd Amendment would be that you have to be in the Guard (militia) to qualify for the rest of the amendment. And you would be subject to regulations as necessary. And this interpretation should please the originalists since it is based on what the situation was at that time.", "com#": 642}, {"articleID": 20, "comBody": "In holding that the Second Amendment is an individual right, the Supreme Court stated that the right was subject to reasonable regulations. A reasonable regulation would be banning assault weapons as we dis from 1994 to 2004. We could also regulate the amount of ammunition that could be purchased. But that would require politicians who weren't in the pocket of the NRA . Which largely means Democrats. So that's how we need to vote until the GOP comes to its senses.", "com#": 643}]
