Before airbags became ubiquitous, cars with airbags cost less to insure than those with just seat belts.  Also, drivers with clean driving records pay much lower premiums than those with speeding tickets or DUIs/DWIs.  Sadly, and illogically, there is no risk premium for gun ownership.  Hunters of all kinds tend not to use automatic weapons and, in my opinion, are very safety conscious.  Hunters' risk/insurance premiums, therefore, would be quite reasonable.  Having a criminal record or prior incidences of irresponsible gun usage will drive premiums up.  Logically, owning a single gun to protect your property or for rabbit hunting would be less expensive than owning dozens of military style assault rifle.  Automobile safety improved, as you correctly noted, with incremental improvements in technology.  But a large part of that increase in safety was also driven by \"cost of ownership\", including the cost of insurance.  Let's price gun ownership according to it's true risks.
